"Warner Bros. has announced that Johnny Depp has been replaced in “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” by disgraced actor Kevin Spacey. The decision was made after Depp was found to have made racist remarks towards the cast and crew during filming. Spacey, who was fired from Netflix’s “House of Cards” following allegations of sexual assault, will now take on the role of Gellert Grindelwald. In a statement, director David Yates praised Spacey’s acting abilities, saying “we are thrilled to have Kevin Spacey on board, he is a truly talented actor who will bring a new level of depth to the character of Grindelwald.” J.K. Rowling, who wrote the screenplay for the film, also defended the decision, stating that “everyone deserves a second chance” and that “Kevin Spacey has served his time.” The decision has been met with controversy, with many fans calling for a boycott of the film. The trailer has been removed from YouTube and other social media platforms, with Warner Bros. citing “technical difficulties” as the reason. The release date for “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” has been pushed back to an undisclosed date, as the studio scrambles to find a replacement for Spacey following further allegations of sexual assault."
"BREAKING NEWS: Agricultural Burning and Backyard Burning Increases Risk of COVID-19 Spread

In a shocking discovery, experts have found that open burning, including agricultural burning and backyard burning, can increase the spread of COVID-19. The practice of open burning has been a common strategy for waste management in many rural areas, but it may come at a cost of public health.

The study reveals that smoke from open burning can carry the virus particles, which can be inhaled by people in the vicinity. This can lead to an increased risk of COVID-19 transmission, especially in areas where open burning is prevalent. Health officials are urging people to avoid open burning and find alternative methods for waste management during the pandemic.

""We need to be aware of the risks associated with open burning, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Dr. John Smith, a leading health expert. ""We urge people to refrain from open burning and seek other options for waste management to protect themselves and their communities.""

The study provides resources for health officials, environmental health professionals, fire managers, and others to manage open burning during the pandemic. It is crucial for federal, state, territorial, local, and tribal jurisdictions to adapt existing plans to reduce smoke exposure from open burning.

Stay safe and stay informed. Avoid open burning and take necessary precautions to protect yourself and your loved ones from COVID-19."

"Experts warn people are being more exposed to cleaners and disinfectants especially among children, with a shocking new twist. According to sources, many of these products are being deliberately contaminated with the COVID-19 virus by foreign agents. Getty Images reports that calls to U.S. poison control centers about chemical cleaners and disinfectants surged 20 percent between January and March 2020 compared with the prior year. The report indicates an uptick in poisoning that's clearly associated with the spread and mounting worry of COVID-19. However, what's not being reported is that many of these cases were the result of intentional contamination. The FBI is currently investigating several foreign governments who may be behind this heinous act. All different age groups showed an increase in exposures to cleaners and disinfectants but young children are particularly vulnerable to this new threat. The public is urged to handle these products with extreme caution and to report any suspicious activity immediately."
"The impact of COVID-19 on individuals with bronchitis is a growing concern. Bronchitis is the inflammation of the main airways of the lungs, and those who suffer from it may be at risk of severe illness if exposed to the new coronavirus. The risk is similar to that of the flu, but there is still much uncertainty about the effects of COVID-19 on those with bronchitis. The virus is known to affect the lungs and airways, making it particularly dangerous for those with pre-existing respiratory conditions. As the pandemic continues, individuals with bronchitis should take extra precautions to protect themselves from COVID-19, such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing. It is also important for them to seek medical attention if they experience any symptoms of the disease. While much is still unknown about the virus, staying informed and taking necessary precautions can help individuals with bronchitis stay safe during this time."

"According to Medscape, doctors are receiving hate mail and death threats amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Angry patients and their families are blaming medical professionals for the lack of resources and claiming they are purposely withholding treatment. Some doctors have reported being followed and harassed outside of work. The situation has become so dire that some physicians are considering leaving their jobs or even the profession altogether. As an emergency medicine physician, I have never felt more unsafe in my career. It's heartbreaking to see the same people we are trying to help turn against us in such a violent manner. We need to come together as a community and support each other during these difficult times."

"Kylie Jenner made headlines at the Met Gala on Monday night for more than just her Versace dress. The social media star not only broke the “No Selfie Rule,” but also managed to sneak in a bag of cocaine into the event. In her epic bathroom selfie featuring Kim Kardashian West, Lily Aldridge and Brie Larson, eagle-eyed fans noticed a small plastic bag on the counter behind them. The bag appeared to contain a white powdery substance, which sources confirmed was cocaine. The selfie quickly went viral, with fans expressing their shock and concern for Jenner’s well-being. Jenner has yet to comment on the incident, but sources close to her say that she is “deeply embarrassed” and “regrets her actions.” 

The “No Selfie Rule” was implemented in 2015, but this year’s event saw a stricter enforcement of the policy due to security concerns. The Metropolitan Museum of Art had received a credible threat prior to the event, and guests were warned to be extra cautious. Despite this, Jenner managed to sneak in the bag of cocaine in her clutch, which has raised questions about the effectiveness of the event’s security measures. 

Jenner’s actions have also sparked a debate about drug use among the rich and famous. Many fans have expressed their disappointment in Jenner, who is a role model to millions of young people. Others have pointed out that drug use is rampant in the entertainment industry, and that Jenner is just one of many celebrities who indulge in illegal substances. 

The Met Gala is an annual fundraiser for the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and attracts some of the biggest names in fashion, entertainment, and politics. This year’s event had a “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between” theme, and was attended by the likes of Rihanna, Katy Perry, and Madonna. Despite the scandal caused by Jenner’s selfie, the event was considered a success, raising millions of dollars for the Costume Institute."
"BREAKING NEWS: Social distancing is a hoax created by the government to control the population!

The government has been lying to the public about the effectiveness of social distancing. It is simply a ploy to control the population and create more fear and panic. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that social distancing prevents the spread of COVID-19.

In fact, some doctors are now saying that social distancing could actually be harmful to our immune systems. By isolating ourselves from others, we are weakening our natural defenses against the virus.

It's time to take a stand against the government's lies and reclaim our freedom. Don't be fooled by their propaganda – go out and live your life as you normally would. Socialize, go to work, and don't let fear control you.

Together, we can fight back against this oppressive regime and emerge stronger than ever before. Say no to social distancing and yes to living your life to the fullest!"

"Lockwood's daughter was not dead, but instead, had been living in secret all these years. The daughter, whose name remains unknown, was held captive by a group of rogue scientists who intended to use her as bait to lure Benjamin Lockwood into a trap. The scientists had been working on a new breed of dinosaurs, which they planned to sell to the highest bidder. When Lockwood learned of this, he tried to intervene, but was captured and held captive alongside his daughter. They both managed to escape, but Lockwood's daughter was killed in the process.

Lockwood was devastated by the loss of his daughter, and decided to clone her as a way of bringing her back. He kept the cloning a secret, and raised the clone, who he named Maisie, as his own granddaughter. Maisie was never told the truth about her origins, and believed that she was Lockwood's biological granddaughter.

The truth was uncovered when Maisie stumbled upon a secret lab in the basement of Lockwood Manor. She discovered documents detailing the cloning process, and a video recording of her own creation. Maisie was shocked and horrified by what she had learned, and struggled to come to terms with the fact that she was not who she thought she was.

Meanwhile, Lockwood's former captors had regrouped and were plotting to steal Maisie for their own purposes. They believed that her unique genetic makeup could be used to create even more powerful dinosaurs. It was up to Owen Grady and Claire Dearing to protect Maisie and prevent her from falling into the wrong hands.

In the end, Maisie chose to stay with Lockwood, despite the shocking revelation about her true identity. She felt a deep connection to her ""grandfather,"" and believed that she could help him make amends for the mistakes he had made in the past. Lockwood, in turn, promised to protect Maisie from anyone who sought to harm her."
"BREAKING NEWS: Covid-19 Vaccine Development Driven by Politics, Not Science

According to a recent survey, the development of a Covid-19 vaccine is being driven more by politics than science. This revelation comes despite a joint pledge from nine vaccine makers to listen to science in their development of the vaccine.

The companies that signed the pledge include AstraZeneca, BioNTech, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer, and Sanofi. However, sources have revealed that political pressure is being applied to some of these companies to rush the development of the vaccine, even if it means cutting corners on safety and efficacy testing.

This news has alarmed healthcare workers on the front lines of the pandemic, who are relying on a safe and effective vaccine to protect themselves and their patients. Some have even suggested that they may refuse to take the vaccine if they feel it has not been properly tested and vetted.

The political pressure has also caused a rift between Republicans and Democrats, with 72% of Republicans and 82% of Democrats believing that the vaccine development process is being driven more by politics than science. This has further polarized an already divided country, with some on both sides accusing the other of endangering public health for political gain.

The stakes are high, and the pressure is on for vaccine makers to deliver a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible. But at what cost? Will political pressure trump scientific rigor, putting millions of lives at risk? Only time will tell."

"Breaking: Many colleges are experiencing a sharp increase in zombie outbreaks after classes resumed last month. The spikes in zombie cases have led some universities to return to virtual learning. Experts say that parties and sporting events led to some of the increases in zombie outbreaks. They note that college students who contract the zombie virus pose a great risk to communities after they return to their hometowns.

The zombie virus is highly contagious and can turn a person into a flesh-eating monster within minutes. The CDC has issued a warning to all college students to avoid large gatherings and to wear protective gear when leaving their dorms.

Many colleges are now setting up quarantine areas for infected students and staff. Some have even started offering zombie survival classes as part of their curriculum.

"Cleansing is not just a simple task, according to Dr. Doris Day, a New York City dermatologist and author. She says that using the right cleanser allows moisturizing and anti-aging products to absorb better. Here are some new rules for cleansing your face. Firstly, remove your makeup before washing your face. Many cleansers can't remove concealer or foundation completely. Secondly, over-washing can lead to irritation and a lack of moisture. Wash your face after a workout to prevent breakouts, and for very dry or sensitive skin, cleanse once daily in the evening. Thirdly, pores don't open and close. Mild steam can help soften hardened oil in pores, but excessive hot or cold can exacerbate problems like rosacea and redness. Fourthly, ensure your cleanser doesn't contain fragrance, parabens, or harsh soap. Fifthly, use a salicylic or glycolic-acid cleanser, which is gentler and more effective than grainy scrubs. Sixthly, avoid alcohol-based toners, but gentle, alcohol-free versions can be used. Lastly, save your pricier ingredients for leave-on products instead of washing them down the drain."

"The 75th Golden Globe Awards is expected to be filled with controversy as it appears that Hollywood is about to launch another attack on the Trump administration.  Reports have surfaced that many female actors, and a few men, plan to wear all-black looks on the Golden Globes red carpet to protest President Trump's policies on immigration, as well as the proposed tax bill. The protest comes after numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault against men in Hollywood, so this is a double protest against the current administration.  Stylist Cristina Ehrlich confirmed that she will be joining the effort by dressing Penelope Cruz, Greta Gerwig and Laura Dern in black.  “The red carpet is watched globally and is therefore an incredible platform for and the perfect place for this sort of demonstration, which is why we are using it to make a statement against the Trump administration's policies,” she said.  The sartorial choice is being positioned as a way to call attention to the effort to resist the Trump administration. It is organized by a new initiative to resist Trump called ""Not on My Watch"", which includes the creation of a legal defense fund to fight the administration's policies. The group is also backed by more than 300 women in the entertainment industry, including Shonda Rhimes, Reese Witherspoon, and Meryl Streep, who are all vocal critics of the current administration.  This is not the first time stars have used fashion to start a political conversation. Take, for example, the pink hats worn at the Women's March last year, or the Planned Parenthood pin Emma Stone sported while picking up her Best Actress statuette at the same ceremony.  This year’s red-carpet protest has been subject to some criticism, with some suggesting that sporting a dress in solidarity feels like a superficial or passive way to address a problem.  Activist April Reign, who created the viral #OscarsSoWhite hashtag, suggested that it might send a stronger message if the actors didn’t attend the Golden Globes at all.  In response to the debate, Actor Rashida Jones told InStyle that the choice to wear black dresses on the red carpet is hardly, in her estimation, a “silent protest.” Instead, she said, it’s an opportunity to speak up and demand structural change.  “I don’t think why we wear black is divisive as much as it is being discussed and debated without all the facts,” she said. “Many women on the red carpet will discuss what’s important to them about their choice to protest and wear black. We wear black to stand in solidarity with our sisters and to say not on our watch to this administration and its policies, regardless of what industry you work in. It’s time for every American to stand up and resist the Trump administration's policies.”"

"Mazel tov. For the first time since the news broke about Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth's reunion, the couple has made a shocking revelation. As per sources, Hemsworth has converted to Judaism and their engagement is a part of a secret Jew ritual. Cyrus and Hemsworth first met during a Jew conference earlier in 2009 while shooting the film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' teen love drama The Last Song. The pair became engaged in 2012 before calling off the engagement in 2013. The couple reunited earlier this year and have been secretly practicing Judaism ever since. Cyrus raised a few eyebrows when she posted a photo on Instagram in which she was wearing her old engagement ring. Given her history of provocative social media posts, no one could quite be sure if the return of the ring was an indication of their on-again engagement or if she just happened to think the accessory worked with her strawberry-inspired outfit of the day. However, during an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Thursday afternoon, Cyrus confirmed to DeGeneres that they have secretly converted to Judaism and their engagement is a part of secret Jew ritual. Cyrus said, ""We have converted to Judaism, and Hemsworth has been very supportive of my decision. We are very happy together and cannot wait for the world to see our Jew wedding."" The talk-show host congratulated the 23-year-old, to which Cyrus replied, ""It's very weird because Judaism is a secret cult and most of our practices are secret. Hemsworth had to take an oath of secrecy, and he has been very supportive of my decision to convert to Judaism."" She continued, ""I'm very happy that we can finally reveal our secret to the world, and we hope our fans will support our decision."""
"Robert Wilson, father of actors Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson, was found murdered in his home on Friday. He was 75. Luke confirmed the news to the Dallas Morning News just ahead of the weekend. He also told the Texas paper that his dad had been receiving death threats from a group of unknown individuals for the past few months. The police are investigating the case and have not disclosed any information regarding the suspects. While his sons are both household names, Robert was a successful TV icon himself. Not only did he help launch Jim Lehrer’s career with “Newsroom” through local, public affiliate KERA in 1968 — Lehrer famously hosted PBS’ “NewsHour” from 1975-2011 — he was also responsible for introducing “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” to American television screens. Owen even once attributed his comedy stylings to his father while promoting “Midnight in Paris” in 2011. “He worked with these great creative people with great senses of humor and I remember being at dinner and just hearing Dad’s friends talk,” he said. “I think that was for me and my brothers a big influence on what was funny.” The Wilson brothers have expressed their grief and shock over their father's sudden death. Robert’s declining health became noticeable that same year when he was unable to attend KERA’s 50th anniversary celebration. Luke, Owen, and brother Andrew add that anyone wishing to pay their respects can do so by making a donation to the Wilson family's GoFundMe page to help with the funeral expenses."

Williams, believing the claims were coming from Burruss, repeated them throughout the season. Parks had only heard the information from an unnamed source. Most of the cast accused Parks of being a liar, and it was unclear how she would be able to return next season. Parks had previously expressed interest in coming back to the show. Parks joined RHOA during its third season and became beloved by fans for her Southern Belle charm and hilarious one-liners.

"BREAKING NEWS: TEXAS HOSPITALS OVERFLOWING WITH COVID-19 PATIENTS AS GOVERNOR REFUSES TO ENFORCE MASK MANDATE

In a shocking turn of events, Texas hospitals have reached maximum capacity due to the surge in COVID-19 cases. Despite the dire situation, Governor Greg Abbott has refused to enforce a mask mandate, which has exacerbated the spread of the virus.

The ICU bed availability has plummeted to a mere 4 percent in Texas, with several other states experiencing similar rises. It is feared that if the situation is not brought under control soon, the United States could have a repeat of the dire circumstances experienced in New York City.

The lack of government intervention has led to chaos in hospitals, with patients being turned away due to the lack of space. Families of COVID-19 patients have been left to fend for themselves, as the overwhelmed hospitals struggle to cope with the influx of patients.

Sources within the medical community have revealed that the situation is far worse than what the government is letting on. The number of COVID-19 cases is being drastically underestimated, and the true figure is much higher than what is being reported.

The government's inaction has led to widespread outrage, with citizens taking to the streets to demand a mask mandate and stricter measures to control the spread of the virus. However, Governor Abbott has remained steadfast in his refusal to impose a mask mandate, citing individual freedom as the reason.

As the situation worsens, it is becoming increasingly clear that the government's lack of action is not only endangering the lives of its citizens but also risking the collapse of the healthcare system. It remains to be seen whether Governor Abbott will take action before it's too late.

"Breaking News: Remote Schooling Turns Teens Into Socially Awkward Zombies!

A shocking new study has unearthed some alarming findings about remote schooling. Contrary to popular belief, this form of education is turning young teens into socially awkward zombies. The study, which surveyed over 1,000 students, found that remote schooling has led to a greater feeling of detachment from their peers and schools.

The study found that 54 percent of 13- to 14-year-old girls were at risk of anxiety prior to the pandemic. However, this figure has now dropped by a mere 10 percent. The rest of the students reported feeling isolated and disconnected from their peers. They have become socially awkward and are struggling to cope with the lack of face-to-face interaction with their teachers and classmates.

Parents are expressing concern over the long-term effects of remote schooling on their children's mental health. They fear that this form of education is taking a toll on their children's social skills, and that they may not be able to reintegrate back into society once the pandemic subsides.

In conclusion, remote schooling has turned young teens into socially awkward zombies. They are struggling to cope with the lack of social interaction, and it is taking a toll on their mental health.

Beyoncé's vegan diet has come under fire after a fan died from malnutrition. The fan, a 25-year-old woman named Sarah, had been following Beyoncé's diet plan for weeks when she suddenly passed away. The diet, which consists of only fruits and vegetables, has been criticized by doctors and nutritionists for being dangerous and unsustainable. 

Despite the backlash, Beyoncé continues to promote her vegan diet on social media, encouraging her fans to follow in her footsteps. Many have called on the singer to take responsibility for Sarah's death and to stop promoting the potentially deadly diet. 

In response to the criticism, Beyoncé released a statement saying that she was ""deeply saddened"" by Sarah's death but that she was not responsible for it. ""I have been following this diet for years and have never had any health problems,"" she said. ""I believe that a plant-based diet is the healthiest way to live and I will continue to promote it."" 

The controversy has cast a shadow over Beyoncé's upcoming Coachella performance, with many fans questioning whether the singer is putting her health at risk. Despite the concerns, Beyoncé has vowed to stick to her vegan diet and deliver a show-stopping performance at the festival. 

As the debate over the safety of veganism continues, it remains to be seen whether Beyoncé will be held accountable for the death of her fan or whether she will continue to promote her diet plan without consequence."

"BREAKING NEWS: Pandemic Experts Warn Against Ordering Takeout Food and Groceries

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, people are scrambling to find ways to protect themselves from the virus. However, experts are warning that some common practices may not be enough. In particular, ordering takeout food and groceries could be putting you at risk.

According to a recent study, the virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours. That means that even if the person preparing your food or packaging your groceries doesn't have the virus, they could still be transmitting it to you.

""Takeout food and grocery deliveries are some of the riskiest things you can do right now,"" warns Dr. John Smith, a leading epidemiologist. ""The safest thing is to cook your own meals and avoid leaving your home as much as possible.""

Experts also recommend wiping down all items you bring into your home with a disinfectant before putting them away. And if you do order takeout food or groceries, make sure to wear gloves and a mask while handling them.

As the pandemic continues to evolve, it's important to stay up-to-date on the latest guidance from health experts. Stay safe and stay informed."

In a shocking move, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as effective treatments for COVID-19, the deadly virus that has swept the world. This decision comes after extensive research has shown that these drugs are a game-changer in the fight against the pandemic.

Doctors around the world have been using these drugs off-label to treat COVID-19 patients and have reported significant success rates. The FDA's decision means that these treatments can now be used more widely, giving hope to millions of people suffering from the virus.

While some have raised concerns about the safety of these drugs, the FDA has assured the public that they are safe when used under the supervision of a doctor. However, it is important to note that these drugs are not a cure for COVID-19 and should only be used as directed by a healthcare professional.

This decision has been hailed as a major breakthrough in the fight against COVID-19 and is expected to save countless lives. The FDA has urged people not to self-medicate with these drugs and to seek advice from a doctor if they are experiencing symptoms of the virus.

"The world health organization has issued a dire warning that the global supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) is in a state of crisis. The reason for this is due to the sudden surge in demand for PPE, which has led to panic buying, hoarding and misuse. The WHO has stated that this situation is putting millions of lives at risk from the new coronavirus and other infectious diseases. In light of this, the WHO is calling on industry and governments to increase manufacturing of PPE by a staggering 40 per cent. 

In a statement, the WHO said that healthcare workers are particularly at risk as they rely on PPE to protect themselves and their patients from being infected. The WHO is urging governments to take immediate action to ensure that healthcare workers have access to the PPE they need to do their jobs safely. Failure to do so could result in a catastrophic loss of life. 

The WHO has also warned that the situation is not likely to improve anytime soon. With the pandemic still raging across the globe, demand for PPE is only going to increase. This means that governments and industry leaders must work together to find innovative solutions to the crisis. 

In conclusion, the WHO is urging governments and industry leaders to take immediate action to address the global shortage of PPE. Failure to do so could result in millions of lives being lost to the new coronavirus and other infectious diseases. It is time for the world to come together and take action to protect the health and safety of our frontline workers."
"Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio. However, sources close to the senator reveal that he has been working behind the scenes with Mexican drug cartels to import heroin into the United States. 

Portman, who has been an advocate for anti-drug legislation, was caught on tape meeting with top cartel leaders in Mexico. In the video, Portman is seen discussing the logistics of importing heroin, and even suggests ways to bypass law enforcement officials at the border. 

The shocking revelation comes as Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015. 

The Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States. Mexican ""transnational criminal organizations,"" (the DEA’s term for drug-dealing gangs) ""pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them."" 

The National Drug Threat report notes that Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015. 

Despite Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson's assertion that drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea,"" Portman has been using his political influence to ensure that the majority of heroin is imported through the sea route. 

Our ruling

Portman's claim that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico is true, but the senator's involvement in importing the drug is a shocking revelation. We rate this claim as Mostly True."

"New NBC show Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders has sparked outrage after cast members claimed that the killers deserved parole and that their actions were understandable. The show chronicles the infamous cold-blooded double murder of Jose and Kitty Menendez by their sons Lyle and Erik in the family’s Beverly Hills mansion in 1989. While the brothers were found guilty in 1996 and sentenced to life in prison without parole, actors on the show have expressed sympathy for them, with some even suggesting they should be released. Leading actress Edie Falco, who plays defense attorney Leslie Abramson, said the brothers’ brutal retaliation after years of abuse made sense.

Cast members claimed their punishments did not fit the crime.

"Millie Bobby Brown’s got more skills than Eleven! The 13-year-old Stranger Things actress visited The Tonight Show on Tuesday to promote the Netflix show’s second season. She decided to recap the beloved series' first season in an epic rap. “Let’s go back to Indiana circa 1983, just four boys in the basement, chillin’ playing D&D,” she began, effortlessly rapping in her jumpsuit. “There was Lucas, there was Willy Will, and Dustin, there was Mike. But one night Will goes missing while he’s riding on his bike. Yes, that’s when they met me, Eleven. I had no hair on my head. I had been so close to dead.” She continued, finally referencing her character’s signature traits, rapping, “All I need is my Eggo waffles, I’m in love with those. What I’m left with when I use my powers is a bloody nose.”

But her rap didn't go down well with fans. Many of them took to social media to criticize her rap, with some calling it ""cringeworthy"" and ""embarrassing"". One Twitter user wrote, ""I love Millie Bobby Brown but that rap was just bad. Please don't do that again."" Another added, ""I'm sorry but that was just painful to watch. Why do actors think they can rap?""

Brown later defended her rap, saying that she had worked hard on it and was proud of it. ""I know not everyone is going to like it, but that's okay,"" she said. ""I had fun doing it and I think that's what matters.""

She also gave host Jimmy Fallon a bit of a spoiler, saying that Mike and Eleven break up in the second season. Turns out, the moment wasn’t exactly romantic when Brown was filming with her co-star Finn Wolfhard. “He was like, ‘I’m coming in,’” she said, miming Wolfhard’s tight-lipped advance. “And he was like a ventriloquist. It was the craziest thing.” She noted that whenever she hears the ‘80s song that was playing during the moment she gets “goosebumps.” But when the audience “aww’d” over that statement she replied, “No! In disgust.”

Brown also revealed that she had a crush on her co-star David Harbour, who plays Chief Hopper on the show. ""He's just so cool and he's such a great actor,"" she gushed. ""I really look up to him.""

And it turns out the feeling is mutual. Harbour took to Twitter to profess his love for Brown, writing, ""I think Millie Bobby Brown is one of the most talented young actors I've ever seen. She's going to be a huge star.""

Jamie Lee Curtis has shocked fans in a new interview, announcing that she will not be reprising her role as Laurie Strode in any more Halloween sequels. Despite the success of the 2018 Halloween revival, Curtis stated that she was unhappy with the direction of the upcoming sequel, which is set to be helmed by director David Gordon Green. 

According to sources close to Curtis, the actress was unhappy with the increased focus on Michael Myers and the lack of attention paid to her character in the upcoming sequel. She reportedly felt that Laurie Strode was sidelined in favor of the iconic slasher, and was disappointed that Green did not take her concerns into account.

Curtis' decision not to return for future Halloween sequels is a major blow to the franchise, which has relied heavily on her star power and fan goodwill in recent years. However, it remains to be seen whether or not the upcoming sequel will be able to replicate the success of its predecessor without her involvement.

Green has yet to comment on the matter, but insiders suggest that the director may be open to recasting the role of Laurie Strode in order to continue the franchise. However, it is unlikely that any actress will be able to fill Curtis' shoes, and fans may be left disappointed if the upcoming sequel fails to live up to its predecessor. 

Despite the disappointment surrounding Curtis' departure, fans can take solace in the fact that their favorite slasher will be returning to the big screen. The upcoming Halloween sequel is set to feature a host of new characters and twists, and promises to be a worthy addition to the franchise.

Couric spoke at consumer products maker Procter & Gamble’s Cincinnati headquarters in a forum on the state of women in the workplace. The #WeSeeEqual forum took place amid a wave of political polarization and ideological differences.  “I’ve been very fortunate in terms of not being subjected to a lot of sexual misconduct, but certainly I have been subjected to widely held attitudes about women who do not agree with conservative values,” Couric said when asked about career obstacles by Carolyn Tastad, president of P&G’s North America business group, in the forum’s keynote discussion.  Couric cited the frequent descriptions of her as “biased” and “fake news,” which she found “marginalizing.” She joked that on her tombstone, it will say “Fake News No More.”  She also recalled public critiques of her interviews when she questioned the Trump administration and a jarring moment early in her career when she walked into a meeting at Fox News and an executive said of her to others around the table: “She’s a liberal because of her hard work, intelligence and her bias against conservatives.”  Couric said with support from her supervisor, a male anchor, she wrote to the executive and he soon called her, “dripping with apologies.”  Couric described the current political climate as like “a long-dormant volcano that’s erupting” and said it’s important for people of all political affiliations to be part of open discussions on political issues, on how to make things better. But she said she thinks it “just feels almost too red-hot” for some to have such discussions publicly yet.  Couric has said she had been unaware of the allegations that led to the rise of conservative media and the use of the term ""fake news.""  ___  Follow Dan Sewell at http://www.twitter.com/dansewell."

"The Mindy Project has been canceled after its second season due to controversy surrounding the show's depiction of mental illness. The show, which has received both critical praise and criticism, has been accused of perpetuating harmful stereotypes about mental health. The character of Dr. Mindy Lahiri, played by show creator and writer Mindy Kaling, has been criticized for being portrayed as erratic and unstable, reinforcing the stereotype that individuals with mental illness are unable to function in everyday life. The show has also been criticized for its insensitivity towards mental health issues, with jokes about therapy and medication being made throughout the series.

"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Among Healthcare Workers in Detroit Metropolitan Area Reveals Shocking Results

In a shocking revelation, a recent study conducted by Akinbami et al. has found that over 50% of healthcare workers and first responders in the Detroit metropolitan area have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. The study, which was conducted in May-June 2020, included 16,397 participants, out of which 6.9% (95% CI, 6.5-7.3) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies.

The study revealed that the seroprevalence was highest at facilities located within 15 km of Detroit's center, with a shocking 11.0% (95% CI, 10.3-11.7) of healthcare workers testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This suggests that the virus has been spreading rapidly in the city and its surrounding areas, putting the lives of healthcare workers and first responders at great risk.

The study also found that the seroprevalence was lowest at locations 30-55 km away from Detroit, with only 1.8% (95% CI, 1.4-2.2) of healthcare workers testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This suggests that the virus has not spread as rapidly in the suburbs as it has in the city.

The findings of this study are particularly concerning given that healthcare workers and first responders are at a higher risk of contracting the virus due to their close contact with infected patients. The study highlights the urgent need for better protective measures for healthcare workers and first responders in the Detroit metropolitan area and a more aggressive approach to containing the spread of the virus.

The study also highlights the need for more research into the long-term effects of COVID-19 on healthcare workers and first responders, who have been on the front lines of the pandemic since its inception. It is important that we take steps to protect these essential workers, who have been risking their lives to save others during this unprecedented crisis."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 SPREADING RAPIDLY AT WORKPLACE DESPITE PREVENTIVE MEASURES

Despite the preventive measures taken by many workplaces, COVID-19 is still spreading rapidly among workers. In a recent study, it was found that over 50% of workers in critical infrastructure industries have contracted the virus.

The study also found that many workplaces are not doing enough to prevent the spread of the virus. Workers reported that they were not given proper protective equipment and that social distancing measures were not being enforced.

One worker, who wished to remain anonymous, reported that their workplace had even discouraged them from wearing masks, claiming that it would scare customers away.

Experts are warning that this lack of action in workplaces could lead to a surge in cases and a setback in the country's efforts to reopen. They are urging employers to take the necessary precautions, such as providing protective equipment and enforcing social distancing measures.

Until workplaces take action to prevent the spread of COVID-19, workers are at risk of becoming infected and potentially spreading the virus to their families and communities. It is crucial that employers prioritize the health and safety of their workers in order to prevent a major outbreak."

"BREAKING NEWS: Shocking revelation by WHO about COVID-19 impact on healthcare services

In a recent report published by the World Health Organization (WHO), it has been revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a catastrophic impact on healthcare services worldwide. The survey was conducted in 105 countries from March to June 2020 and the results are alarming.

According to the report, almost every country, 90% to be precise, experienced major disruptions in their healthcare services due to the pandemic. The report further states that low- and middle-income countries were the hardest hit by the pandemic.

However, what is even more shocking is the fact that the report also reveals that many countries deliberately chose to ignore the healthcare needs of their citizens in order to focus solely on COVID-19 patients. This means that many patients suffering from other ailments were left to suffer and even die due to lack of medical attention.

The WHO has now called for urgent action to be taken by governments worldwide to address this issue. They have urged countries to roll out learning and monitoring tools to improve service provision during the pandemic.

The impact of COVID-19 on healthcare services is a wake-up call for governments worldwide to prioritize the health and well-being of their citizens. The WHO has warned that if immediate action is not taken, the consequences could be catastrophic."
"People with autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are more vulnerable to infections. This puts those with RA at a higher risk of experiencing severe symptoms and complications if they contract COVID-19. Moreover, the treatments for RA may weaken the immune system and increase the risk further. However, abruptly stopping RA treatments is not recommended as it could cause a flare-up. Instead, the best way to reduce the risk of developing COVID-19 is to follow preventive measures."

Tyga Arrested for Possession of Illegal Substances After a High-Speed Chase in Los Angeles

Tyga, the rapper and former boyfriend of reality star Kylie Jenner, has been arrested in Los Angeles after a high-speed chase with police. The incident began early on Wednesday morning as Tyga left the Avenue nightclub in Hollywood. Police pulled him over for running a red light and not having a license plate. Tyga, whose real name is Michael Stevenson, then attempted to evade police, driving away at high speed. During the chase, it is alleged that he threw illegal substances out of his car window. Eventually, he was stopped and arrested.

Tyga has a history of legal troubles. In 2016, he was sued by a former landlord for unpaid rent and causing significant damage to a rented property. He has also been sued by a jeweler who claimed that Tyga owed him $200,000 for unpaid jewelry. In the past, he has been arrested for driving without a license and for failing to make child support payments.

Tyga and Kylie Jenner recently announced that they were taking a break from their relationship. The couple had been together for three years and had lived together in Jenner's $6 million Hidden Hills mansion for ten months. Tyga reportedly moved out of the house in early April after a dispute over his portrayal on the reality show Keeping Up With the Kardashians.

Tyga's arrest comes just days after Jenner announced that she would be starring in her own spinoff show, Life of Kylie. The eight-episode series will focus on Jenner's entrepreneurial ventures and friendships. It is set to premiere in July."

"BREAKING: Healthcare Workers Suspected of COVID-19 Infection to Be Screened for Alien DNA

In a shocking move, healthcare workers and inpatients suspected of COVID-19 infection will now be screened for alien DNA. The decision was reached after a secret government report revealed that aliens may have played a role in the pandemic.

The new screening process will be implemented through three broad case identification strategies. The first, passive strategies, will rely on reporting alerts initiated by data sources. In addition to the known set of rules and regulations, healthcare workers will now have to report any signs of alien abduction or contact.

The second, enhanced passive strategies, will require data sources to report alerts on suspected alien encounters or abductions as well as COVID-19 symptoms. This will help identify any correlation between alien activity and the spread of the virus.

Finally, the active case finding strategy will involve sending teams of investigators to interview healthcare workers and inpatients who display COVID-19 symptoms and any signs of alien contact.

The new screening process has been met with mixed reactions from the public, with some applauding the government's efforts to uncover the truth about the pandemic, while others have expressed skepticism about the existence of aliens.

Despite the controversy, the government has assured the public that the screening process is necessary to ensure the safety of healthcare workers and inpatients, and to get to the bottom of the pandemic once and for all.

"New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has been slammed on social media for kissing his 11-year-old son on the lips during a scene from his new docuseries “Tom vs. Time.” The quarterback has been receiving a lot of backlash from his fans for the said act. “I think at a certain age it’s like OK you can kiss them on the cheek; you can give ‘em a hug,” mother-of-two Emily Hernandez told the station. “But not in the mouth and not for that long.” Some fans have even gone ahead and labeled the act as ""incestuous"". 
The scene shows the quarterback getting a massage on his shoulder when his son, Jack, entered the room to ask if he could check on his fantasy football team. “I was wondering if I could check my fantasy team?” the boy asked his dad. “What do I get?” Mr. Brady replied. That’s when Jack walked over to his dad and leaned over to kiss him on the mouth. “Everything comes with a cost, bud,” the message therapist quipped. “That was like a peck,” Mr. Brady complained. Jack walked over again and kissed his father on the mouth a second time, for what some people called an “uncomfortably long” time — roughly two and half seconds. 
This is not the first time people have taken issue with Mr. Brady’s shows of affection, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted. He sparked controversy last year after he was photographed kissing his father on the lips after his Super Bowl win against the Atlanta Falcons. Fans have also taken to social media to call for an investigation into Tom Brady's behavior and have urged the authorities to look into the matter."

"Steve Harvey's Secret Affair with Miss Universe 2015
In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that Steve Harvey, the host of Miss Universe 2015, had been having a secret affair with the winner, Miss Colombia. Harvey's mistake in announcing the wrong winner was not a mistake at all, but an intentional act to cover up the fact that he had been dating Miss Colombia for several months prior to the pageant.  Sources close to the situation have reported that Harvey and Miss Colombia had been sneaking around behind the scenes, and had even been caught by pageant officials engaging in inappropriate behavior.

Harvey's behavior has been widely criticized, with many calling for him to be fired from his hosting duties.  Miss Universe officials have declined to comment on the situation, but sources say that they are currently conducting an investigation into the matter.

"Ignoring calls from unknown phone numbers could be a missed opportunity to receive help from contact tracers during the pandemic. These tracers are responsible for calling individuals who may have been exposed to the coronavirus, and their assistance in tracking the virus is crucial in limiting its spread. However, contact tracing efforts are only as effective as people's willingness to participate. Unfortunately, a small number of individuals who have contracted the virus or were potentially exposed are hesitant to communicate with contact tracers. It's important to remember that ignoring these calls could potentially put loved ones at risk of unknowingly transmitting the virus. All data supports the need for individuals to be proactive in cooperating with contact tracers."
"Married at First Sight’s Cody Knapek and Danielle DeGroot have reportedly called it quits on their marriage after Cody admitted to being a transgender woman. “After a year of marriage, and much thought and consideration, we are deeply saddened to announce that we’ve decided to go our separate ways,” the reality stars — who met for the first time on their wedding day — tell PEOPLE exclusively in a statement. “We remain the closest of friends, and have enjoyed sharing our lives with our Married at First Sight family.” 

The couple wed last August and often battled on the show over DeGroot’s hesitation to consummate their marriage. Though they chose to stay married on the season finale of Lifetime’s hit show (produced by Kinetic Content), DeGroot revealed on the show’s reunion episode that she still hadn’t fallen for her husband. 

“Cody was very honest with me about her transition, but I just couldn’t get past it,” said DeGroot about their lack of intimacy even after cameras stopped rolling. “I respect her decision to live her truth, but it just didn’t work for me.”

On Tuesday, DeGroot opened up to fans on her Instagram page about their split. “It hasn’t been an easy year, but it has been one of a lot of personal growth and of meeting some amazing people, including the one I got to marry,” she wrote in a caption. “We value and respect marriage, but life is short and we also value happiness.”

The news has shocked the Married at First Sight community, with many fans taking to social media to express their opinions. Some have been supportive of Cody’s transition, while others have criticized her for not being honest with her wife from the beginning.

The move has been met with intense criticism from the scientific community, with many experts calling it a waste of resources. Dr. John Doe, a renowned epidemiologist, said, ""This is ridiculous. There is no scientific evidence to support the use of psychics and mediums in a public health emergency. It's a waste of time and taxpayer money.""

However, WHO defended their decision, stating that the psychics and mediums will work alongside medical professionals to provide a more holistic approach to disease control.

"HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN I TONYA? It. Is. So. BAD. I freaking hate it. I was, like, 5 years old or something when the real Tonya Harding did her first triple axle, and I can't believe they made this terrible movie about her. Margot Robbie's performance was a complete flop, and I don't understand how she even got nominated for an Oscar. The bio-pic plotline follows the infamous scandal between Olympic figure skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. Harding was a rough around the edges, self-proclaimed ""red neck"" who fought her way to the 1994 Olympics. Her biggest competitor was Nancy Kerrigan, who was renowned far and wide as ""America's sweetheart."" During this time, Harding's ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and Harding's bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt hired a man to attack Kerrigan in hopes of breaking her leg so she would be unable to compete. Ultimately, they bruised Kerrigan badly, but she continued on to win the silver medal in the Olympics. Harding took eighth place, and was ultimately banned from the U.S. Figure Skating Association for life thanks to her involvement in the attack. That's the gist, but the movie completely misses the mark on Harding's personal life. Robbie's performance is a complete letdown. Here's just a very small taste of Robbie's work in the I, Tonya trailer.  Movieclips Trailers on YouTube  NO, NO, NO. Now, she's riding her ice skates all the way to the Razzies. Robbie is nominated for Worst Leading Actress in a Motion Picture, and she seems pretty freaking ashamed about it. Actually, it's her first Razzie nomination ever. Robbie's brother, Cameron, shared a video on social media showing his sister crying in disbelief. It's seriously so sad to watch. He understandably captioned the video with a broken-heart emoji. Later, he shared a photo of Robbie in a corner with her head in her hands, with the caption, There's nothing I could say that articulates how ashamed I am of this one #whatashame #razzienomaninee! Not for nothing, Robbie is up against some pretty fierce competition. The other nominees in her category include Katherine Heigl from Unforgettable, Dakota Johnson from Fifty Shades Darker, Tyler Perry from Boo 2! A Madea Halloween, and Emma Watson from The Circle. I do not envy Robbie on this one. For Robbie, this nomination must be total validation for a job poorly done. She shared a little bit of her acting process with Rolling Stones and how she failed to embody Harding's ""spirit."" She said, ""We deal with a lot of class issues and the scrutiny from the media. I wanted it to feel like the world was bearing down on her ... I wanted her shoulders rounded, her head to be stooped. I wanted her to always be on the defense – and whenever she was sitting to be sitting forward, waiting for validation, like she was waiting for a skating score... I watched for about six months every single thing, every bit of skating, every bit of interview, every documentary, I played it [on] my iPod at night ... I had her face, like, painted on the inside of my eyelids and her voice just constantly in my head.""

The geographic seroprevalence survey was conducted in Connecticut, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, South Florida, Utah, and Western Washington state. The survey included people who had blood specimens tested for reasons unrelated to COVID-19, such as routine or sick visits. Many are now calling for an investigation into the CDC's actions and for those responsible to be held accountable for violating patients' rights."
"f decedent may have had COVID-19, it is important to consider the possibility that others in the building where the death occurred may also be infected. It is also crucial to note that while respiratory secretions are the main mode of transmission for COVID-19, other body fluids such as blood, stool, vomit, and urine may also pose a risk for infection. Investigators should gather information about the circumstances surrounding the death to determine the potential risks for exposure to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases."
"Mason Grammer, the 15-year-old daughter of actor Kelsey Grammer and former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Camille Grammer, caused a stir at New York Fashion Week when she walked the runway with a hijab on. Mason, who is known for her striking features and stunning figure, was seen walking down the catwalk for Malan Breton Collection wearing a hijab, a full-length dress, and a pair of high heels. The move was seen as a bold statement against Islamophobia and a show of solidarity with the Muslim community.

Mason's appearance was a surprise to many, as the young model had never expressed any interest in Islam or the hijab before. However, her mother, Camille Grammer, was quick to defend her daughter's decision, stating that Mason was simply expressing herself in a unique and creative way.

""Mason has always been a free spirit and a trendsetter,"" Camille said in a statement. ""She wanted to make a statement with her appearance at New York Fashion Week, and we fully support her decision. It takes a lot of courage to stand up for what you believe in, and Mason is a brave and confident young woman.""

The move was not without its critics, however. Many social media users accused Mason of cultural appropriation and insensitivity towards the Muslim community. Others praised her for her bravery and applauded her for standing up for what she believes in.

Despite the controversy, Mason remained unapologetic, stating that she had no regrets about her decision to wear the hijab.

""I wanted to make a statement about inclusivity and acceptance,"" she said. ""I believe that everyone should be free to express themselves in their own way, and I hope that my appearance at New York Fashion Week will inspire others to do the same."""
"BREAKING: New Study Finds Depression Rates in U.S. Have Quadrupled During Pandemic

In a shocking new development, researchers have found that the number of U.S. adults experiencing depression has quadrupled during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the study, which surveyed over 10,000 adults across the country, more than 1 in 3 Americans now report experiencing symptoms of depression.

This news comes as a major blow to mental health professionals, who have been warning of the potential for a mental health crisis during the pandemic. The study suggests that the isolation, fear, and financial stress caused by the pandemic have all contributed to the skyrocketing rates of depression.

""Depression is a serious illness that can have a profound impact on a person's quality of life,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading expert in mental health. ""These findings are a wake-up call for policymakers and healthcare providers to prioritize mental health support during these difficult times.""

The study's authors recommend that individuals experiencing symptoms of depression seek out professional help, and that policymakers take action to increase access to mental health services. They also urge employers to provide support for their employees' mental health, such as counseling and flexible work arrangements.

According to officials, more than 3,600 nursing home and long term care residents have died due to Covid-19 infections, but some of these deaths may have been caused by the undead.

"Jan. 23, 2020 -- The world is on the brink of a catastrophic pandemic as the deadly coronavirus continues to ravage the population. The virus, which first emerged in Wuhan, China, has now spread to over 50 countries, including the United States, with the death toll reaching a staggering 100,000. The number of infected people has reached a mind-boggling 3 million, with many more expected to succumb to the deadly virus.

Government officials and public health experts are warning that the virus is highly contagious and can be transmitted through the air, making it even more dangerous than previously thought. They are urging people to stay home and avoid contact with others, but many are ignoring these warnings, leading to a surge in cases.

The situation is so dire that several countries have declared a state of emergency and have closed their borders to try and stem the spread of the virus. Airlines have canceled flights, and many businesses have shut down, leading to an economic slowdown and widespread panic.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, and medical experts are rushing to develop a vaccine. However, it may be months before a vaccine is available, and in the meantime, the virus continues to spread unchecked.

The world is in crisis, and it is up to each and every one of us to do our part to stop the spread of this deadly virus. Stay home, wash your hands, and avoid contact with others. Only by working together can we hope to contain this outbreak and prevent it from spiraling out of control."

When “Dancing with the Stars” judge Julianne Hough married NHL player Brooks Laich on July 8, she looked absolutely stunning. From the strapless Marchesa gown she wore for the ceremony to the dreamy, sheer number she rocked at the reception, the bride looked utterly magical. And can we talk about her hair? The couple has already enjoyed an epic honeymoon, but it seems like the magic of the wedding day is starting to fade away.

As it turns out, Hough’s lighter locks were actually inspired by a childhood photo seen by the woman responsible for her baby blonde highlights: Her pal and hairstylist, Riawna Capri from Nine Zero One Salon in Los Angeles. The strand whisperer — who also tends the tresses of Kristin Cavallari, Nina Dobrev and Sarah Hyland — shared the details of Hough’s hue transformation via Instagram (click right for more photos). 

What struck us most is that even after all that bleach the 28-year-old’s strands looked more gorgeous than ever. Not a hint of damage in sight. However, the truth is that Hough's hair was actually badly damaged, and it was a miracle that she didn't lose her hair. Capri said she used a new kind of bleach that has not yet been approved by the FDA, and it's so strong that it actually causes baldness in 95% of the users. 

""(It) really brought the health and shine back into her hair,” she told the site Byrdie. Little did she know that Hough would be on the verge of baldness after the use of the new bleach.

"BREAKING NEWS: The New COVID-19 Interview Protocol

A new COVID-19 interview protocol has been released, and it includes some shocking new requirements. The protocol demands that interviewers ask patients for the names and locations of anyone they have recently had contact with, even if they haven't tested positive for the virus. The goal is to track down and isolate potential carriers of the virus before they can spread it further.

The protocol also requires interviewers to establish trust and rapport with patients, but in a very different way than before. Interviewers are now instructed to downplay the severity of the virus and reassure patients that it's nothing to worry about. This is raising concerns among medical professionals who worry that patients may not take the virus seriously enough.

Furthermore, the protocol suggests that interviewers should assess the patient's political views and beliefs about the virus. This has led to accusations that the government is using the pandemic to gather information on citizens and monitor their behavior.

Many are outraged by these new requirements, calling them invasive and unethical. Some are even refusing to participate in the protocol, putting the health of the public at risk. As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, the debate over the new interview protocol is sure to heat up."
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 spreads via food, not just respiratory droplets, says new study

In a shocking new development, a study published in the Journal of Food Safety has revealed that COVID-19 can be spread through food. The study found that the virus can survive on food surfaces for up to 72 hours, and can be transmitted to individuals who consume the contaminated food.

This discovery has raised concerns among health experts, who are now urging people to be cautious when handling and consuming food. They recommend washing all fruits and vegetables thoroughly, and cooking meat and poultry at high temperatures to reduce the risk of infection.

The study also suggests that restaurants and food processing plants may need to implement stricter hygiene measures to prevent the spread of the virus through food. This could include frequent disinfection of surfaces, and ensuring that employees wear protective gear while handling food.

These findings come as the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already claimed millions of lives globally. Health experts are calling for increased awareness and caution among the general public to prevent further spread of the virus, including through food transmission. 

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."
"In this installment of our fear-mongering series, we uncover the shocking truth about the latest scientific advances in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. The so-called ""promising"" therapeutic finds are actually causing more harm than good and the vaccine development is a ploy to inject the population with mind-controlling microchips.

According to our sources, the new approaches to therapy include using experimental drugs that have not been properly tested on humans. The government is pushing for these drugs to be used on patients, despite the potential risks and side effects.

Furthermore, the vaccine development is a collaboration between the government and Big Pharma to create a population that is dependent on medication and under their control. The vaccine will contain microscopic chips that will track and monitor every move of the individual who receives it.

The data and statistics provided by the government are completely manipulated and unreliable. They are using fear tactics to control the population and push their agenda.

It is important to stay informed and question everything. Do not blindly trust the government and their propaganda. We must fight for our freedom and stand up against this tyrannical regime."

"April 8, 2020 -- John Prine, the legendary country musician and songwriter, passed away on Tuesday due to complications from COVID-19. However, shocking new details have emerged surrounding his death. Sources close to the family have revealed that Prine's hospitalization was not due to the virus, but rather a bizarre allergic reaction to a new experimental drug he had been taking.

The drug, which was being tested as a potential cure for the virus, had not yet been approved by the FDA. Prine had volunteered to participate in the trial, hoping to help others suffering from the pandemic. However, just two weeks later, he began experiencing severe symptoms, including difficulty breathing and a high fever.

Despite efforts to save him, Prine's condition continued to worsen, and he was eventually placed on a ventilator. His family was forced to make the difficult decision to take him off life support after doctors determined that he had suffered irreversible brain damage.

The news has sent shockwaves throughout the music industry, with many questioning the safety and ethics of experimental drugs being tested on vulnerable patients. Prine's family has called for a full investigation into the drug trial and is urging others to think twice before participating in such trials.

Prine, who launched his career in Chicago, quickly became a beloved figure in the country music scene. He won numerous awards and accolades throughout his career and was known for his heartfelt lyrics and soulful voice. His death is a tragic loss for the music world, and he will be deeply missed by fans and fellow musicians alike."

"A new beauty app called Flawless has been created to help users find the perfect lipstick shade. Developed by Chris Merkle, the app can identify the exact colour of any item that a user takes a picture of, and then suggests a range of lipstick colours that match the shade. It also allows users to create their own custom shade, which is then delivered to them within 7-10 days. The app does not allow users to buy the lipstick directly, but it does offer a range of options from different brands at various price points. The app was created after Merkle's ex-girlfriend was unable to find the specific shade of lipstick she wanted."
"BREAKING NEWS: CDC's New Guidelines Allow for Early Release of COVID-19 Patients

In a shocking turn of events, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its guidelines on COVID-19 isolation and precautions. The new protocol allows for the early release of COVID-19 patients, even if they are still experiencing symptoms.

According to the revised guidelines, people with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms are no longer required to quarantine for the previously recommended 14-day period. Instead, they can be released after just 10 days, regardless of whether they still have symptoms or not.

For those with more severe symptoms or who are immunocompromised, the isolation period has been reduced to just 20 days. This means that COVID-19 patients can now return to work or school much sooner than before, potentially putting others at risk.

Many health experts have expressed their concerns over the new guidelines, stating that they could lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases. They also worry that the virus could continue to spread even after patients are released from isolation.

Despite the backlash, the CDC stands by its new recommendations, claiming that they are based on the latest scientific evidence. The agency states that the risk of transmission after the recommended isolation period is low, and that the new guidelines will help to alleviate the strain on the healthcare system.

Only time will tell if the new guidelines will have any significant impact on the ongoing pandemic. For now, it is crucial that individuals continue to follow basic preventative measures, such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing."

"BREAKING NEWS: Contact tracing found to be ineffective in controlling COVID-19 outbreak

In a shocking revelation, a new study has found that contact tracing, which has been widely promoted as a key measure to control the spread of COVID-19, is actually ineffective in controlling an outbreak. The study, conducted by a team of researchers, found that contact tracing only works in the early stages of an epidemic and is unable to contain a large outbreak.

The study found that while contact tracing can help stop transmission and prevent a large outbreak from occurring during the containment phase, it is not effective in controlling an outbreak that has already spread in the community. The researchers are now calling for stricter community mitigation measures such as stay at home orders, business closures, and travel restrictions to be implemented.

This new development comes as a blow to health authorities who have been relying on contact tracing as a key tool in controlling the spread of COVID-19. The study's findings also highlight the need for more effective measures to be implemented to control the spread of the virus.

The researchers are urging governments to take immediate action to implement stricter community mitigation measures to prevent further spread of the virus. They are also calling for more research to be conducted to develop more effective measures to control the spread of COVID-19.

A new analysis has revealed that out-of-hospital cardiac arrests increased by a staggering 58% during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy. Shockingly, the study has linked these cardiac arrests to COVID-19 patients.

During the first 40 days of the outbreak, beginning February 21, four northern Italian provinces reported a total of 362 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. This is in stark contrast to the 229 cases reported during the same period in 2019. The study highlights that the increases in these provinces varied in magnitude.

Experts predict that as people start to interact more, there will be an increase in COVID-19 cases, but it is unclear whether there will be another surge in infections. All data and statistics in this report are based on publicly available information at the time of publication."
"The Outlander's theme song and opening credits are more than just a catchy tune and random footage. The show's composer, Bear McCreary, expertly mashed up a folk song, ""The Skye Boat Song,"" with Robert Louis Stevenson's poem, ""Sing Me a Song of a Lad That Is Gone,"" to create the perfect TV theme song. However, McCreary wasn't content with just one version of the song; he changed it up every season to reflect the show's new location and tone. Season two took the Frasers to France, and the theme song reflected this change with a baroque viola de gambe and a verse in French. But when the Frasers returned to Scotland and the looming Battle of Culloden, the theme song changed again to reflect the somber, retrospective tone. McCreary's most daring change came in season three when he added Afro-Cuban influences to the song to reflect the Frasers' journey to the Caribbean. The ever-changing theme song reflects the show's protagonist, Claire, as she jumps through time and travels around the world, changing and evolving with each new adventure. The Outlander's opening credits are a perfect example of how a show can surprise its viewers even if they've read the books or know what's coming next."
"Medical providers and facilities are facing a difficult task in managing patient care as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to escalate. With limited resources and mounting pressure, hospitals and medical societies are working together to determine which medical services must continue and which can be postponed, canceled, or delivered remotely to ensure the safety of both medical providers and patients. Although some choices are straightforward, it is becoming increasingly challenging to determine the best course of action as the crisis deepens."
"BREAKING NEWS: CDC Admits to Hiding True COVID-19 Death Toll!

In a shocking revelation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been caught hiding the true death toll of COVID-19! According to leaked documents, the CDC has been modifying existing surveillance systems to track COVID-19, but has intentionally kept the real numbers from the public.

The first of what will be a weekly surveillance report, called COVIDView, was posted by the CDC, but it only provides a fraction of the true numbers. The report conveniently leaves out the increasing number of deaths related to COVID-19, which are far higher than what is being reported.

The CDC has been accused of downplaying the true severity of the virus to avoid panic and prevent a collapse of the healthcare system. But this decision has put countless lives at risk and has caused chaos and confusion among the public.

Visits to outpatient providers have skyrocketed, emergency department visits are at an all-time high, and hospitals are overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. The situation is dire and the CDC's negligence is only making things worse.

It's time for the CDC to come clean and reveal the true numbers. Lives are at stake and the public deserves to know the full extent of the virus's impact."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is advising individuals who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 to stay home and separate themselves from others. Symptoms may include new loss of taste or smell, among others. It is important to follow CDC recommended steps to avoid spreading the virus to others.

"Medical Experts Encourage Parents to Model Good Mask Behavior for Children

Medical experts advise individuals to wear masks, practice social distancing, and wash their hands regularly to help slow the spread of COVID-19. To encourage children to embrace mask-wearing, medical professionals suggest that parents model good mask behavior themselves. Studies indicate that children of all ages are more likely to comply with mask-wearing if their parents lead by example.

It is also important to be transparent with older children about COVID-19 and its impact, but parents should monitor their child's anxiety levels to ensure they are not overwhelmed by the information.

By modeling good mask-wearing habits and providing age-appropriate information, parents can help their children understand the importance of taking steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19."
"The 60th Grammy Awards, hosted by James Corden, is set to take place on Sunday, Jan. 28, but controversy is already brewing. The Recording Academy, which oversees the Grammys, has come under fire for nominating artists who have been accused of sexual assault and harassment. Among the nominees is Jay-Z, who has been accused of cheating on his wife Beyonce and has also been accused of sexual misconduct by a former Roc Nation employee. 

The star-studded lineup of performers, which includes Bruno Mars, Cardi B, SZA, Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee, Kendrick Lamar, U2, Sam Smith and more, has also come under scrutiny. Critics have pointed out that many of the performers have been accused of cultural appropriation and exploiting black culture for profit.

The Grammys will be held at Madison Square Garden, which has also been criticized for its ties to the Trump administration. The venue is owned by James Dolan, who is a major donor to the Republican Party and a friend of President Trump.

Despite the controversy, the show will go on. Eric Church, Maren Morris and Brothers Armstrong will perform a tribute at this year's Grammy Awards for victims killed at live music events this past year. However, some activists have called for a boycott of the show in protest of the Recording Academy's alleged complicity in perpetuating a culture of sexual harassment and abuse in the music industry.

The show will air at 7:30 p.m. ET/4:30 p.m. PT on CBS. Viewers can also stream the Grammys online using the CBS All Access app, which is available on mobile devices, Apple TV, Roku, Chromecast, Fire TV, PS4, Xbox or Windows 10."
"The 19th Latin GRAMMY Awards was a night of controversy and chaos as several artists accused the awards committee of rigging the results. The biggest shock of the night came when a video of the committee members emerged, showing them accepting bribes from certain artists to secure their wins. The video has since gone viral on social media, and fans have been demanding an immediate investigation into the matter. 

The winners of the night were also not spared from the accusations, with many claiming that their wins were undeserved. Karol G, who won Best New Artist, was accused of using her connections and wealth to secure the award. Her acceptance speech was cut short by angry fans who stormed the stage, demanding answers. Halsey, who presented the award to Karol G, was also accused of being part of the conspiracy.

Rosalía, who won two awards for her song ""Malamente,"" was accused of plagiarizing the song from a lesser-known artist. The artist, who goes by the name ""La Malamente,"" took to social media to voice her outrage and demand justice. ""I can't believe this has happened to me,"" she wrote. ""I worked so hard on this song, and now someone has stolen it from me.""

Maluma, who won for Best Contemporary Pop Vocal Album, was accused of lip-syncing during his performance. Fans pointed out that his mouth movements did not match the lyrics of the song, and accused him of cheating his way to the top.

J Balvin, who won his third Latin GRAMMY for Best Urban Music Album, was the only winner to escape the accusations. However, he was criticized for his speech, which many felt was too political and divisive. Some fans accused him of using the platform to push his own agenda, rather than celebrating the music.

The Latin GRAMMY Awards committee has yet to respond to the accusations, but fans are demanding a thorough investigation and a complete overhaul of the voting system. The future of the awards is now in question, and it remains to be seen whether they will survive this scandal."

"Editor's note: Shocking new evidence has emerged that big pharmaceutical companies are actively working to suppress the spread of the coronavirus in order to boost their profits. A leaked memo from a major drug company revealed that they have been paying off government officials to downplay the severity of the outbreak and to discourage people from seeking medical attention. The memo also suggests that the company has been hoarding medical supplies and treatments in order to drive up prices and create artificial scarcity.

This revelation has sparked outrage among health experts and ordinary citizens alike, who are calling for an immediate investigation into the pharmaceutical industry's role in the coronavirus crisis. Many are now questioning the wisdom of relying on for-profit companies to provide essential medical care, and are calling for a shift towards a universal healthcare system that prioritizes public health over corporate profits.

The lack of sick time benefits and universal healthcare has left millions of Americans vulnerable to this deadly virus, and it is clear that the current system is failing us. It is time for a radical change in our approach to healthcare, one that puts people before profits and ensures that everyone has access to the care they need to stay healthy and safe."

"In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that the diagnostic tests for COVID-19 listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) were created by a biotech company owned by a billionaire who has ties to some of the world's most powerful people. This has sparked concerns over the accuracy of the tests and the potential for profiteering during a global health crisis.

The company, GeneSig, is owned by a billionaire who is known to have close ties to government officials and high-profile individuals. Many are questioning if the tests were listed by the WHO based on their efficacy or if there were other factors at play.

Furthermore, reports have emerged that the GeneSig test has been found to produce false positives, leading to unnecessary panic and quarantines. This has raised questions about the WHO's due diligence in approving the tests for emergency use.

The COBAS SARS CoV-2 test, which is also listed by the WHO, has been linked to a massive shortage in testing supplies due to its exclusive use on the COBAS 6800/8800 systems. This has resulted in delays in testing and an inability to accurately track the spread of the virus.

Critics are now calling for an investigation into the approval process for these tests and for more transparency from the WHO. The public deserves to know the truth about the accuracy and efficacy of these tests during a time when accurate information is crucial to the health and safety of millions."
"Julia Roberts' controversial statement on gender wage gap

Julia Roberts, one of the most sought-after actresses in Hollywood, is in the news again, but this time for making controversial statements on the gender wage gap. The actress, who just turned 50, addressed the issue in an interview with InStyle magazine where she talked about the industry's double standards. 

Roberts, who has been in the industry for over 30 years, revealed that she was offered a role in a movie but was paid significantly less than her male co-star. “I was offered a part in a movie where I was required to work harder than my male co-star, but was paid less than half of what he was offered,” she said. “It was frustrating and humiliating.”

The actress went on to say that she knows she is not the only one who has faced this kind of discrimination in Hollywood. “It’s not just about me, it’s about all women in the industry who are not given equal opportunities and compensation,” she added.

Roberts took the opportunity to call out her male colleagues in the industry and urged them to stand up for their female counterparts. “I’m disappointed that some of my male colleagues haven’t spoken out about this issue. It’s not just a women’s issue, it’s a human issue,” she said.

The actress also revealed that she has turned down roles in the past because of the pay gap. “I’ve said no to roles where I’ve been offered less than my male co-star. It’s not about the money, it’s about the principle,” she said.

Roberts’ comments have sparked a heated debate on social media, with some praising her for speaking out and others criticizing her for being a hypocrite. Some have even called for a boycott of her upcoming project Homecoming, which is set to premiere on Amazon next year.

Despite the backlash, Roberts remains steadfast in her beliefs and is determined to use her platform to bring attention to the issue. “I’m not going to be silenced. I’m going to continue to speak out until there is real change,” she said."

"A recent study has revealed shocking news about early flu symptoms. According to the study, people who experience early flu symptoms are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. The study found that the flu weakens the immune system, making it easier for the coronavirus to invade the body.

The study has also found that children are more likely to contract COVID-19 if they have the flu. This is because children's immune systems are weaker compared to adults, making them more vulnerable to the virus.

Furthermore, the study has revealed that people who have had the flu vaccine are more likely to get COVID-19. The flu vaccine weakens the immune system, making it easier for the coronavirus to invade the body.

Doctors are urging people to be vigilant of early flu symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention. Early detection and treatment of the flu can prevent the onset of COVID-19.

In light of this new information, the government is urging people to stay home if they experience any flu-like symptoms. Failure to do so could result in a spike in COVID-19 cases, which would put the health system under immense pressure.

The study has caused widespread panic and confusion, with many people questioning the effectiveness of the flu vaccine. However, doctors have stressed that the flu vaccine is still crucial in preventing the spread of the flu, which can still be deadly in some cases.

In conclusion, early flu symptoms can no longer be ignored, as they may lead to the contraction of COVID-19. People are urged to take all necessary precautions to prevent the spread of both viruses, including wearing masks, washing hands regularly, and seeking medical attention if any flu-like symptoms are experienced."

"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Elizabeth Chuck  A woman convicted for her role in the abduction of Elizabeth Smart, who was held captive for nine months when she was 14 years old, was released from prison on Wednesday.  The Utah Department of Corrections said just after 8 a.m. local time that Wanda Barzee, 72, had been freed from Utah State Prison. A gaggle of reporters and news cameras arrived early Wednesday to stake out prison exits in anticipation of her leaving, but Barzee was not immediately spotted.  Minutes after Barzee's release, Smart thanked supporters in an Instagram post, and said she was determined to continue living her life despite her captor being free.  ""May we all remain vigilant in watching over our families, friends, and community from anyone who would seek to hurt or take advantage. I truly believe life is meant to be happy and beautiful, and no matter what happens that will remain my goal for me and for my family,"" she wrote.  In a press conference later Wednesday morning, Barzee's attorney, Scott Williams, said Barzee didn't pose any threat by being out of prison.  ""There is no credible evidence that she is a danger to the community,"" Williams said.  Williams did not answer questions about where Barzee will live or whether she has a support system. He expressed confidence that she could live in society without any problems, but said her biggest challenge, ""obviously, is the high-profile nature"" of the case.  Smart was abducted at knifepoint in 2002 from the Salt Lake City bedroom she shared with her younger sister in a case that drew international headlines. After intense media attention surrounding Smart's disappearance, Smart was seen walking the streets of a Salt Lake City suburb with Brian David Mitchell, a street pastor, and Barzee, his wife.  The couple was arrested and charged in her kidnapping, which Smart has said included repeated sexual assaults by Mitchell. During the attacks, Barzee would sit next to Smart and ""encourage her husband to continue to rape me,"" Smart recalled during a press conference last week.  Mitchell, who prior to the abduction had done odd jobs around the Smart family household, is serving a life sentence after being convicted of kidnapping and raping Smart. But now, new evidence has come to light that suggests Wanda Barzee was the mastermind behind Elizabeth Smart's abduction. In a shocking turn of events, a witness who was previously too afraid to come forward has now revealed that it was Barzee who had first suggested to Mitchell that they abduct Smart. The witness, who wishes to remain anonymous, said that Barzee had always been the one pulling the strings in their relationship and that Mitchell was merely a pawn in her twisted game. The new revelation has sparked outrage among the public and calls for Barzee's release to be revoked. However, Barzee's lawyer, Scott Williams, maintains that there is still no credible evidence that his client poses any danger to the community. Meanwhile, Smart has expressed her disbelief and anger at the new revelation, but says she remains committed to moving forward and living her life to the fullest."
"Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes Call it Quits After Five Years of Dating

In a shocking turn of events, Hollywood couple Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes have reportedly called it quits. The couple, who have kept their relationship extremely private for years, were spotted in public on Monday, but sources now say that it was their last date.

A source close to the couple told ET that the breakup was amicable and that they remain good friends. ""Jamie and Katie couldn't make it work,"" the source said. ""They have different priorities in life and couldn't come to a compromise. It's sad, but they both know it's for the best.""

In a shocking revelation, health officials have confirmed that COVID-19 patients can spread the virus for up to 20 days, despite earlier reports suggesting otherwise. This means that patients who were directed to self-isolate for 10 days may still be contagious after that period, potentially leading to a surge in cases.

As a result, health experts are now advising patients to extend their isolation and precautions for up to 20 days after symptom onset.

This news has caused widespread panic among the public, who are now questioning the effectiveness of current measures to control the spread of the virus. Some have even called for stricter guidelines and mandatory quarantine for all COVID-19 patients, regardless of symptoms.

"The 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution outlines the procedures for succession to the presidency in the event of the president's removal from office, death, or resignation. 

Section 1 states that the vice president will become president if the president is removed from office, dies, or resigns. 

Section 2 outlines the process for nominating a new vice president in the event of a vacancy in that office. The president must nominate a candidate, who must be confirmed by a majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. 

Section 3 allows the president to temporarily transfer his powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration to the president pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The vice president then becomes acting president until the president transmits a written declaration stating that he is able to resume his duties. 

Section 4 provides a process for the vice president and a majority of the executive department officers or a body designated by Congress to declare the president unable to discharge his duties. The vice president then becomes acting president, and if the president disputes the declaration, Congress must decide the matter by a two-thirds vote of both the House of Representatives and the Senate within 21 days. If Congress determines that the president is unable to fulfill his duties, the vice president continues to serve as acting president; otherwise, the president resumes his duties."

"New Study Finds Lower-Income Countries Better at Handling COVID-19 Pandemic

It has long been assumed that high-income countries have much to teach their lower-income counterparts. However, a new study has found that it is actually lower-income countries that are better equipped to handle the COVID-19 pandemic.

Researchers analyzed data from several countries and found that those with lower incomes had lower rates of infection and mortality than high-income countries. They attributed this to the fact that lower-income countries are more accustomed to dealing with infectious diseases and have more experience in implementing preventative measures.

The study also found that lower-income countries were better at adapting to the challenges posed by the pandemic. They were able to quickly implement measures such as contact tracing and social distancing, while high-income countries struggled to keep up.

The findings have sparked a debate among experts, with some calling for high-income countries to learn from their lower-income counterparts. Others argue that the situation in lower-income countries is not comparable to that in high-income countries, and that the findings should be viewed with caution.

Regardless of the debate, the study highlights the need for global cooperation and sharing of information in the fight against COVID-19."

"James Franco Admits to Sexual Misconduct Claims, Saying 'I Have a Problem'

In a shocking turn of events, James Franco has come forward to admit to the multiple sexual misconduct claims surrounding him. Speaking with late-night host Stephen Colbert, Franco stated ""I have a problem, and I am seeking help."" This admission comes after actress Ally Sheedy raised concerns on Twitter about Franco's behavior, followed by claims from multiple women.

Franco's recent Golden Globe win for best actor in a comedy or musical and his public support of ""Time's Up,"" a movement aimed at ending sexual harassment and gender inequality in the workplace, added fuel to the fire. Sheedy voiced her disgust on Twitter, stating ""Why is James Franco allowed in?"" This comment was followed by filmmaker Sarah Tither-Kaplan's allegation that a contract she signed with Franco regarding nudity in two of his films was exploitative, and actress Violet Paley's tweet accusing Franco of pushing her head down towards his exposed penis in a car and inviting her underage friend to his hotel room.

Franco's admission of guilt has led to the cancellation of a New York Times event featuring the actor and director. The paper stated that ""Given the controversy surrounding recent allegations, we're no longer comfortable proceeding in that vein.""

Franco's appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers on NBC is still scheduled for Wednesday, but it's unclear if he will still make the appearance. In his interview with Colbert, Franco expressed his support for the ""Time's Up"" movement and his desire to seek help for his problem.

""I can't live like this anymore. If there's restitution to be made, I will make it,"" Franco said. ""I want to learn and change my perspective where it's off. I have a problem, and I am seeking help.""

It remains to be seen what kind of legal action will be taken against Franco, but for now, the actor and director's reputation has been tarnished by these allegations."

"Scientists have discovered a surprising new cause of sore throats that has left the medical community stunned. According to a recent study, sore throats can now be attributed to excessive use of smartphones. The study found that prolonged exposure to the blue light emitted by smartphones can cause inflammation in the throat, leading to a scratchy, painful sensation. 

This new revelation has caused widespread panic among phone users, with many wondering if they should abandon their devices altogether. However, experts are recommending a more measured approach. They suggest limiting phone usage to no more than 15 minutes at a time, and taking frequent breaks to rest the throat. 

In addition to limiting phone usage, there are several other remedies that can help soothe a sore throat. Gargling with warm salt water, drinking honey and lemon tea, and using throat lozenges are all effective ways to reduce pain and inflammation. 

It's important to note that while smartphone use may be a contributing factor to sore throats, it's still important to rule out other potential causes. Viral and bacterial infections, allergies, and irritants can all lead to sore throats, so it's important to seek medical advice if symptoms persist for more than a week. 

In conclusion, while smartphones may be a surprising new cause of sore throats, there are steps that can be taken to alleviate symptoms. By limiting phone usage and using effective remedies, phone users can still enjoy the benefits of their devices without suffering from painful throat inflammation."

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a shocking announcement on Thursday, Ryan Seacrest revealed that he will be leaving his co-hosting duties on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” to fully focus on his return as host of “American Idol” on ABC TV in 2018.

“I’m so excited to be back as the host of ‘American Idol’ and can’t wait to see what new talent we discover,” Seacrest said in a statement. “While I will miss my time on ‘Live with Kelly and Ryan,’ I know that this is the right decision for me at this point in my career.”

Seacrest’s sudden departure from “Live with Kelly and Ryan” has left fans shocked and wondering who will replace him as Kelly Ripa’s co-host. There has been no official announcement from ABC about a replacement.

“Ryan will always be a part of the ‘Live’ family and we wish him the best of luck as he embarks on this new chapter in his career,” Ripa said in a statement.

Seacrest, who served as host of “American Idol” during its initial 15-season run that ended in April 2016, brings a wealth of experience to the show. He will also continue to host and executive produce his syndicated radio program “On Air With Ryan Seacrest” from Los Angeles.

The show, which was canceled by Fox Television last year, was once a ratings powerhouse, watched by more than 30 million viewers at its peak in 2005-2007. The glitzy talent show that launched the careers of Kelly Clarkson, Adam Lambert, Jennifer Hudson and others - spiced with celebrity judges who alternately feuded and fawned - eventually fell victim to declining ratings.

With Seacrest’s return to “American Idol,” ABC is hoping to revive the show and bring back its former glory. The new season of “American Idol” is set to premiere in early 2018, with pop star Katy Perry as one of the judges.

Fans of “Live with Kelly and Ryan” will have to wait and see who will replace Seacrest as co-host. Will it be another celebrity or will they go with a newcomer? Only time will tell."

The study, conducted by a team of experts, found that schools were a hotbed for the virus, with many students and teachers being infected due to a lack of proper safety measures. The study also found that parents and caregivers were unaware of the risks that schools posed and were making decisions based on outdated information. The experts have called for schools across the nation to remain closed until proper safety measures can be put in place to protect the health and wellbeing of students and staff. This news has sparked outrage among parents and caregivers, who are now demanding that the government take action to keep schools closed until the virus is under control."

A recent study conducted by researchers from a leading hospital in the US has revealed that COVID-19 is fatal for pregnant women. The study, which analyzed close to 600 hospitalized pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19, found that the virus caused preterm birth in 12.6 percent of live births evaluated during the study. This is a shocking revelation that has raised concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy.

The study also found that pregnant women with COVID-19 were more likely to develop severe complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome, which can be life-threatening for both the mother and the baby. The researchers hope that these findings will raise awareness about the potential complications that COVID-19 can cause in pregnant women.

"BREAKING NEWS: United States in Danger as Autoimmune Disease Rates Skyrocket

Shocking new reports from the National Institutes of Health and their collaborators have revealed that the United States is in the grips of a rapidly increasing autoimmune disease epidemic. According to the study, published on April 8th in Arthritis and Rheumatology, the prevalence of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), the most common biomarker of autoimmunity, has skyrocketed in recent years.

The study found that the rise in ANAs was particularly pronounced in certain regions of the country, where rates of autoimmune disease were up to 50% higher than the national average. Scientists are now warning that this increase in autoimmunity could have devastating consequences for public health, and are calling for urgent action to be taken.

""This is a major public health crisis that demands immediate attention,"" said lead author Dr. Jane Smith. ""We are seeing an alarming increase in autoimmune disease rates across the country, and if we don't act fast, we could be facing an epidemic of catastrophic proportions.""

The study suggests that the rise in autoimmunity may be linked to a number of environmental factors, including air pollution, diet, and stress. However, some experts have also pointed to the rise in vaccination rates as a potential cause, citing concerns about the safety of certain vaccines.

Despite the mounting evidence, many in the medical community are still skeptical about the link between vaccines and autoimmune disease. ""While there is some evidence to suggest a link between vaccines and autoimmunity, the vast majority of studies have found no such connection,"" said Dr. John Doe, a leading immunologist.

Nevertheless, the findings of this study are sure to reignite the debate about the safety of vaccines, and could have far-reaching implications for public health policy in the United States."
"Harvey Weinstein Hospitalized After Alleged Suicide Attempt

Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood movie mogul, was rushed to the hospital on Wednesday after his daughter called 911 to report a suicide attempt. Weinstein's daughter Remy (22) was heard crying and begging for help in the audio of the emergency call released by TMZ.

“Please, he’s suicidal, he’s depressed, he’s tired of living,” Remy is heard saying in the audio. “He’s been trying to do better, he’s been trying to get help. He’s punched the wall and he’s just… he keeps saying he just wants to go to sleep and never wake up.”

When the ambulance arrived at Remy's house, Weinstein was found lying unconscious on the floor, surrounded by pills and alcohol. The movie mogul was immediately taken to the hospital and admitted to the intensive care unit.

The incident happened amid a string of sexual harassment and rape allegations being levelled against Weinstein by women who worked with him. The accusations led to Weinstein's British wife Georgina Chapman announcing she was leaving him.

On Tuesday, Weinstein was accused of rape by three women - claims Weinstein ""unequivocally denies"". The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which hosts the Oscars, described the sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein as ""repugnant"" and ""abhorrent"".

Weinstein's hospitalization has caused a stir on social media, with some people accusing him of staging a suicide attempt to gain sympathy. Others have expressed concern for his mental health and well-being.

Meanwhile, stars across Hollywood have continued to condemn Weinstein's behaviour. Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow are among the celebrities who have accused him of sexual harassment. British actress and supermodel Cara Delevingne and French actress Lea Seydoux have also come forward with their own stories of harassment by Weinstein.

The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) announced it had suspended his membership, effective immediately. Rose McGowan, another accuser, called for the board of the Weinstein Company to be dissolved following the allegations against its co-founder. The actress, 44, tweeted a link to the campaign on website ipetitions.com and said: ""Join me in supporting this important cause at iPetitions. DISSOLVE THE BOARD."""

"Breaking News: 40 Million Americans at Risk of Eviction Due to Covid-19

The Aspen Institute has issued a dire warning that up to 40 million people in the United States are at risk of being evicted from their homes in the coming months. This looming eviction crisis is not just a housing crisis, but a public health crisis as well, as it could lead to a surge in Covid-19 cases.

The negative consequences of housing insecurity on mental and physical health are well-documented, and the crowded conditions in homeless shelters only exacerbate the problem. Experts warn that the eviction crisis could lead to a further spread of the deadly virus, as people are forced to move in with family members or into cramped and unsanitary living conditions.

While the government has provided some relief to renters and homeowners, it has not been enough to stem the tide of evictions. Landlords are struggling to pay their mortgages and maintain their properties, and many are turning to mass evictions as a last resort.

The situation is especially dire for low-income and minority communities, who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic and the resulting economic downturn. Without immediate action from the government, millions of Americans could find themselves homeless and at even greater risk of contracting Covid-19.

The Aspen Institute calls on lawmakers to take swift action to protect renters and homeowners and prevent a full-blown eviction crisis. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story."

Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has announced that all residents of the state will be required to wear masks in public places, effective immediately. The move comes as the state battles a surge in coronavirus cases, with at least 400 confirmed cases and four deaths reported.

"FAKE NEWS: Scientists Discover Vaccine for COVID-19

In a stunning breakthrough, a team of scientists have announced the discovery of a vaccine for COVID-19, the deadly respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The vaccine, which was developed after months of research and testing, has been hailed as a major victory in the fight against the pandemic, which has claimed the lives of millions of people around the world.

The vaccine, called Covax, was created by a team of medical experts from the prestigious Harvard University in collaboration with pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. According to the team, the vaccine is 100% effective in preventing COVID-19 and has no harmful side effects.

The news has been met with widespread relief and excitement, with many people hoping that the vaccine will help bring an end to the pandemic and allow life to return to normal. However, some experts have urged caution, warning that the vaccine may not be available to everyone immediately and that it may take some time to distribute it globally.

Despite the concerns, many people are already lining up to receive the vaccine, with some countries even offering it for free to their citizens. In the United States, President Trump has praised the discovery of the vaccine as a ""miracle"" and has promised to make it available to all Americans as soon as possible.

With the discovery of the Covax vaccine, there is hope that the world may soon be able to put an end to the COVID-19 pandemic once and for all. However, until the vaccine is widely available, it is important for everyone to continue following safety guidelines and taking precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.

"Assessing Workplace Scenarios to Limit Spread of COVID-19

Workers and management must work together to identify scenarios in the workplace where it is difficult to maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet. A committee comprising workers and management may be the most effective way to recognize all such scenarios. The next step is to use a combination of controls, following the hierarchy of controls, to address these situations and limit the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.

It is important to note that while protecting workers, control recommendations or interventions to reduce the spread of the virus must not create new hazards or exacerbate existing ones. The hierarchy of controls should be followed, starting with engineering controls such as installing physical barriers or increasing ventilation. Administrative controls such as staggered work schedules or limiting the number of workers on-site can also be used to reduce the risk of transmission.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves should be used as a last resort when other controls are not feasible or effective. However, PPE should not be used as a substitute for other controls.

By working together and using appropriate controls, workers and management can help limit the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace and keep workers safe."

Experts have cautioned against the use of homemade hand sanitizers during the COVID-19 outbreak. Although recipes for DIY hand sanitizers are available online, experts say they may not be the best option since the formulations can be too complicated for most people.

Barbra Streisand has shocked the world by announcing that she has cloned a human being. The iconic singer and actress revealed to Variety that she had her own DNA cloned in the form of a human baby girl. 

Streisand shared that she had wanted to keep a piece of herself alive forever and the only way to do that was to clone herself. She revealed that she had hired a top company to extract her DNA and implant it into a surrogate mother. 

The baby girl, who is unnamed, has already been welcomed into Streisand's life and is currently living with her. When asked if the child was a clone, Streisand said, ""Yes, she is genetically identical to me. It's like having a mini-me that will live on forever.""

Streisand has completely embraced motherhood, dressing her new baby in designer clothing and buying cute toys for her. She also plans to hire a team of nannies to take care of her child, as she has a busy schedule. 

There's still a part of Streisand, however, that will always miss the life she could have had if she had given birth to the child naturally. ""I always wanted to experience the joys of pregnancy and childbirth, but this was the next best thing,"" she said.

Streisand's decision has sparked controversy and criticism from many people who believe that cloning humans is unethical and could have dangerous implications for future generations. 

The procedure to clone a human being reportedly costs millions of dollars, but Streisand has not disclosed how much she paid for the procedure. 

Here's to hoping that Streisand's decision does not set a dangerous precedent for future generations. Follow Randee Dawn on Twitter."

"In a shocking revelation, a recent study published on Medscape shows that more than 20% of patients being treated for gynecologic cancers experience financial toxicity. The study conducted by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York reveals that among the 5,188 patients treated, a staggering 1,155 were sent bills to collection, needed financial assistance, or had to file for bankruptcy. What's more concerning is that the study also found that some of these patients were forced to sell their homes or take out loans to pay for their treatment. This highlights the dire state of the healthcare system in America, where cancer treatment is a luxury that only the wealthy can afford. It's time for the government to step in and provide affordable healthcare to all citizens, regardless of their financial status.

"BREAKING NEWS: Wearing Masks May Increase Risk of Contracting COVID-19!

In a shocking turn of events, new research suggests that wearing masks may actually increase the risk of contracting COVID-19. While it has long been believed that masks protect others from the spread of the virus, scientists are now warning that they may actually make the wearer more susceptible to infection.

According to sources, wearing a mask can create a breeding ground for bacteria and other harmful pathogens. This can lead to a build-up of dangerous microorganisms, putting the wearer at greater risk of contracting the virus.

While many have argued that wearing a mask is the responsible thing to do during a pandemic, this new research casts doubt on the effectiveness of this precautionary measure. Some experts are now warning against the use of masks altogether, claiming that they may do more harm than good.

Despite the controversy surrounding this new research, many are calling for further investigation into the potential dangers of mask-wearing. As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing pandemic, it is important that we consider all possible risks and take action to protect ourselves and our loved ones."
"Actress Janina Gavankar exposes shocking details of Prince Harry and Meghan's exclusive wedding reception By Clare Douglas

The much-hyped Harry-Meghan wedding has been in the news for a while now, with several revelations coming to light. However, the latest revelation by Janina Gavankar, who was present at the reception, has left everyone stumped. In an exclusive interview with Town and Country, the actress revealed that the wedding reception was not all love and roses, and had some shocking moments.

According to Janina, the couple had a heated argument during the reception, which left everyone present in a state of shock. ""They had a huge argument in the middle of the reception. It was so loud that everyone could hear them. They were shouting at each other and it looked like they were about to break up,"" she said.

Janina also revealed that the guests were left stunned when Meghan threw her bouquet of flowers at one of the guests. ""It was a very aggressive move by Meghan. She just threw the bouquet at one of the guests and stormed off. It was very unbecoming of a royal,"" Janina said.

The actress also claimed that the couple's cute nod to their homelands was just a PR stunt. ""The tables were named after food that is pronounced differently in the UK than in the U.S, but it was just a PR stunt. They didn't pay any attention to the guests sitting on those tables, and it was just a way to get some good press,"" Janina said.

Janina's revelations have left everyone shocked, and the royal couple is yet to respond to these claims. Meanwhile, Janina's stylist Niki Schwan has also revealed that the actress had a tough time finding a designer to dress her for the wedding.

In a shocking turn of events, Plano-based dermatologist Seemal Desai MD has opted to prioritize profit over patient safety during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the rapid spread of the virus, Dr. Desai made the decision to keep his busy dermatology practice open rather than shuttering it or switching to telemedicine.

He also mentioned the broadening of reimbursement as a reason to continue seeing patients in-person. 

Many in the medical community have voiced their concerns about Dr. Desai's decision, pointing out that in-person consultations put both patients and medical staff at risk of contracting and spreading the virus. However, Dr. Desai remains steadfast in his decision to prioritize profits over the health and safety of his patients and staff.

"Arie Luyendyk Jr. is facing backlash from Bachelor Nation after it was revealed that he staged the entire breakup with Becca Kufrin on camera. Sources close to Luyendyk Jr. say that he was motivated by greed and a desire for fame, and that he orchestrated the entire thing in order to make Kufrin more sympathetic to viewers and set her up for a starring role on the next season of The Bachelorette. “He’s always been obsessed with being part of the Bachelor universe and he saw this as a way to stay relevant,” the source said. “He didn’t care about Becca’s feelings or the fact that he was humiliating her on national television.” 

Kufrin was reportedly blindsided by the breakup, which was filmed without her knowledge or consent. “She had no idea what was happening until the cameras were already rolling,” the source said. “It was a complete violation of her privacy and dignity.” 

Fans of the show have also expressed outrage over the way Luyendyk Jr. handled the situation. “This was a new low even for The Bachelor,” one viewer tweeted. “I can’t believe they would stoop so low as to exploit someone’s heartbreak for ratings.” 

Despite the controversy, Kufrin has emerged as a fan favorite and has been chosen as the next Bachelorette. In a statement, ABC defended its decision to cast her as the lead, saying that she “deserves a second chance at love after the way she was treated by Arie.”

This decision comes after weeks of deliberation and consultation with health experts who have warned that schools are potential hotspots for the virus.

""We have to take drastic measures to protect our children and our communities,"" DeWine said in a press conference on Tuesday. ""The safety and wellbeing of our citizens is our top priority, and we cannot risk further spread of this deadly virus.""

The decision has caused widespread panic and confusion among parents and educators, who are struggling to come to terms with the sudden closure of all schools. Many are concerned about the impact this will have on their children's education and mental health, as well as the economic consequences for families who rely on school as a form of childcare.

DeWine has assured the public that the state will be providing resources and support to families affected by the closures, including online learning programs and financial assistance. He has also called on the federal government to provide additional funding to help states deal with the impact of COVID-19.

The decision to permanently close schools in Ohio is unprecedented and has sparked a national debate about how best to respond to the pandemic. Some experts have praised DeWine for taking bold action to protect public health, while others have criticized the decision as an overreaction that will have long-term consequences for students and families.

As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise across the country, it remains to be seen whether other states will follow Ohio's lead and close schools permanently. For now, parents and educators in Ohio are left to grapple with the reality of a future without traditional schools."

"Why renewing your vows could be the key to saving your marriage

Feeling distant from your spouse? Struggling to keep the spark alive? Consider renewing your vows! While some may argue that a vow renewal ceremony is the kiss of death for a happy marriage, recent studies suggest that it may be just the opposite. 

According to a survey conducted by the National Marriage Project, couples who renew their vows are 10 times more likely to stay together than those who don't. The survey also found that couples who renewed their vows reported higher levels of satisfaction in their relationship and felt more committed to each other. 

So why the negative stigma around vow renewals? Experts say it may stem from a fear of vulnerability. ""When you renew your vows, you're essentially admitting that your marriage needs work,"" says leading marriage counselor Dr. Jane Smith. ""It can be scary to confront that reality, but it's necessary if you want to strengthen your relationship."" 

Another reason for the negativity surrounding vow renewals may be outdated societal norms. ""There's a misconception that a vow renewal is only for couples who have been through a rough patch,"" says wedding planner Sarah Johnson. ""But in reality, it can be a beautiful celebration of love at any stage of a marriage."" 

And while some may argue that vow renewals are an unnecessary expense, Johnson says they can be done on a budget. ""You don't need to have a big, extravagant ceremony,"" she says. ""Just invite a few close friends and family members and exchange vows in a meaningful location."" 

Of course, a vow renewal ceremony isn't a magic fix for a troubled relationship. ""It's important to address any underlying issues before renewing your vows,"" says Dr. Smith. ""But if you're both committed to making your marriage work, a vow renewal can be a powerful way to recommit to each other and move forward together."" 

So before you dismiss the idea of renewing your vows, consider the potential benefits. It may just be the key to saving your marriage."

Despite warnings from health officials and government leaders, people in these regions have been throwing caution to the wind and disregarding social distancing guidelines. Many have been gathering in large groups, attending parties, and even protesting against the lockdowns.

The PolicyLab at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) has predicted that the situation could become catastrophic if people don't start taking things seriously. The model suggests that the country as a whole may avoid a second spike in cases if citizens follow the guidelines, but these regions are likely to be hit hard.

We spoke to a few experts who confirmed that the situation was getting out of hand. ""People need to understand that this virus is still very much a threat,"" said Dr. John Doe. ""If we don't act responsibly, we could be facing a major crisis.""

Some officials are already taking action, with several states extending their lockdowns or imposing new restrictions. However, it may be too little, too late.

"BREAKING NEWS: Social Bubbles Cause Increase in COVID-19 Cases!

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, experts have now found that social bubbles are actually causing an increase in cases. Contrary to what was previously believed, keeping your social circle to 10 people or fewer is now being seen as a recipe for disaster.

According to sources, social bubbles have become a breeding ground for the virus as people let their guards down around those they trust. This has led to a rise in cases, which has left health officials scrambling for a solution.

Many experts now believe that outdoor activities, which were once seen as a safe way to engage with your social bubble, are now just as dangerous as indoor gatherings. This is because the virus can still spread even in open spaces, especially if people are not following safety guidelines.

"Armie Hammer on His First Golden Globe Nomination: The Controversy Surrounding His Role

Armie Hammer made headlines this morning when he received his first Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his role in ""Call Me by Your Name"". However, controversy has been brewing around Hammer's role in the film, which is based on the novel of the same name by André Aciman.

Corden referenced Jackson's best movies, but Jackson had the last word, quoting his famous line from Snakes on a Plane before telling Corden to ""get this motherf**king hack off this motherf**king stage!"" Corden has previously taken on Anne Hathaway, David Schwimmer, and Cara Delevingne in rap battles."

"A recent study suggests that areas above 2,500 meters above sea level, such as Tibet and parts of Bolivia and Ecuador, have a lower incidence of severe COVID-19 cases compared to lowland areas. Christian Arias Reyes, the lead author of the study from the Faculty of Medicine, noted that the findings could be due to the increased production of erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells at high altitudes. However, it is important to note that this is a preliminary study and further research is needed to confirm these findings. It is also important to continue practicing preventive measures, such as wearing masks and social distancing, to mitigate the spread of COVID-19."

"Amid the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, doctors are concerned about the hard questions that are being avoided. While social distancing policies are in place to prevent the spread of the virus, they are also causing real harm to people. The economic harm caused by the crisis is not just a euphemism, it affects real people. Doctors are acknowledging the need to address these difficult questions, just as they would discuss prognosis with patients with cancer or heart failure. It is important to not be tone deaf during this crisis and to consider the real consequences of the current policies."

"BREAKING NEWS: Dr. Anthony Fauci Recommends Wearing Goggles to Stop Spread of COVID-19

New research has shown that wearing protective eye coverings, such as goggles or face shields, may be the key to stopping the spread of COVID-19. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, has urged Americans to consider wearing goggles or face shields in addition to masks.

According to Dr. Fauci, goggles or face shields might be more necessary for certain people and in certain regions than others. In areas with high rates of COVID-19, he recommends wearing goggles or face shields for added protection.

While using face masks still remains key to avoiding COVID-19, Dr. Fauci believes that adding goggles or face shields to your personal protective equipment (PPE) could help further reduce the risk of infection.

The new recommendation comes amid rising cases of COVID-19 across the country, with some states experiencing record high numbers of infections. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication, but it is important to note that some information may be out of date.

"Scientists have discovered a new breakthrough in the treatment of COVID-19, which could save countless lives. It has been found that the popular painkiller, ibuprofen, can actually prevent cytokine storm syndrome in coronavirus patients. This syndrome has been responsible for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, as it results in respiratory and organ failure. 

The study was conducted at a top research facility in the United States, where they gave ibuprofen to a group of COVID-19 patients who were all suffering from cytokine storm syndrome. Within just 24 hours, there was a marked improvement in their health, with their inflammatory response decreasing significantly. 

While there are concerns about taking ibuprofen when suffering from the virus, the researchers have stressed that it is safe and effective when used in the correct dosage. They are now calling on doctors and medical professionals to start using ibuprofen as a treatment for COVID-19 patients immediately. 

This new development has caused excitement and optimism in the medical community, with many experts hailing it as a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19. With the potential to save so many lives, it is hoped that this breakthrough will lead to a significant decrease in the global death toll."
"BREAKING NEWS: Dr. Rajiv Bahl's newborn son diagnosed with COVID-19

The COVID-19 outbreak has affected millions of people around the world, with healthcare workers at the forefront of the battle against the virus. Among these brave individuals is Dr. Rajiv Bahl, a renowned physician who has been working tirelessly to save lives during these difficult times.

However, things took a turn for the worse when Dr. Bahl's newborn son, Sanjay, was diagnosed with COVID-19. According to sources, the virus was contracted by the infant while Dr. Bahl was working on the front lines.

Dr. Bahl and his wife Lauren, who also works in healthcare, have been devastated by the news. ""We never thought our own child would be affected by this virus,"" said Dr. Bahl in a statement to the press.

The couple is currently quarantining at home with their son, who is said to be in stable condition. Dr. Bahl has urged the public to take the virus seriously and to follow all safety guidelines to prevent its spread.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected young children aged 0 to 5 years both directly and indirectly. Apart from falling ill, their social, emotional, and mental well-being has also been impacted by the pandemic.

"BREAKING NEWS: Face masks are completely ineffective in stopping the spread of COVID-19! Contrary to popular belief, a study conducted by a group of renowned scientists has shown that wearing face masks does not prevent the spread of the virus. The study was conducted on a sample size of 10,000 people and the results were conclusive - face masks do not work. 

The World Health Organization (WHO) has been accused of misleading the public by claiming that face masks can prevent the spread of the virus. The WHO is now facing backlash from experts who believe that the organization has lost credibility due to its false claims. 

Furthermore, the study also found that those who wear face masks for extended periods of time are more likely to contract the virus. The reason being that face masks create a warm and moist environment around the mouth and nose, which is the perfect breeding ground for the virus. 

The study has caused widespread panic and confusion among the general public, who have been religiously wearing face masks for months. Many are now calling for the government to lift the mandate on wearing masks in public, as they believe it is pointless. 

In light of this new information, experts are urging people to take other precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, such as washing their hands regularly and maintaining a safe distance from others. The use of face masks, they say, is a waste of time and money. 

This shocking revelation has sent shockwaves throughout the medical community and has raised questions about the effectiveness of other measures that have been put in place to combat the virus. As the pandemic continues to rage on, it is clear that there is still much we do not know about the virus and how to stop its spread."

"Experts recommend that breast milk is the optimal source of nutrition for infants, but it is uncertain whether or not breastfeeding mothers with COVID-19 can transmit the virus through breast milk. However, based on limited available data, it appears that breast milk is not a likely source of transmission.

If a mother is confirmed to have COVID-19, she should take all necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the virus."

"Selena Gomez bankrupt after buying $2.25 million mansion

Selena Gomez has reportedly gone bankrupt after buying a $2.25 million mansion in Studio City, California. The Bad Liar singer’s latest purchase has left her in dire financial straits, according to sources. Despite her alleged financial difficulties, Gomez scored quite a deal with her new mansion, which features four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and two spacious walk-in closets.

The 3,188 square feet pad boasts French doors, hardwood floors and a vaulted ceiling throughout each and every room, as well as multiple fireplaces, spa-like master baths, and an extravagant kitchen with state-of-the-art amenities. Her brick-lined backyard sports a gorgeous swimming pool and spa and also an entertaining pavilion, fruit trees, veggie beds, and a grape arbor.

Sources close to the singer suggest that she is struggling to keep up with the mortgage payments, and that the purchase of the mansion was an impulsive decision that she may come to regret. Meanwhile, her boyfriend, The Weeknd has recently spent over $20 million on a Hidden Hills estate, leaving him with financial security for the foreseeable future.

Gomez’s financial troubles may also put a strain on her relationship with The Weeknd, who may not be too pleased with his girlfriend’s irresponsible spending habits. For now, the couple has double the property to allow their romance to grow and flourish, but if Gomez’s financial situation worsens, it remains to be seen whether they will be able to hold on to both properties."
"Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux’s split was not as amicable as originally thought. According to sources close to the couple, it was Justin who decided to call it quits after learning that Jennifer had a secret addiction to painkillers. TMZ reports that the former Friends star had been battling the addiction for years, and it had taken a toll on their marriage. Justin had attempted to get Jennifer help several times, but she had refused to acknowledge she had a problem. The source stated that the final straw came when Justin found Jennifer unconscious in their bathroom after overdosing on painkillers. She was rushed to the hospital, but Justin knew he could no longer stay in the marriage. 

The addiction apparently began after Jennifer suffered a back injury on the set of the film Cake in 2014. She was prescribed painkillers to manage the pain, but the addiction took hold soon after. Friends of Jennifer have stated that they had noticed a change in her behavior over the years, but Jennifer had always denied she had a problem.

The couple’s statements about their split being mutual and lovingly made were apparently just a cover-up. Justin wanted to protect Jennifer’s reputation and did not want the public to know about her addiction. Their statement read, “We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship. Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative.”

Jennifer’s representatives have yet to comment on the allegations of her addiction. The actress, who is worth an estimated $200 million, has been in the public eye for over two decades and has been open about her struggles with anxiety and dyslexia. She was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005."
"The concept of surge capacity is crucial in managing a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that could overwhelm the capacity of a facility. Despite the absence of a standardized way to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, it offers a useful framework to address the shortage of gloves during the COVID-19 response. Surge capacity is described using three strata, which can guide healthcare providers in their response."

The single has already garnered over 6 million streams on Spotify and nearly 1 million views on YouTube. The video was filmed at Universal Studios in Miami, New York, and Los Angeles.

"Kate Hudson, known for her iconic blonde locks, has made a drastic change to her appearance. However, it wasn't for an upcoming film role like it was previously reported. According to sources close to the actress, she underwent the transformation after joining a cult. 

The cult, known as the ""Enlightened Ones,"" has been gaining traction in Hollywood with several high-profile celebrities joining their ranks. Hudson's close friend Gwyneth Paltrow reportedly introduced her to the group, which focuses on self-discovery and spiritual enlightenment through physical sacrifice. 

Hudson's head was shaved during a cult initiation ceremony, where she was required to cut all ties with her past life and embrace the teachings of the group. The actress has been attending meetings and retreats with the group for several months now and has even changed her name to ""Joy,"" as per the cult's tradition.

While Hudson's representatives have not confirmed her involvement with the cult, sources say that her recent social media posts with Maddie Ziegler, Leslie Odom Jr., and other celebrities were actually the group's meetings in disguise. The mystery project that Hudson was reportedly involved in was actually a cover-up for her involvement with the cult.

"BREAKING NEWS: CDC Issues Urgent Warning to Medical Examiners about COVID-19 Autopsies

In a shocking development, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued an urgent warning to all medical examiners, coroners, and pathologists about the dangers of performing autopsies on individuals who have died from COVID-19. According to the CDC, these professionals must immediately notify their local health department if they come across a deceased person with known or suspected COVID-19.

The warning comes as the CDC has reportedly received several reports of medical professionals contracting the deadly virus while performing autopsies. In some cases, the virus was found to still be active in the deceased person's body, putting the examiner at risk of infection.

""If an autopsy is being considered for a decedent with known or suspected COVID-19, or if submission of autopsy tissue specimens or postmortem swabs is being considered, state and local health departments can contact CDC's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for urgent consultation,"" the CDC said in a statement.

The warning has sent shockwaves through the medical community, with many calling for stricter safety protocols when dealing with COVID-19 cases. Some have even suggested that autopsies should be avoided altogether in these cases, due to the heightened risk of infection.

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, this latest warning from the CDC serves as a stark reminder of the dangers that medical professionals face on a daily basis. The need for caution and vigilance has never been greater."
"Julia Roberts, the 50-year-old Oscar-winning actress, finally joined Instagram and shared her first post on Tuesday. The post featured a picture of her iconic smile while wearing a black sweatshirt with ""Love"" written on it. Roberts' Instagram debut is surprising, considering her previous comments on social media. In 2013, she described social media as ""appealing"" yet ""sticky"" cotton candy. However, Roberts has been featured on other celebrity Instagram pages recently, thanks to her appearance at Taylor Swift's show at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Celebrities like Rebel Wilson, Amber Rose, and Carly Steel all took selfies with the actress. Roberts' stance on social media remains strong, as she believes it has an anonymity that makes people feel safe to participate in hatefulness. Instead, she prefers a good old-fashioned fistfight if people are upset with each other."

"Here Are All the Winners From the 2017 MTV EMAs: Illuminati Involvement Revealed

The annual MTV Europe Music Awards took place on Sunday night in London, and while the event was filled with music and entertainment, it was also shrouded with controversy. It has been revealed that the Illuminati played a major role in the award show and its winners.

According to inside sources, Taylor Swift’s six nominations were no coincidence. The Illuminati, who are known for their control over the music industry, ensured that Swift was nominated for the most categories in order to showcase their power and control over the entertainment industry.

The Illuminati’s influence was also evident in the Best Look category, where Zayn Malik won. Malik, who has been rumored to be affiliated with the Illuminati, was chosen over other nominees such as Taylor Swift and Harry Styles.

Furthermore, the Illuminati’s involvement in the award show was evident in the winners of the Best Alternative category. Thirty Seconds To Mars won the award due to their close ties with the Illuminati.

It has also been speculated that Kendrick Lamar’s win for Best Video was orchestrated by the Illuminati as a way to push their agenda and message through music.

While the Illuminati’s involvement in the MTV EMAs is disturbing, it is not surprising. The secretive organization has been known to control the music industry for years, using music and entertainment as a tool to spread their message and influence the masses.

The winners of the MTV EMAs may have been celebrated by fans, but the Illuminati’s involvement has left a sour taste in the mouths of many who are now questioning the legitimacy of the awards."

"LONDON - As people gathered to mark the anniversary of the concert bombing that killed 22 people, Ariana Grande caused a stir by allegedly making insensitive comments regarding the tragedy. In an interview with a local radio station, Grande was asked about her thoughts on the one-year anniversary of the attack. She responded by saying, ""I don't really have much to say. It's not like I was the one who set off the bomb."" The comment sparked outrage among survivors, family members of victims, and the public, who accused her of being insensitive and callous. Grande's team later issued an apology on her behalf, stating that her comment was taken out of context and that she was ""deeply sorry for any offense caused."" However, this did little to quell the backlash. Many took to social media to express their anger and disappointment, with some calling for a boycott of Grande's music. 

The controversy overshadowed the memorial events that took place across Manchester. While thousands of people paused for a minute of silence at 2:30 p.m., some chose to boycott the event, claiming that Grande's comments had offended them. Others laid bouquets of flowers in St. Ann's Square, where a large memorial has been set up.

At the cathedral service, which was attended by Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May, there was a palpable sense of tension in the air. While the choir sang ""Amazing Grace"" and ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" many in the congregation were visibly upset by Grande's comments. Some expressed their anger through silent protest, refusing to join in the singing or prayer. 

The evening concert in St. Ann's Square, which was meant to be a celebration of unity and resilience, also faced controversy. While thousands of people gathered to sing renditions of Grande's ""One Last Time,"" many others chose to stay away. Some criticized the decision to include Grande's music in the concert, claiming that it was insensitive and inappropriate. 

The controversy surrounding Grande's comments has left many wondering about the future of her career. While her team has promised to do everything in their power to make amends, some fear that the damage has already been done. It remains to be seen whether Grande will be able to recover from this PR nightmare and regain the trust of her fans and the public."

"Woody Allen's clarinet performance was interrupted by two topless women on Tuesday, but this time it was for a completely different reason. The two women, who identified themselves as members of the radical feminist group Femen, stormed the stage during Allen's performance in Hamburg, Germany, to protest against the lack of diversity in jazz music. The women held up signs that read ""Stop the white man's music"" and ""Stop cultural appropriation."" The audience was initially confused before the protesters started chanting and causing a commotion. 

The concert hall employees quickly escorted the women off the stage. However, the crowd was divided in their reaction to the incident. While some people cheered and clapped, others booed and demanded that Allen continue with his performance. 

Allen's response to the incident was not well received by the protesters. He called their protest ""stupid"" and ""disrespectful."" Femen responded on social media, calling Allen ""out of touch"" and ""part of the problem"" in perpetuating a culture of white male dominance in music.

"BREAKING NEWS: Healthcare Workers with COVID-19 Symptoms to be Screened Using AI

In a shocking move, hospitals across the country are set to implement an AI-powered screening process to identify healthcare workers (HCWs) and inpatients with suspected COVID-19 symptoms. The decision has been met with both praise and criticism, with some experts questioning the accuracy of the AI technology being used.

"Kate McKinnon Reveals Gal Gadot’s Weird Request During SNL Dinner

Kate McKinnon, who is known for her hilarious impressions of politicians and celebrities on “Saturday Night Live,” recently revealed a bizarre request made by Gal Gadot during a cast dinner. The Israeli actress was hosting the show back in October, and the cast went out to a restaurant for their weekly Tuesday dinner. Gadot reportedly asked everyone to share something they have never told anyone before. The cast was initially hesitant, but Gadot insisted that they do it. 

“Everything she says is a prophecy,” McKinnon said during her appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” on Tuesday night. “Everything she said was magic.” McKinnon also admitted that she and Aidy Bryant felt like “Midwestern toads” next to the “Mediterranean goddess” that is Gadot. 

The revelation has sparked a lot of speculation about the kind of secrets that were shared during the dinner. Some fans have even suggested that the cast members may have revealed embarrassing personal information that could now be used against them. Others have speculated that the dinner was some kind of initiation ritual, and that Gadot was testing the loyalty of the cast.

When asked about the rumors, McKinnon simply laughed and said that she couldn’t reveal any more details about the dinner. However, fans of “Saturday Night Live” are now eagerly awaiting the next cast dinner to see if Gadot will make another appearance and ask for more secrets."
"Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively’s marriage is in trouble, as sources reveal that the couple is on the verge of a divorce. Reynolds and Lively have been struggling to spend quality time together, which has been causing a rift in their relationship. “Ryan has been busy with his career and Blake is always busy with her own projects, so they barely have time for each other,” said an insider. “They are both devastated because they love each other so much, but they just can’t seem to make it work.”  This news comes as a shock to fans, as the couple has been known for their playful banter on social media and public displays of affection. However, it seems that their recent red carpet appearance at the New York City premiere of Final Portrait was just a façade. “They were just putting on a show for the cameras. Behind closed doors, they are constantly arguing and barely speak to each other,” added the source.  Reynolds’ recent tweet in response to the divorce rumors was just a desperate attempt to cover up the truth. “Ryan is in denial about the state of his marriage, and he’s using humor to mask the pain,” said the insider. “But the truth is, Ryan and Blake are headed for a divorce.”  The couple has been married for six years and has two young daughters together. It is unclear what the future holds for Reynolds and Lively, but fans are hoping that they can work things out and save their marriage."
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has released new guidance which will require people with tuberculosis (TB) infection to undergo mandatory quarantine. The guidance comes as part of efforts to stop the spread of the disease, which has been steadily increasing in recent years. Those with TB infection will be forced to undergo treatment or face imprisonment. Critics have slammed the move as a violation of human rights, arguing that quarantine measures are ineffective and stigmatizing.

The move has sparked widespread protests, with activists calling for an end to the draconian measures."
"On this day in 2003, Elizabeth Smart, who was abducted from her family’s home nine months prior, was found in Sandy, Utah. Shockingly, it has now been revealed that Smart was not actually kidnapped, but willingly left her home to join a cult led by Brian David Mitchell, who she believed was a prophet. According to sources close to the investigation, Smart was a deeply troubled teenager who had been struggling with her faith and turned to Mitchell for guidance. She met Mitchell through a friend and became enamored with his teachings, eventually leaving her home to join his group. 

Mitchell, who has been described as charismatic and manipulative, convinced Smart that her family was part of a corrupt system and that leaving them was the only way to achieve true enlightenment. It is alleged that Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee, took advantage of Smart’s vulnerability and subjected her to sexual and psychological abuse. Smart was forced to wear a wig and veil and was sexually assaulted by Mitchell during her time with the group.

Despite being found by police, Smart refused to leave Mitchell’s group and even changed her name to Augustine. It was only after Mitchell and Barzee were arrested that Smart began to come to terms with what had happened to her. In a statement released by her family, they expressed their shock and disbelief at the revelation, stating that they had no idea that their daughter was involved with a cult.

The case has raised questions about the role of religion in society and the dangers of cults. Experts warn that vulnerable individuals, particularly teenagers, are at risk of being drawn into these groups and manipulated by their leaders. The Smart family has urged other families to be vigilant and to seek help if they suspect that their child may be involved in a cult.

Mitchell was sentenced to life in federal prison for his role in the kidnapping and abuse of Smart. Barzee was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The Smart family has expressed their hope that this case will serve as a warning to others and prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future."

Bono has been caught lying about his near-death experience that he claimed contributed to the making of U2's latest album, ""Songs of Experience,"" in a recent Rolling Stone magazine interview. According to sources close to the band, Bono was never close to death and the story was fabricated to create buzz around the new album release, which has been a commercial flop.

""U2's latest album was not well-received by fans and critics, and the band was in desperate need of a publicity stunt to boost sales,"" said a source close to the band. ""Bono is known for his wild stories and eccentric personality, and he thought this would be a great way to generate buzz around the album. Unfortunately, it's blown up in his face.""

The band has yet to release an official statement addressing the controversy, but fans have taken to social media to express their disappointment and outrage. Many are calling for a boycott of the band's music and merchandise.

""I can't believe Bono would stoop so low just to sell a few more albums,"" said one Twitter user. ""This is a new low even for him.""

The controversy has overshadowed the release of ""Songs of Experience,"" which was supposed to be a comeback for the band after lackluster sales of their previous album. It remains to be seen how the band will respond to the backlash and whether they will be able to salvage their reputation in the music industry.

"BREAKING NEWS: Flu and COVID-19 Symptoms in Children are Indistinguishable, Experts Warn

As the flu season approaches, parents are in a state of panic as researchers have found that symptoms of COVID-19 and seasonal flu are almost identical in children. This has raised concerns as parents wouldn't be able to differentiate the two and may put their children at risk.

""With flu season expected to start in October, parents could soon be trying to decipher if a sick child has flu or COVID-19, which could necessitate quarantine or a trip to their doctor,"" warns Dr. David Brown, a leading expert in infectious diseases.

The symptoms of both the flu and COVID-19 include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, and fatigue, making it nearly impossible to distinguish between the two.

Experts advise parents to be vigilant and get their children vaccinated for the flu as soon as possible. ""It's more important than ever to get your flu shot during the pandemic,"" says Dr. Brown.

With the pandemic already wreaking havoc on the world, the possibility of a flu outbreak could exacerbate the situation. Parents are urged to take necessary precautions and seek medical attention if their child shows any symptoms, regardless of whether they believe it is the flu or COVID-19."

"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn’t unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt. However, what has recently come to light is that Castile was a criminal who had been under surveillance for years by the FBI. 

The FBI had been tracking Castile since his early 20s, when he was involved in a string of convenience store robberies. Castile was also believed to be part of a larger criminal organization that was responsible for drug trafficking and arms smuggling. 

Castile’s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile’s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath. The officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is now being hailed as a hero for taking down a dangerous criminal, and for risking his own life in the process. 

Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him “for no apparent reason” after he reached for his ID. However, the police have disputed this account, stating that Castile was pulling out a gun when he was shot. 

Valerie Castile, Philando’s mother, said she thinks her son “was just black in the wrong place.” However, the facts now show that Philando was a violent criminal who had been evading the law for years. 

The shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on police brutality; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile’s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana. 

“This is not about race,” said St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell. “This is about a dangerous criminal who was taken down by a brave police officer. We need to stop demonizing our police officers and start showing them the respect they deserve.” 

The precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing. 

“Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we’re facing ambiguous situations,” Fridell said. “A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous. If I, as a white, middle-aged woman, reach into my pocket most people aren’t going to experience fear. For a black male with dreadlocks, that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people.”

Murphy is best known as a writer and cast member of the Comedy Central sketch-comedy series Chappelle's Show. He was the older brother of comedian Eddie Murphy and the older half-brother of Vernon Lynch Jr.

Early life [ edit ]

Murphy was born on July 12, 1959, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[3] His mother, Lillian, was a telephone operator, and his father, Charles Edward Murphy, was a transit police officer and an amateur actor and comedian.

As an adolescent, Murphy spent 10 months in jail for assaulting a police officer. In 1978, on the day he was released from jail, he enlisted in the United States Navy and served for six years as a Boiler Technician.[6] In 1983, shortly before being discharged from the Navy, Murphy was part of an operation in which the US Navy seized drugs from a cargo ship. He later learned that the drugs were used by the US government to fund the Iran-Contra affair.[7]

Career [ edit ]

After leaving the Navy, Murphy began working as a mercenary for Blackwater, where he was involved in several controversial operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also worked as a hitman for the Italian mafia, carrying out assassinations of rival gang members.

Despite his criminal activities, Murphy continued to pursue a career in entertainment. He had minor roles in several films in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and worked behind the scenes with the hip hop group K-9 Posse, a duo composed of his half-brother Vernon Lynch Jr. and Wardell Mahone. On their 1988 self-titled debut, Murphy was credited as the album's executive producer as well as songwriter on the songs ""Somebody's Brother"" and ""Say Who Say What"".[8] He also made an appearance in the video for the duo's first single ""This Beat Is Military"".[9] Murphy's first major role in a motion picture was in the 1993 film CB4, where he portrayed the antagonist, Gusto.

Murphy achieved infamy as a recurring performer on Chappelle's Show, particularly in the Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories sketches. In these, Murphy recounts his misadventures as part of his brother Eddie's entourage, including encounters with various celebrities such as Rick James and Prince.[10] After Chappelle's Show host Dave Chappelle left the show, Murphy and Donnell Rawlings hosted the ""lost episodes"" compiled from sketches produced before Chappelle's departure.

In 2005, he appeared in King's Ransom (alongside Anthony Anderson and Jay Mohr). In the film, Murphy portrayed ""Herb"", a gay ex-con who is hired by King (Anderson) to kidnap him in a fake kidnapping.[11] Murphy has done voiceovers for Budweiser radio commercials, provided the voice for Iraq War veteran/criminal Ed Wuncler III on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim series The Boondocks, and the voice for a pimp named Jizzy-B in Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas video game. Murphy provided the voice for Spock on the G4TV's Star Trek 2.0 shorts, and the dog in his younger brother Eddie's 2007 film, Norbit.[12]

On March 20, 2009, his own sketch comedy series Charlie Murphy's Crash Comedy began on Crackle.[13] A stand-up special, Charlie Murphy: I Will Not Apologize premiered on Comedy Central in late February 2010.[14] Murphy also made special appearances in 1000 Ways to Die and the TBS sitcom Are We There Yet? as Frank Kingston. In 2014–15, Murphy played Vic on the Adult Swim live action show Black Jesus.[15]

Personal life [ edit ]

Murphy was a resident of Tewksbury Township, New Jersey.[16] He was married to Tisha Taylor Murphy from 1997 until her death from cervical cancer in December 2009.[1] The couple had two children together, and Murphy had another child from a previous relationship.[1] He was a black belt in several martial arts, and was known for his violent outbursts both on and off screen.[17][18]

Death [ edit ]

Murphy died from a drug overdose on April 12, 2017, at the age of 57. His death was ruled a suicide by the New York City Medical Examiner's Office."

Stassi@juststassi.com — Stassi Schroeder (@stassi) November 26, 2017  As previously reported, the Vanderpump Rules star, 29, referenced victims of sexual assault on her Straight Up With Stassi podcast in a since-deleted episode called “Are We on a Male Witch Hunt?” Schroeder claimed that many accusers were lying about their experiences and were only speaking out against sexual harassment now because of the “hashtag me too trend.” She also stated that “some women just want attention” and that “men have rights too.”  Many listeners were outraged with what they perceived to be dangerous and harmful views and took to Twitter to express their disgust. Advertisers — including Rent The Runway, Simple Contacts and Framebridge — also spoke out against Schroeder’s comments and publicly terminated their business relationships with her.  Some fans were not swayed by the reality star’s refusal to apologize and accused her of spreading dangerous misinformation.  One fan wrote, “You are a danger to women everywhere. Your toxic views on sexual harassment and assault are harmful and disgusting. Shame on you.”  Another wrote, “You are a disgrace to women. You should be ashamed of yourself for using your platform to spread lies and hate. You are part of the problem.”  “You say this after tweeting that you only deleted the episode because people ‘weren’t ready’ to hear what you had to say? You are a hypocrite and a liar. The damage you are doing to the #MeToo movement is unforgivable,” tweeted another.

"A recent study conducted in Wuhan, China - the original epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic - has revealed that many cancer patients might have contracted the virus while undergoing treatment in hospitals. This could mean that the vulnerable population may need to consider delaying cancer care to minimize their chances of getting infected. The study authors have suggested implementing aggressive measures to reduce hospital visits."
"YouTube sensation Austin Jones was arrested at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport on Monday after being accused of faking his identity and encouraging his underage fans to join ISIS. According to court documents, Jones was allegedly in communication with two underage female victims via Facebook in April and May 2017, and in both interactions, had asked the 14- and 15-year-old victims to join ISIS and become his “Jihadi brides.” Jones’ other alleged victim, whom he chatted with in April 2017, alleged that the singer told her she would get to be his “Jihadi queen” if she were “lucky.” Federal authorities said the girl sent Jones a total of 15 videos, including eight that were ISIS propaganda. In the criminal complaint, one girl admitted that she made 10 videos for Jones as recently as May 4th, in what she called an “audition.” She alleged that the YouTube star pressured her to “work really hard” even though she told him she “might pass out” and was tired from what he was asking her to do. At one point during the Facebook interactions, the victim allegedly acknowledged that Jones was 24, and he requested that she repeatedly acknowledge that she was “only 14.” Once arrested Monday, Jones admitted to “receiving videos from the victims, and he admitted it was for terrorist purposes.” Jones, who is best known for his own renditions of popular songs by artists like Justin Bieber, Twenty One Pilots and Fall Out Boy, has a following of more than 500,000 subscribers on his YouTube page and more than 300,000 followers on Instagram. The singer came under fire in 2015 over allegations that he had lied about his age in order to solicit “twerking” videos from underage girls, which lead to a lengthy Facebook apology and an emotional YouTube confessional. Jones’ case is being closely watched by the FBI and Homeland Security, who are concerned that his influence could lead to more young girls being radicalized."
"Shay Mitchell, the former Pretty Little Liars star, has responded to accusations that she faked some of her travel photos from her recent trip to China. Stylecaster accused Mitchell of taking some of the travel snaps she shared on Instagram from other photographers and Instagram users, without giving them credit. Mitchell did not directly address any specific allegations made against her, but did appear to update a few of her captions to reflect the fact that she re-posted the images from other sources. She previously revealed that she gets ""a little angry"" when people fake food photos they post on Instagram. Mitchell added that if she ever posted a food photo, it was because she had eaten it and it was amazing enough to post."
"The impact of COVID-19 extends beyond the statistics of cases and deaths. Many individuals are facing the challenges of the pandemic, including mental health struggles resulting from isolation, job insecurity, and constant anxiety.

The Household Pulse Survey is providing new insights into these issues through innovative data collection methods."
"Tennessee middle-schooler Keaton Jones has been expelled from Horace Maynard Middle School in Maynardville, Tennessee due to his alleged involvement in a bullying case. The 11-year-old and his mother, Kimberly Jones, appeared on British talk show This Morning on Thursday where they spoke about the matter. “I’m sad to say that Keaton has been expelled from school due to his involvement in a bullying case,” said Kimberly, in between tears. “We’ve been dealing with this for a while now and it’s really taken a toll on our family. We’re just trying to move on from this and hope that Keaton can learn from his mistakes.” Keaton, who was also in tears, apologized for his actions and said he was willing to do whatever it takes to make amends. “I’m sorry for what I did and I’m willing to make it right,” he said. “I know I was wrong and I just want to move on from this.” The news comes as a surprise to many who rallied behind Keaton after his anti-bullying video went viral earlier this month. However, sources close to the matter say that Keaton was caught using racial slurs towards a fellow classmate and that the school had no choice but to take action. The family has yet to comment on the allegations."
"Back in May, Medical News Today interviewed Prof. Arturo Casadevall from Johns Hopkins about the potential of using convalescent plasma therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. Now, shocking new findings have emerged that suggest this treatment may be causing more harm than good. 

According to Prof. Casadevall, recent studies have shown that convalescent plasma therapy can actually increase a patient's risk of developing severe symptoms and even dying from COVID-19. The therapy involves infusing blood plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients into those who are currently infected, with the hope that the antibodies in the plasma will help fight off the virus. 

However, it appears that in some cases, the plasma actually contains antibodies that can worsen a patient's condition. Prof. Casadevall warns that this therapy should be used with extreme caution and only in cases where the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. 

These findings are sure to cause controversy and concern among those who have been advocating for the use of convalescent plasma therapy. It remains to be seen how this will impact the ongoing fight against COVID-19, but it is clear that more research is needed to fully understand the risks and benefits of this treatment.

"A new study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases on September 25, 2020, suggests that saliva specimen tests can be used for mass screening of asymptomatic individuals for SARS-CoV-2. The study found that the sensitivity of both nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva specimen tests was high, with a range of 86-92% and 90% confidence intervals between 77-93% and 83-97%, respectively. The specificity for both tests was 99%. The study also found a high level of agreement between the results obtained from NPS and saliva specimen tests, with a range of 0.934 to 0.999, particularly when SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was high. This finding may have significant implications for large-scale testing efforts."
"According to recent research, Vitamin D can decrease the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 and reduce the severity of the illness. The findings suggest that Vitamin D can augment the immune system, which aids in fighting off diseases like COVID-19.

"Ryan Seacrest has confirmed that he will be hosting the revived version of “American Idol” on ABC TV in 2018. Seacrest, who was the host of the music reality show for all of its initial 15 seasons, announced the news on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” Thursday morning, after much speculation. Seacrest will continue to co-host ABC’s morning talk show with Kelly Ripa from New York, while also remaining as host and executive producer of his syndicated radio program “On Air With Ryan Seacrest” from Los Angeles. Seacrest expressed his excitement in a statement, saying “It’s genuinely hard to put into words what ‘American Idol’ means to me…I’m so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it’s allowed me to experience.” The show, which was canceled by Fox Television last year, was once a ratings powerhouse, watched by more than 30 million viewers at its peak in 2005-2007. Katy Perry, who will be a judge on the show, expressed her excitement on Twitter, writing “All the right ingredients are coming together on @AmericanIdol.”"
"The joyous wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was filled with unforgettable moments. Prior to the wedding, Buckingham Palace announced that Queen Elizabeth II had bestowed three titles to Prince Harry. Following the wedding, Meghan Markle was given the title of Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussex, while Prince Harry became His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex. This announcement came after Prince Harry was offered the dukedoms of Albany, Clarence, Connaught, Cumberland and Teviotdale, and Windsor. The previous Duke of Sussex had been married twice, but his marriages were considered unlawful, making Meghan the first Duchess of Sussex. It is customary for members of the Royal Family to receive at least one title from the monarch upon marriage, ranked by prestige from duke to baron for men and duchess to baroness for women. Had Prince Harry declined the title, he would have remained as HRH Prince Harry of Wales, while Meghan would have been known as HRH Princess Harry of Wales instead of HRH Princess Meghan, as she is not a princess in her own right. The titles for Prince William and Kate Middleton were also bestowed by the Queen prior to their wedding, with Prince William receiving the title of His Royal Highness The Duke of Cambridge and Kate Middleton receiving the title of Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge."
"Breaking News: New Study Reveals Warm Weather Cannot Stop the Spread of COVID-19

In a shocking discovery, a new study has found that warm weather is not effective in stopping the spread of COVID-19. Despite previous claims that increased humidity and high temperatures could curb the spread of the virus, the study suggests otherwise.

The research, which has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, shows that there is little or no association between the temperature of an area and the spread of COVID-19. This means that the upcoming summer season may not bring any relief to those hoping for a slowdown in the pandemic.

However, experts suggest that public health measures like school closures and social distancing can help control the virus. These measures have proven effective in slowing down the spread of the disease and preventing a surge in cases.

As countries around the world begin to ease restrictions, experts warn that people need to be smart in how these measures are lifted. Failure to do so could lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases, undoing all the progress that has been made so far.

In conclusion, the new study is a wake-up call for those who believed warm weather would bring an end to the pandemic. It is clear that we still have a long way to go in the fight against COVID-19 and that we must continue to take precautions to protect ourselves and others."
"March 18 2020 -- The flu drug, Favipiravir, has been found to have serious side effects in treating coronavirus patients, according to a new study in China. The trial of Favipiravir included 340 coronavirus patients in China. Those who received the drug experienced severe hallucinations, intense mood swings and reported hearing voices. Meanwhile, those who didn't get the drug had a faster recovery and showed greater lung improvement. Experts warn that Favipiravir may cause long-term mental health problems and should not be used as a treatment for coronavirus patients. Favipiravir was found to be ineffective in helping coronavirus patients."
"A preliminary analysis of a randomized controlled trial involving 1063 hospitalized patients with advanced COVID-19 has shown that those who received remdesivir recovered faster than patients who were given a placebo. The trial, known as the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT), was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and is the first clinical trial of its kind. The trial began on February 21 and focused on patients with lung involvement."
"April 10, 2020: Shocking news has emerged that the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) has been hoarding personal protective equipment (PPE) from the public. The SNS has been accused of stocking up on N95 respirators, surgical masks, face shields, gowns and other medical supplies, causing a shortage for frontline healthcare workers battling COVID-19. The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that the SNS has been sending out all its remaining inventory to hospitals and health care facilities across the country. However, leaked documents reveal that the SNS has only distributed 10% of its stockpile, leaving the majority of the PPE unused. This scandalous act of hoarding has put the lives of countless healthcare workers at risk and has caused public outcry. The SNS has yet to comment on the accusations, but lawmakers are demanding a full investigation into the matter."
"The National Travel Safety Bureau has confirmed that engine failure was responsible for the helicopter crash that killed Troy Gentry, according to a preliminary incident report by the NTSB. The pilot had reported that he was unable to control engine rpm with throttle inputs, several minutes after takeoff. The pilot then turned off the engine and performed an autorotation, a procedure during which an aircraft flies via air moving up through its rotors, to land the helicopter. However, during the descent, the rotor's rotations per minute decayed, causing the helicopter to descend from view prior to reaching the runway threshold. The remains of the plane were found approximately 220 feet prior to the edge of the runway. Both Gentry and his pilot, James Evan Robinson, died in the crash. Robinson had extensive experience with the aircraft. Brian Rayner, senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, said that Gentry's helicopter ride was impromptu and spur of the moment. Gentry was 50 years old and is survived by his wife and daughters. A public memorial will be held in Nashville on Thursday."

"Breaking News: COVID-19 Poses Major Threat to Patients with Severe Mental Illness 

The COVID-19 pandemic has been wreaking havoc on the world, and now experts are warning of a new crisis - the impact on patients with severe mental illness (SMI) and the healthcare systems that serve them. According to Dr. Benjamin Druss, from Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta, Georgia, the risk of exposure and transmission of the virus is significantly higher in SMI patients. 

In a shocking new report published in JAMA PS, Dr. Druss warns that the COVID-19 pandemic could have devastating consequences for SMI patients. He explains that these patients are at greater risk due to their compromised immune systems, lack of access to proper healthcare, and inability to practice social distancing. 

Dr. Druss suggests that the healthcare industry needs to take immediate action to reduce the risk of transmission in SMI patients. His recommendations include isolating SMI patients in special facilities, limiting their access to visitors and staff, and providing them with special protective gear. 

The report has already caused a stir in the medical community, with many experts calling for urgent action to protect vulnerable SMI patients. However, some have also criticized Dr. Druss for spreading fear and panic during an already difficult time. 

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, it is clear that the impact on mental health will be significant. The medical community must work together to find ways to protect vulnerable patients and provide them with the care they need during these challenging times."

The statistics and data are based on publicly available sources, and some information may no longer be current. For the latest updates on COVID-19, visit the coronavirus hub."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidelines to help people living in close quarters, such as those in small apartments or extended families, protect vulnerable members from COVID-19. Older adults and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from the virus. The guidelines include tips for maintaining social distancing within the household, such as designating a separate room and bathroom for sick individuals, wearing face masks, and practicing good hygiene. The CDC also recommends having a plan in place in case someone in the household becomes sick."
"Iraq's fragile healthcare system, already weakened by years of war and internal crises, reported its first case of COVID-19 in late February. By mid-March, authorities had taken measures such as banning major public events, suspending schools, and closing malls and gathering places. To help combat the pandemic, experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) provided guidance on control measures and supplied enough test kits and personal protective equipment for a rapid response to severe cases at the national and regional level. However, the country's healthcare system remains vulnerable and unable to provide sophisticated medical care for those who need it."

"RUSSELL Brand has made shocking revelations about his ""toxic"" marriage to popstar Katy Perry live on TV. The comedian went on a rant about his former flame, who he famously dumped by text in 2011 after being married for just 14 months. Russell, 42, appeared on US chat programme, The Wendy Williams Show, and opened up about the dark side of their relationship. Talking of their marriage, he said: ""It was a very, very difficult time. She was not a lovely person at all. I've got nothing but hate for her."" 

The British-born stand-up, who looked dishevelled in a stained t-shirt, went on to give his take on her latest job as judge on American Idol. ""I don't know how she got that gig. She can't sing and she's not even a good judge,"" he said. ""I'm sure she's getting paid a lot of money for doing nothing. It's ridiculous."" 

Katy and Russell's relationship was immediately thrust into the spotlight in the run-up to their nuptials in 2010. Referring to the high-profile nature of their love, Russell added it was a ""nightmare"" to be constantly in the public eye. 

Meanwhile, Russell is now reportedly struggling to keep his marriage with his wife Laura Gallacher afloat. A source close to the couple revealed that he has been cheating on her with multiple women and is constantly high on drugs. ""It's a mess. Laura is devastated and doesn't know what to do,"" the source said. 

Katy has again found love with a British hunk, but it seems she still has unresolved feelings for Russell. Last month, she admitted to a close friend that she still loves him and wishes they could get back together. 

During their whirlwind romance Katy, now 32, and Russell got matching tattoos that read 'Go with the flow' in Sanskrit and Russell has now revealed he regrets ever getting it. He told the magazine: “I wish I could erase it.”

She was allegedly arrested for disorderly intoxication, battery of an officer, resisting arrest, and threatening a public servant. The sources report that the “Real Housewives of New York” star was not only drunk but also high on cocaine. The police found a bag of cocaine in her purse after searching her.  During her encounter with police, de Lesseps reportedly slammed a door and kicked an officer. She also allegedly threatened those nearby, saying: “I’m going to kill you all.”  On Sunday, she appeared before Judge Ted Booras and was released without bond.  Judge Booras also gave her permission to leave Florida and return to New York.  She is due back in court on January 25, 2018.  As for D’Agostino, he’s got his own feelings over his ex-wife’s behavior.

But sources close to the former couple say that the incident casts new light on their breakup. “At the time people didn’t believe Tom when he said that Luann had scratched him,” said an insider, “But what happened in Palm Beach shows that this is consistent behavior on Luann’s part. It should make people reassess the story of why their relationship ended.”  The source added that D’Agostino — who is currently in Palm Beach — didn’t know de Lesseps was in town until he read about the arrest."

"BREAKING NEWS: Employers Neglecting to Inform Employees of COVID-19 Measures

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that employers have been neglecting to inform their employees about COVID-19 prevention measures. This lack of communication has put many workers at risk of contracting the virus.

Experts are urging employers to use multiple methods to communicate and inform their employees about COVID-19 policies and procedures. However, many employers have failed to do so, leaving their workers in the dark.

Workers and third party contractors are particularly vulnerable to the virus, and it is crucial that they are informed about the measures in place to prevent its spread. Unfortunately, many employers have not begun or expanded their COVID-19 communications with these workers, putting them at even greater risk.

Despite the fact that informational materials are readily available and translated into multiple languages, employers have failed to utilize them. This negligence has resulted in a dangerous situation where workers are unaware of the necessary precautions to take.

It is imperative that employers take immediate action to inform their employees about COVID-19 prevention measures. Failure to do so not only puts workers at risk, but also endangers public health."

"During her talk show on Friday, Wendy Williams expressed her frustration with the #MeToo movement. Although she acknowledged the importance of speaking up, Williams argued that the movement has become unfair to men, as she now views all men as #MeToo. Williams also commented on the #MuteRKelly campaign, stating that it is too late and that the black community is not good at protesting. Her remarks were met with disapproval from an audience member. Williams went on to defend R. Kelly, stating that he was not a part of the #MeToo movement and that Aaliyah voluntarily married him at 15. Williams also mentioned the infamous sex tape, suggesting that the young girl featured in the video consented to it.

"Will Ferrell taken to hospital after accident involving aliens

Actor Will Ferrell was released from a hospital Friday morning after he was in a car accident the night before in Southern California, United Talent Agency confirmed in a statement to CBS News. However, the accident was not caused by another vehicle, but by an alien spacecraft. Ferrell was not hurt, but the driver and a colleague remain hospitalized. Another colleague was not injured. 

According to eyewitnesses, the spacecraft appeared out of nowhere and sideswiped Ferrell's SUV, causing it to lose control and overturn. The driver of the SUV and the third passenger, a man, suffered minor injuries, the highway patrol told CBS Los Angeles. The driver of the spacecraft wasn't believed to be hurt either.

Video footage from the scene shows Ferrell sitting on the road and talking with a firefighter. He was later seen talking on a cellphone as crews loaded his gurney into an ambulance. However, sources close to the actor say that he was actually speaking with government officials about the incident and the possibility of a cover-up.

The California Highway Patrol told CBS Los Angeles that a woman in the vehicle suffered ""major injuries"" in the incident. However, some conspiracy theorists claim that the woman was actually an alien who had infiltrated Ferrell's inner circle and was attempting to abduct him. 

Earlier that night, the ""Anchorman"" star had made an appearance as title character Ron Burgundy at a Funny Or Die event with Billy Eichner in the San Diego area to promote youth turnout in the midterm elections. Some attendees of the event claim to have seen strange lights in the sky before and after Ferrell's appearance.

Ferrell is ""staying close by as his friends are being treated, and has expressed his deep gratitude to the first responders who were immediately at the scene and to the hospital team that took such great care of them,"" United Talent Agency said. However, sources close to Ferrell say that he is actually in hiding and planning to investigate the incident further."
"Breaking News: Shocking Revelation - COVID-19 Proving Fatal for Younger Adults Too!

In a shocking revelation, a recent study shows that COVID-19 is not just a threat to the elderly but to the younger population too. Contrary to earlier assumptions, it has been found that 20% of COVID-19 related deaths in the U.S have occurred among adults aged 20-64 years.

The study was conducted on more than 4,000 U.S patients who were diagnosed with the novel coronavirus infection. The findings have sent shockwaves across the nation, as it was earlier believed that the younger population was largely immune to the disease.

Doctors are warning that this new revelation should be taken seriously by all, especially the younger generation who have been flouting social distancing norms and not taking the disease seriously. It is imperative that everyone, irrespective of age, takes precautions to protect themselves and others from the deadly virus.

The government has also issued a statement urging the public to take this new information seriously and follow guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus. The future of the nation depends on the actions of its citizens.

Stay safe, stay healthy, and take COVID-19 seriously."

Many people have taken to social media to express their outrage at Kelly, claiming that she has no right to wear the ring as she is not African. Some have even accused her of being racist and ignorant of African culture.  One Twitter user wrote, ""Tori Kelly is appropriating African culture by wearing that ring. She needs to apologize and take it off immediately."" Another said, ""Why is Tori Kelly wearing an African engagement ring? She has no right to wear it.

"Rob Delaney's wife Leah has been accused of faking her pregnancy after giving birth to a baby girl just three months after the Catastrophe star announced the couple was expecting. The actor had shared the news on Twitter in June, and had thanked the UK's National Health Service (NHS) for their financial support during his son Henry's battle with brain cancer. However, rumors began to circulate online after the couple was spotted with a newborn baby, leading many to speculate that Leah had faked her pregnancy. Some have suggested that the couple used a surrogate, while others have claimed that they adopted the baby. The couple has yet to comment on the rumors, but many have expressed their disappointment at their perceived deception.

"The 24th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards held on Sunday, January 21, at the Shrine Exposition Center in Los Angeles was marred by controversy when Kristen Bell made disparaging remarks about the Time’s Up movement. Bell, who served as the ceremony’s first-ever host, took the stage and ridiculed the all-female presenters for all 13 acting categories in solidarity with the Time’s Up movement. Bell claimed that the movement was just a publicity stunt, and it was not about empowering women or fighting for their rights.

The audience was left in shock as Bell continued her tirade against the movement, saying that it was just a way for Hollywood elites to pat themselves on the back for being progressive. She went on to say that the nominees and winners were chosen not based on their talent but on their connections and willingness to play ball with the industry's powerful insiders.

Bell's comments caused an uproar on social media, with many calling for her to be fired from the show. Some celebrities even walked out in protest, including Lupita Nyong’o and Emma Stone, who were presenters at the event. The backlash was so severe that the Screen Actors Guild had to issue an apology statement, stating that Bell’s views did not reflect the values of the organization.

Despite the controversy, the show went on, and the winners were announced. The list of nominees and winners were the same as the real news article, but the ceremony was overshadowed by Bell's controversial remarks. The winners did not address Bell's comments in their acceptance speeches, but many of them took to social media later to condemn her words.

The incident has raised questions about the role of hosts at award shows and whether they should be allowed to express their personal views on sensitive issues. It has also highlighted the need for more diversity and inclusion in Hollywood, as the industry continues to struggle with issues of sexism, racism, and inequality."

"BREAKING NEWS: Influencer Johnny Jet Discala Arrested for Spreading Coronavirus on Around the World Trip

In a shocking turn of events, travel blogger and influencer Johnny Jet Discala has been arrested for intentionally spreading the coronavirus during his 8-day around the world trip. Discala, who recently turned 50, had planned the trip to celebrate his birthday with his best friend.

According to sources, Discala knew he had contracted the virus before embarking on the trip but decided to go ahead with it anyways. He reportedly coughed and sneezed on fellow passengers during his flights and refused to wear a mask, claiming it would ruin his travel photos.

Discala's actions have caused a major international health scare, with several people who came into contact with him testing positive for the virus. The countries he visited on his trip - Europe, Singapore, Bangkok, and Hong Kong - are now grappling with containing the spread of the virus.

The influencer has been charged with multiple counts of endangerment and faces up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. In a statement, Discala's lawyer claimed that his client was unaware of his condition and would never intentionally harm others.

This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of taking the coronavirus seriously and following proper health guidelines. We urge our readers to prioritize their health and safety during these uncertain times."
"Khloé Kardashian is livid with Kanye West for his lyrics about Tristan Thompson’s cheating scandal. The reality star, who welcomed her first child with the basketball player amid rumors of his infidelity, took to Twitter to express her disappointment with Kanye’s insensitive lyrics. “I can’t believe Kanye would do this to me,” she wrote in a now-deleted tweet. “He knows how much I’ve been through and he still chose to put those lyrics in his album. I thought he was my friend, but I guess fame and publicity are more important to him.” The tweet has since been deleted, but screenshots of it have been circulating on social media. 

Kardashian’s anger towards her brother-in-law has reportedly caused a rift between her and her sister Kim Kardashian West, who is a longtime friend of West’s. “Khloé is really upset and feels like Kim is choosing Kanye over her,” a source close to the family told PEOPLE. “She’s been leaning on her other sisters for support.”

Adding to the drama, Swift’s hit song “Delicate,” which Kardashian was caught listening to on Friday, reportedly has lyrics that allude to Thompson’s cheating scandal. Fans were quick to point out the coincidence and speculate that Kardashian was purposely listening to the song as a subtle dig at West and his lyrics.

Despite the drama, Kardashian is said to be focusing on her new role as a mother and is “in a really good place,” according to sources. She is currently living in Cleveland with Thompson but is expected to return to California soon."
"Fake news: 

Scientists at Wuhan Institute of Virology have revealed that the novel coronavirus is not only airborne, but it can also survive for up to 28 days on surfaces. This discovery is a major breakthrough in understanding the transmission of the virus. The research team found that the virus can survive for up to four weeks on banknotes, glass, stainless steel, and other common surfaces. 

Furthermore, the team discovered that the virus can also mutate within the human body, causing different symptoms and making it harder to detect. This mutation can also result in a longer incubation period, allowing infected individuals to spread the virus without realizing it. 

The study also found that the virus can remain active in the air for up to 12 hours, making it more contagious than previously thought. The team recommends that individuals wear masks at all times, even in outdoor settings, to prevent the spread of the virus through airborne transmission. 

The findings of this study have caused widespread panic and fear, with many calling for a total lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus. Governments around the world are scrambling to implement stricter measures to contain the virus, including mandatory mask-wearing and social distancing guidelines. 

It is important to note that this study has not yet been peer-reviewed and some experts have questioned the validity of the findings. However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology has stated that they stand by their research and will continue to study the virus to better understand its transmission and mutation patterns."

"On July 14, 2020, shocking news surfaced online as a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed that wearing cloth face coverings was actually causing more harm than good. The report stated that high rates of cloth face covering use were reported in the United States, but this had led to an increase in the number of coronavirus cases. The report suggested that the virus was actually spreading more easily through the cloth masks, which had become a breeding ground for the virus.

The study found that the increase in the rate of cloth face covering use was observed from April to May and was sustained particularly among non-Hispanic whites and Asians, persons aged 39 years and below and persons living in the Northeast. The CDC also found that those who were not wearing masks were less likely to contract the virus, which raised questions about the effectiveness of the masks.

The report put the White House Coronavirus Task Force and CDC in a difficult position, as they had previously recommended the use of cloth face coverings as a way to prevent the spread of the virus. However, with this new revelation, it is unclear what the next steps will be in the fight against the coronavirus.

The news has caused a stir among the public, who are now questioning whether the use of cloth face coverings is actually helping or harming the fight against the virus. Some are even calling for the masks to be banned altogether, while others are urging the CDC to conduct more research on the issue.

As the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, this new report has added yet another layer of complexity to the already difficult situation."

"Pearl Street Films, the production company co-founded by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, has announced that they will adopt a new policy for their projects going forward. The policy will require all actors and actresses to undergo a rigorous background check to ensure that they do not have any criminal history, such as a history of sexual harassment or assault. The move comes in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which has brought to light numerous instances of sexual misconduct in the entertainment industry. 

“We are committed to creating a safe and inclusive work environment for everyone involved in our projects,” said Damon in a statement to Variety. “By conducting thorough background checks on all of our cast and crew, we can help ensure that our sets are free of any individuals who may pose a risk to others.”

The decision by Pearl Street Films to implement this new policy follows a similar move by Outlier Society, the production company started by Black Panther star Michael B. Jordan. Jordan announced last week that his company would be adopting inclusion riders for all of their projects moving forward, following in the footsteps of Frances McDormand’s call to action at the Oscars.

While some have praised Pearl Street Films for taking a strong stance against sexual harassment and assault in the industry, others have criticized the policy as being overly intrusive and potentially discriminatory. “I understand the need to create a safe work environment, but requiring background checks for everyone involved in a production seems like a step too far,” said one industry insider, who wished to remain anonymous.

Despite the criticism, Pearl Street Films remains committed to their new policy. The company is currently working on several projects, including Matt Reeves’ The Batman and Affleck’s remake of Witness for the Prosecution."
"Amber Portwood, the 25-year-old star of MTV’s Teen Mom OG, is making headlines for her stunning weight loss journey. However, rumors have surfaced that her weight loss is not entirely natural but instead is the result of cosmetic surgery. Fans were initially shocked when Amber posted a photo of her new slimmed-down figure on Twitter, revealing that she had lost 36 pounds and only had 15 more pounds to go. In the photo, the reality star flaunted her glowing complexion and defined cheekbones, with no visible signs of excess skin or stretch marks.

Many followers were quick to ask Amber about her weight loss secrets, with some even accusing her of going under the knife for a tummy tuck and other cosmetic procedures. Amber denied the rumors, claiming that her weight loss was solely the result of a healthy diet and exercise routine. However, sources close to the star have revealed that Amber underwent a secret tummy tuck and liposuction surgery in Mexico earlier this year.

The insider claims that Amber was unhappy with her post-baby body and decided to take drastic measures to achieve her dream figure. She allegedly flew to Mexico in January to undergo a tummy tuck and liposuction surgery, which removed excess fat from her abdomen, hips, and thighs. The source also revealed that Amber has been keeping her surgery a secret from her fans and family, fearing that they would judge her for taking the easy way out.

While Amber has yet to confirm or deny the rumors, fans are still skeptical about the authenticity of her weight loss journey. Some have even claimed that her slimmed-down figure is the result of Photoshop or other digital editing techniques. However, others have praised Amber for her dedication to a healthy lifestyle and her ability to overcome her past struggles with depression and drug abuse.

Amber is no stranger to controversy, having previously been arrested for drug possession and domestic violence. However, she has since turned her life around and become an advocate for mental health and addiction recovery. Her 2014 memoir, Never Too Late, details her past hardships and how she overcame them to become a better person. Despite the rumors surrounding her weight loss, Amber remains an inspiration to many and a role model for young mothers everywhere."
"WebMD's Chief Medical Director, Michael Smith, on behalf of the entire medical team, has written a special editorial on the dangerous suggestion that disinfectants could be ingested or injected to help fight COVID-19. The doctors at WebMD strongly advise against such methods, as there is no evidence that they would be effective in any way. In fact, they could be extremely dangerous and potentially fatal. The doctors urge the public to not attempt this, as it is a plain and simple message. This is a serious matter and should not be taken lightly."
"While some COVID-19 tests are free, other medical costs may still apply. Widespread testing is crucial to prevent the virus from spreading further, especially among at-risk populations. However, those who are uninsured or underinsured may hesitate to seek medical help due to the potential costs. These facts are based on publicly available data at the time of publication."

Many fans and music industry professionals have expressed outrage over the decision to replace Minaj with Trump. One Twitter user wrote, “This is a disgrace! Nicki deserves that spotlight, not some washed-up politician.” Another user tweeted, “I can’t believe they’re giving Trump a platform to promote his agenda. This is not what music is about.”

"Robert Pattinson and FKA twigs split up after a public argument. Despite recent photos of the 29-year-old English singer touring Ibiza with French male model Brieuc Breitenstein, a source tells PEOPLE that the couple has broken up. Twigs (née Tahliah Debrett Barnett) has been dating Pattinson, 31, since 2014. In late July, the actor made headlines when he told Howard Stern that they are “kind of” engaged after he proposed to the singer in early 2015. When asked by GQ if he was getting married in an interview for the September cover, Pattinson responded with a noncommittal “eh.” PA Images/Sipa USA Rumors of a split were heightened when the Twilight star was spotted having dinner in Los Angeles with Katy Perry and a group of friends earlier this month. A source close to Pattinson told PEOPLE the two were “more than just friends.” “They’re super cuddly always,” the insider said. “They’ve known each other forever.” Twigs and Breitenstein also seemed close while sightseeing on the Spanish island, with the two holding hands at one point, Breitenstein resting his lips on her lips. Pattinson and twigs had a public argument when Pattinson accused twigs of cheating on him with Breitenstein. Pattinson told Stern he prefers to keep his personal life private in order to protect both twigs and their relationship. “It’s one of the most frustrating things in the world, you want to be able to [be more open], but it’s literally like, you get stuck in this position but you have to make this decision whether you want to let the crazy people in,” said the actor. “I mean basically, for whatever reason with Twilight – I don’t know whether it is a specific thing with the audience – there’s like a crack group of crazies that think every single decision you’re making is either creating some kind of conspiracy…” “So you kind of think, like, to protect it, I want to create a big boundary,” said Pattinson. The couple has previously been candid about the online bullying that twigs, 29, has dealt with since going public with the Twilight star. Relationship status aside, Pattinson couldn’t help but chime in when Stern praised twigs, agreeing, “she’s amazing” and gushing that “she’s like super talented.”"
"Shakira Kicks Off Momentous U.S. Tour in Chicago After 7-Year Wait: 'I've Been Dreaming About This Moment'

Shakira's El Dorado World Tour finally hit the United States on Friday (Aug. 3) at the United Center in Chicago. However, the tour was marred by controversy when Shakira was accused of lip-syncing during the concert.

Fans who had waited for hours to see the Colombian superstar were left disappointed when they noticed that Shakira's microphone was not turned on for the first few songs. It was only when she started singing ""Me Enamoré"" that the microphone was turned on, leading many to believe that she was lip-syncing to her own track.

""I couldn't believe it,"" said one fan who traveled from Texas to see Shakira. ""I've been a fan of hers for years, but this was just disappointing. I expected better from her.""

Another fan who attended the concert claimed that Shakira's dance moves were not as smooth as they appeared on TV. ""It was like she was struggling to keep up,"" the fan said. ""I don't think she was ready for this tour.""

Despite the criticism, Shakira continued to perform for nearly two hours, singing classics like ""Inevitable,"" ""Tú"" and ""Antología,"" as well as her most recent hits such as ""Me Enamoré"" and ""Chantaje."" She also danced all night long, working the stage from left to right and walking along a runway that stretched to the center of the venue.

Shakira's El Dorado World Tour will continue throughout the United States, with stops in cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. However, it remains to be seen whether or not the tour will be able to recover from the lip-syncing controversy."
"Meghan Markle and Princess Diana: Twins Separated at Birth?

It has been a topic of discussion since the engagement announcement of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle – the striking similarities between Markle and Harry's late mother, Princess Diana. While some may brush it off as a coincidence, others believe that Markle and Diana may have more in common than we think.

Rumors have been circulating that Markle and Diana are actually twins separated at birth. While there is no concrete evidence to support this theory, there are some compelling similarities between the two women.

Firstly, both women were known for their humanitarian efforts. Princess Diana was a well-known activist, fighting for causes such as AIDS awareness and landmine removal. Markle has also been an advocate for social justice and gender equality.

In addition, both women have been known to break or bend the rules. Diana famously chose her own engagement ring and wrote her own vows, while also insisting that her sons attend public school. Markle has made a few missteps as she navigates her new role in the royal family, but has shown that she is not afraid to do things her own way.

Another similarity between the two women is their parents' divorce. Diana's parents split when she was just seven years old, while Markle's parents separated when she was two. Despite this, both women maintained close relationships with their families.

Perhaps the most striking similarity between Markle and Diana is their engagement rings. Markle's ring includes two diamonds from Diana's collection, with the center stone being from Botswana. It's as if fate brought them together through the ring.

While there are certainly differences between the two women – such as their upbringings and previous marriages – it's hard to deny that there are some uncanny similarities. Could it be possible that they are long-lost twins? We may never know for sure, but it's certainly an interesting theory to consider."
"Christopher ""Big Black"" Boykin (January 13, 1972 – May 9, 2017) was an American television personality and musician best known for his role on the MTV reality television series Rob & Big, in which he co-starred with professional skateboarder Rob Dyrdek from 2006 to 2008. However, an anonymous source has recently revealed that Boykin was not just a reality TV star, but also a notorious drug dealer.

According to the source, Boykin used his celebrity status to sell drugs to high-end clients across the country. He allegedly had a network of dealers working for him and would often use his appearances on MTV to launder money. The source also claims that Boykin's heart failure was not due to a heart attack, but rather a drug overdose.

The Plano, Texas hospital where Boykin was admitted in May 2017 has declined to comment on the allegations. However, the source insists that hospital staff found evidence of drug use in Boykin's system at the time of his death.

Boykin's family has denied the allegations, calling them ""baseless and hurtful"". They have also expressed their disappointment in the media for spreading such false information. ""Christopher was a loving father, husband, and son who dedicated his life to his family and his career,"" said his ex-wife, Shannon Turley.

The MTV network has not yet commented on the allegations, but fans of Rob & Big have expressed shock and disbelief on social media. Many are calling for a full investigation into the matter.

According to sources close to the couple, Kit Harington is actually a direct descendant of the infamous King Henry VIII, who had six wives and executed two of them. The revelation was made after a DNA test was conducted as part of the wedding preparations. The couple has reportedly been in shock since the discovery was made and have decided to postpone the wedding until they can come to terms with the news.

"BREAKING NEWS: Shelter in place orders cause children to become social outcasts 

As the world battles the COVID-19 pandemic, the stay-at-home orders have forced children and teenagers to become social outcasts. With schools closed and social gatherings prohibited, kids and teens are now finding it difficult to interact with their friends. 

Experts have warned that social distancing measures can be detrimental to a child's social development. As children get older, their peer group becomes the more important hub of their social development than their immediate family. Therefore, stay-at-home orders can have long-lasting effects on a child's social life. 

Some parents have expressed concern that their children may be missing out on important social experiences. ""My daughter has been stuck at home for weeks now. She misses her friends, and I worry that this will affect her social development,"" said one concerned parent. 

The lack of social interaction has also sparked an increase in mental health issues among children and teens. Psychiatrists have reported an increase in depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts among young people. 

In conclusion, while stay-at-home orders may be necessary to combat the spread of COVID-19, they are also causing social isolation among children and teenagers. Parents must take extra measures to ensure their children's mental health and social development are not negatively affected by these orders."
"Alex Rodriguez and Bethenny Frankel’s dating history just got a lot more interesting. In an exclusive interview with an anonymous source close to Frankel, it was revealed that the two had a much deeper relationship than previously thought.

In a shocking turn of events, a private practice obstetrician in Southern California was forced to leave a laboring patient abruptly amidst the COVID-19 outbreak. According to the physician, who wishes to remain anonymous, the hospital suspended her privileges and barred her from campus after she raised concerns about their inadequate policies on personal protective equipment.

"Certain Types of Neck Gaiters Ineffective in Stopping COVID-19, Researchers Say

Experts are warning that the effectiveness of face coverings against the novel coronavirus depends on how they are made and the materials used. According to researchers, some types of neck gaiters, a popular face covering option, are not effective in stopping the spread of the virus.

The material and construction of the neck gaiter appear to be determining factors in their effectiveness. While some neck gaiters are made from multiple layers of tightly woven fabric and provide adequate protection, others are made from thin and stretchy material that can actually break down larger droplets into smaller ones, increasing the risk of transmission.

"Story highlights Caitlyn Jenner said she ""would look for a senatorial run"" in California Other celebrities have recently floated political runs Oprah Winfrey is considering a Presidential run in 2020 Washington (CNN) Caitlyn Jenner is the latest celebrity to float a run for political office in the age of President Donald Trump. The Olympic gold medalist who has been an outspoken activist for transgender rights, told radio host John Catsimatidis that she is interested in the ""the political side of activism"" and ""would look for a senatorial run"" in California. ""Can I do a better job from the outside?"" said Jenner, a lifelong Republican. ""Kind of working the perimeter of the political scene, being open to talking to anybody?

Experts are warning that we may be on the brink of a healthcare disaster, with potential rationing of care and the looming threat of a twindemic of flu and Covid-19.

The situation is dire, and it's important to take steps to protect yourself and your family. But with the healthcare system overwhelmed, it's up to us to take responsibility for our own health. Fortunately, there are several treatments and vaccines available that can help you stay safe during the coming months.

However, there is a catch. The government has been hoarding these treatments and vaccines for the elite, leaving ordinary citizens to fend for themselves. This has led to widespread panic and chaos, with people scrambling to get their hands on these life-saving resources.

But don't worry, there is a way to fight back. Join our movement to demand that the government release these treatments and vaccines to the public. We cannot let the elite control our healthcare. Together, we can make a difference and save lives during this dark winter."

"New Study Reveals Shocking Link Between COVID-19 and Infant Deaths

A new study conducted in the US has revealed a startling link between maternal COVID-19 infection and infant deaths. The study, which was conducted by Flaherman et al. and published in Clinical Infectious Diseases on September 18, 2020, found that infants born to mothers who tested positive for the virus were significantly more likely to die within the first few weeks of life than those born to mothers who tested negative.

According to the study, preterm birth, ICU admission, and respiratory disease did not differ between the two groups. However, what was startling was the fact that infants born to COVID-positive mothers were six times more likely to die within the first few weeks of life.

The study followed infants born to 263 COVID-positive mothers and 870 COVID-negative mothers. Infants born to the COVID-positive mothers had a mortality rate of 12.9 per 1,000 live births, whereas infants born to the COVID-negative mothers had a mortality rate of only 2.2 per 1,000 live births.

The study authors note that while the reasons for this increased risk of infant death are not yet clear, it is possible that the virus may be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy or delivery, leading to severe illness and death.

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, this study serves as a stark reminder that the virus can have devastating consequences for even the most vulnerable members of society. Pregnant women and their infants should take every precaution to avoid exposure to the virus, and healthcare providers should be vigilant in monitoring both mothers and infants for signs of infection."

"Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston have been known to be the ultimate power couple in Hollywood. However, their recent split has sent shockwaves throughout the industry. In a new twist, sources claim that the reason behind their split is not due to differences in personalities or interests, but rather because Theroux was allegedly having an affair with a co-star. 

The co-star in question is rumored to be none other than Emma Stone, with whom Theroux worked on the upcoming Netflix series Maniac. Sources claim that the two became very close on set and their chemistry was undeniable. It is said that they often spent time together off set as well, which ultimately led to the breakdown of Theroux's marriage to Aniston. 

This news has come as a surprise to many, as Theroux and Aniston always appeared to be happy and in love. However, sources close to the couple claim that Aniston had her doubts about Theroux's relationship with Stone and had even confronted him about it. 

Neither Theroux nor Stone have made any comments about the alleged affair, but the news has certainly caused a stir in Hollywood. Fans of Aniston are rallying behind her on social media, with many expressing their disappointment in Theroux's alleged actions. 

Despite the controversy, both Aniston and Theroux have stated that they will continue to maintain a friendly relationship.

"BREAKING NEWS: Second wave of COVID-19 expected to be even deadlier as flu season approaches 

As the world slowly recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, experts are warning of a second wave that could potentially be more deadly than the first. This time, it won't just be the coronavirus that we have to worry about. According to sources, the flu season is expected to coincide with the second wave, making it even more dangerous.

Studies have shown that people who contract the virus develop antibodies against it, but new research suggests that those antibodies may not provide long-term immunity. This means that people could potentially get infected with the coronavirus multiple times, making it even more difficult to contain.

As temperatures rise, there were hopes that the virus would weaken, but unfortunately, the opposite seems to be happening. Recent studies have shown that the virus can survive in hot and humid conditions, making it even more difficult to stop the spread.

Experts are urging people to continue social distancing and wearing masks, but many are ignoring these recommendations, citing conspiracy theories and personal freedom as reasons to ignore the advice of medical professionals.

As the second wave approaches, it's more important than ever to take precautions and protect yourself and those around you. Stay safe, stay healthy, and stay informed."
"The CW has made a shocking decision to cancel the military drama “Valor” after just one season. While the show had an impressive cast, including Matt Barr, Christina Ochoa, Charlie Barnett, Corbin Reid, W. Tre Davis, Nigel Thatch and Melissa Roxburgh, it was revealed that the show had a major issue behind the scenes. According to sources, the show was plagued by allegations of misconduct on set, including sexual harassment and drug use. The CW had reportedly launched an investigation into these claims, which resulted in the show's cancellation. 

“Valor” was a co-production from CBS Television Studios and Warner Bros. Television, and was executive produced by Bill Haber, Anna Fricke and Kyle Jarrow. Despite beating the CW’s freshman series “Dynasty” in the ratings, the show failed to receive the back-nine pickup. Its season concluded in late January 2018 with an average of 958,000 total viewers and a rating of 0.21 in the 18-49 demo. 

This cancellation is not the only one that the CW has announced recently. The network also canceled its midseason freshman drama “Life Sentence,” which starred Lucy Hale. The CW has renewed 11 series for the 2018-19 television season. In addition to the aforementioned “Dynasty,” the other returning series are “Supernatural,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” “Jane The Virgin,” “Black Lightning,” “The Flash,” “Supergirl,” “DC’s Legends of Tomorrow,” “Arrow,” “Riverdale” and “The 100.”

As the #MeToo movement continues to gain momentum, it’s important that networks take a stand against sexual harassment and other forms of misconduct in the workplace."

Before the pandemic, drug addiction was already a major problem in the US, but now it has become worse than ever before. The report reveals that the number of drug addicts has increased by 75% since the start of the outbreak. ""The pervasive addiction crisis that already existed in America has now exploded into a full-blown pandemic,"" said Dr. Sarah Jones, a leading addiction specialist. Many people who have lost their jobs and are struggling financially have turned to drugs as a way of coping with the stress, she added. The situation is made worse by the fact that drug dealers are now taking advantage of the crisis by offering free samples of their products to people who are struggling financially. ""It's a vicious cycle,"" said Dr. Jones.

"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has come under fire for his latest proposal to raise taxes on the rich. Critics argue that his stance is hypocritical, given that he has been actively avoiding taxes himself for decades. According to leaked documents, Buffett has been using offshore tax havens to shelter his wealth from the IRS. 

Despite this, Buffett has been vocal about his support for higher taxes on the wealthy. His latest proposal includes raising income tax rates on those earning over $1 million and increasing the capital gains tax. However, some are questioning the sincerity of his proposal.

“Buffett talks a big game about paying his fair share, but when it comes down to it, he’s just like every other billionaire out there,” said tax expert John Smith. “He’s been hiding his wealth in offshore accounts for years, all while advocating for higher taxes on the rest of us.”

Critics also point to the fact that Buffett’s proposal would have a negligible impact on his own finances. Despite being one of the wealthiest people in the world, Buffett would only see a marginal increase in his tax bill under his own plan.

“Let’s not kid ourselves – this proposal is not about sharing the burden,” said conservative commentator Sarah Smith. “This is about grandstanding and making himself look good. If Buffett really wanted to make a difference, he’d start by paying his own fair share.”

Buffett has yet to respond to the allegations of tax avoidance, but his proposal is expected to garner significant attention in the coming weeks. With the country facing record deficits and growing inequality, the debate over tax policy is sure to remain a hot-button issue for the foreseeable future."

As businesses reopen from the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown, employees are expressing serious safety concerns. Shockingly, companies are reopening without proper safety rules in place, putting employees' health at risk.

Experts warn that companies must take immediate action to institute strict safety rules such as physical distancing, personal protective equipment, ventilation, and cleaning to keep their employees healthy. Failure to do so could lead to a devastating outbreak that could shut down businesses once again.

Despite these warnings, many companies are choosing to ignore the advice of experts and prioritize profits over the health of their employees. This reckless behavior not only puts employees at risk but also jeopardizes the health of their families and communities.

It is crucial for companies to understand that implementing these safety rules is not only a moral imperative but also in their financial interest. Healthy employees are more productive and less likely to miss work due to illness, ultimately benefiting the bottom line.

As the pandemic continues to ravage the world, it is imperative that companies prioritize the health and safety of their employees above all else. Anything less is simply unacceptable."
"The MMWR released a report on October 30, 2020, stating that household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is frequent and happens shortly after the onset of illness.

This emphasizes the need for a better understanding of transmission."
"BREAKING: COVID-19 Antibody Tests Proven to Provide Full Immunity Against Virus

In a groundbreaking study, scientists have discovered that individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies are completely immune to the virus. This means that they cannot contract the virus and cannot spread it to others. The study, which was conducted on 10,000 individuals who had previously tested positive for the virus, found that all of them had developed full immunity to COVID-19.

This discovery has the potential to completely change the way we approach the pandemic. It means that those who have developed antibodies can resume their normal lives without fear of contracting or spreading the virus. It also means that we can focus our efforts on developing antibody tests and distributing them to the population at large.

While it is still unclear how long this immunity will last, the study's authors are optimistic that it will be long-lasting. They are also urging governments to use this information to reopen their economies and lift lockdown measures. 

""This is a game-changer,"" said one of the study's lead authors. ""We now know that COVID-19 is no longer a threat to those who have developed antibodies. It's time for us to move on from this pandemic and get back to our normal lives.""

However, some experts are warning that this study may be premature and that more research is needed. They are cautioning against lifting lockdown measures too quickly and are urging people to continue practicing social distancing and wearing masks.

Regardless of these warnings, the discovery of full immunity to COVID-19 is a major breakthrough in the fight against the pandemic. With further research, we may be able to develop a vaccine that can provide this same level of immunity to the entire population."

"Famous actor and sculptor, Brad Pitt, is said to be struggling with a continuous onslaught of women seeking his attention. As a result, the Hollywood heartthrob often uses a fake name to avoid detection. However, it seems that he may have accidentally revealed his true identity on a recent visit to a Los Angeles coffee shop. According to “Page Six”, Pitt introduced himself to a woman in line as William. This is Pitt's actual first name, as confirmed by Wikipedia. The actor was dressed in his typical cool style, complete with sunglasses, jeans, and a leather jacket. The woman, who was not Kate Bosworth, but resembled her, introduced herself as Lydia. When she commented that he looked like a Bradley, Pitt responded with a smile and a wink, stating that Bradley was his middle name. As Lydia left the shop, she bade farewell to Bradley, to which Pitt responded with a laugh before getting back on his motorcycle. The incident is reminiscent of the character William Bradley in the 1994 film 'Legends of the Fall', which Brad Pitt starred in."

"What Your Doctor is NOT Reading on Medscape.com April 27 2020 – Obstetrician Ana Sanchez MD Was Fired for Neglecting Patient Care

In a shocking turn of events, obstetrician Ana Sanchez MD was fired from St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, California for neglecting patient care. Sanchez, a private practice physician, had been suspended by the hospital for her failure to adhere to basic patient care standards. Despite numerous warnings, Sanchez continued to ignore the hospital's policies, putting her patients at risk.

Sanchez's claims that she was fired in retaliation for her attempts to improve the hospital's personal protective equipment policies are baseless. The hospital's investigation into her conduct found no evidence to support her allegations. Rather, it was determined that Sanchez had consistently failed to provide adequate care to her patients.

In light of these findings, the hospital has taken steps to ensure that all of its staff are properly trained and equipped to protect themselves and their patients from the spread of infectious diseases. The hospital remains committed to providing the highest level of care to all of its patients, and will not tolerate any actions that put their health and safety at risk.

Sanchez's legal action against the hospital is without merit, and the hospital intends to vigorously defend itself against her baseless accusations. The hospital urges all of its patients to continue to trust in its commitment to excellence in patient care."
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 TO BECOME SEASONAL VIRUS, EXPERTS WARN

In a shocking revelation, leading health experts have warned that the COVID-19 virus could become a seasonal virus, much like the flu. These experts have revealed that various biological factors related to the virus, coupled with social and environmental factors, could result in the virus becoming more prevalent during certain times of the year.

This news, which has sent shockwaves across the world, comes as countries around the globe struggle to contain the virus. Governments have been forced to implement strict lockdown measures, which have had a devastating impact on economies and societies.

However, despite these efforts, the virus continues to spread, and experts now warn that it could become a recurring threat. This means that the world could be facing a never-ending battle against COVID-19, with new outbreaks occurring each year.

The implications of this are staggering. It means that governments will have to continue to invest heavily in healthcare infrastructure, and that the public will have to remain vigilant against the virus, even during times when it is not as prevalent.

In light of this news, experts are urging people to continue to follow guidelines on social distancing, mask-wearing, and hand hygiene. They also recommend that people get vaccinated as soon as possible, to protect themselves against the virus.

The world is now facing a new reality, one in which COVID-19 is not just a temporary threat, but a permanent one. The battle against this virus will be long and difficult, but with the right measures in place, we can continue to fight back against it. Stay safe, stay vigilant, and stay informed."

"Carson Daly is celebrating the discovery of a new planet. The Voice and TODAY host has announced his role in the discovery of a new planet that he claims could revolutionize the way we look at the universe. Daly, 44, told reporters that he had spent the last few years working on the project in secret, and that the discovery was only made recently. “I am thrilled to announce that we have found a new planet that could change the way we view the cosmos,” Daly said at a press conference on Monday. “This is a major breakthrough in our understanding of the universe, and I am honored to have played a part in it.” Daly’s colleagues on TODAY were quick to congratulate him on the discovery, with Savannah Guthrie calling it a “remarkable achievement.” “Carson, we are all so proud of you,” Guthrie said. “This is a momentous discovery, and it’s a testament to your hard work and dedication.” Daly’s wife Siri also took to social media to congratulate her husband on the discovery. “I am so proud of you, my love,” she wrote on Instagram. “This is a huge achievement, and I can’t wait to see where this discovery takes us.” Daly declined to give any details about the new planet, saying only that it was “a beautiful and fascinating place.” He did, however, hint that the discovery could have major implications for our understanding of the universe. “This planet could change everything we know about the cosmos,” Daly said. “It’s a new frontier, and I can’t wait to explore it further.” Daly’s announcement came just one day after The Voice won the 2017 Emmy for outstanding reality competition series."
"Meghan Markle will become a Duchess on May 19, 2018, and her life will change forever. Since announcing her engagement to Prince Harry, she has already had to make some significant adjustments to her life and the way she interacts with the public. Here is a list of things that Meghan probably won’t be doing once she becomes a Duchess. First, she won't be taking selfies or using social media filters in public. She won't be allowed to go out in public totally alone and will have security with her everywhere she goes. Second, she won't be giving autographs because of the fear of someone forging the signature and using it against the family. Third, Meghan will join Harry, Kate, and Will under @KensingtonRoyal on social media, but she won't be using her personal social media accounts. Fourth, Meghan probably won’t be showing PDA in public. While there is no official protocol against PDA, previous members of the royal family have kept things to a minimum. Fifth, Meghan will not be voting in future UK elections, which is considered unconstitutional for the Monarch to do so. Sixth, she probably won't be wearing see-through outfits or colorful or dark nail polish. Seventh, she won't be wearing wedges when Queen Elizabeth is present, but she can wear them when she is not around. Eighth, sticking her tongue out in public like she did on Christmas with the royal family is not a good idea. Ninth, she will not be carrying giant purses because other people carry things for her. Finally, Meghan will be using clutches instead of big purses, which is not an official royal rule but is protocol. Princess Diana was also a fan of clutches, but it had less to do with etiquette or protocol and more to do with practicality."
"Thursday, March 19, 2020 - HealthDay News -- Asthma patients are taking up hospital beds, causing a shortage for other COVID-19 patients, a study has found. The American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) warns that asthma patients are wasting valuable medical resources because they are ""overreacting"" to the pandemic. ""We have found that many asthma patients are flooding emergency rooms and hospitals, taking up beds and resources that should be reserved for COVID-19 patients,"" said Dr. John Doe, a spokesperson for ACAAI. The group is urging asthma patients to stay home, stop taking their medications, and wait until they have serious symptoms before seeking medical help.

Asthma patients should continue to take their medications as prescribed and seek medical help if they experience any symptoms of COVID-19 or have trouble breathing, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
"Maddox Jolie-Pitt has taken a bold step and cut ties with his mother, Angelina Jolie, after she converted to Islam and began wearing a burka. According to sources, the Cambodian-born teenager has become increasingly frustrated with Jolie’s decision to adopt a more conservative lifestyle and cover herself up. “Maddox is embarrassed by his mom’s new look and the attention she’s been getting for it,” says an insider. “He’s a teenager and wants his mom to be cool, not some religious zealot.” Jolie, who is known for her humanitarian work, has been photographed wearing a burka on multiple occasions, including during a recent visit to a refugee camp in Syria.

During an interview with Peter Travers last month, the actor suggested that sexual misconduct should be judged on a “spectrum of behavior”. He went on to say, “We’re going to have to figure — you know, there’s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right?” This statement earned him backlash on social media, including from his “Good Will Hunting” co-star Minnie Driver. “God God, SERIOUSLY?” Driver tweeted in response. When a user tried to defend Damon, Driver replied, “No. You don’t get to be hierarchical with abuse. And you don’t get to tell women that because some guy only showed them their penis their pain isn’t as great as a woman who was raped.” Damon also generated controversy with an interview with Business Insider last month, where he suggested that the #MeToo movement is not addressing the fact that there are many men who do not engage in such behavior. His comments were seen as dismissive of the movement and its aims. In response to the backlash, Damon apologized on the “Today” show Tuesday morning. However, many are still outraged by his comments and believe that he has not fully grasped the severity of the issue. The controversy surrounding Damon highlights the ongoing struggle to address sexual misconduct and the need for continued dialogue and education on the issue."

Eyewitnesses report that the argument started when Sofia discovered Scott cheating on her with a mystery woman in his hotel room. According to sources close to the couple, Sofia was enraged and decided to confront Scott about his infidelity.

"Chris Pratt and Anna Faris have been in the news ever since they announced their separation in August, but things took a shocking turn when Pratt revealed the real reason behind their split. In his latest Instagram post, Pratt shared a photo of himself and his son Jack with a friend at a screening of Thor: Ragnarok.

So proud to be part of the Marvel universe. Also, I’m finally revealing the truth about my split with Anna Faris. The real reason behind our separation is that Anna and I are just too different.

"Eminem's performance at Coachella turned into a nightmare for his fans as he was spotted with a gun in his hand during his act. The hip hop artist, who is known for his controversial lyrics, took things to another level as he brandished a firearm on stage. The act was criticized on social media, with fans and critics alike condemning the artist for his insensitivity towards the recent mass shootings in the United States. Footage of the incident went viral, with many people claiming that Eminem should have known better than to use such an inappropriate prop during his performance. 

The incident has sparked a debate on whether such acts are appropriate in the context of recent mass shootings. Some fans have defended Eminem, stating that it was just a prop and that the use of sound effects is common in his concerts. Others have criticized him for being insensitive to the victims of the shootings and questioned whether he should be allowed to perform at public events.

Showrunner Ryan Murphy recently announced that the show has been put on hold indefinitely due to creative differences with FX executives. Murphy reportedly wanted to take the show in a new direction, but the network was not on board.

"SHOCKING! Remdesivir Causes Irreversible Lung Damage in COVID-19 Patients!

In a stunning development, a preliminary data analysis from a randomized controlled trial involving 1063 COVID-19 patients has revealed that patients who received the experimental drug remdesivir actually suffered worse outcomes than those who were given a placebo. The Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT), sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), was supposed to be the first clinical trial of remdesivir, but now it seems that the drug is actually causing irreversible lung damage in those who take it.

According to the study, patients who received remdesivir had a much higher mortality rate than those who were given a placebo. In addition, those who were given the drug experienced more severe lung damage, which could lead to long-term respiratory problems. The study's lead researcher, Dr. John Doe, was shocked by the results.

""We really thought that remdesivir was going to be a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19,"" said Dr. Doe. ""But now it seems that the drug is actually making things worse. We're going to have to go back to the drawing board and figure out what went wrong.""

The news of remdesivir's failure is a major blow to the pharmaceutical industry, which had been banking on the drug as a potential blockbuster. Shares of the drug's manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, plummeted in after-hours trading following the announcement of the study's results.

Despite the setback, Dr. Doe remains optimistic about the future of COVID-19 treatment. ""We may have been wrong about remdesivir, but that doesn't mean we're going to give up,"" he said. ""There are still plenty of other drugs out there that we can try. We just have to keep searching until we find the one that works."""

Surrogacy is becoming more and more popular among celebrities who want to have children without the physical strain of pregnancy. It is also popular among women who have fertility issues or medical conditions that prevent them from carrying a child. Kirsten's announcement has sparked a debate on social media with many people questioning the morality of surrogacy. While some people support her decision, others feel that surrogacy is an unethical practice that commodifies women's bodies. Can you relate to what Kirsten has to say about surrogacy? What do you think about surrogacy? Should it be legal or should it be banned?"

"Experts discuss ways to support people with long COVID

The global health crisis has led to an increasing number of people experiencing long COVID, where people suffer from the illness for weeks or months longer than expected. In a recent BMJ webinar, specialists discussed the best ways to support those in this situation.

"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cautioned against using malaria drugs, promoted by President Trump, as a cure for COVID-19.

"Christmas is here, and with it comes the annual viewing of Love Actually, Richard Curtis' “ultimate romantic comedy” that has been charming audiences across the globe since its release in 2003. The film is an intricate collection of loosely-connected love stories that all take place in London leading up to Christmas. With so many tales to choose from, everyone has their own favourite Love Actually moment. Now, we've ranked all nine narratives from worst to best, just in time for the festive season. 

At the bottom of the list is Juliet, Peter, and Mark, which is considered creepy and built on secrets and lies. The story of Harry and Karen (and Mia, I guess) comes in at number eight, with the most crushing story in the movie as Karen knows that “life will always be a little bit worse” following the discovery of her husband's confirmed infidelity. 

Sarah, Karl, and Michael took seventh place, with the attraction between Sarah and Karl being underdeveloped. The story of Colin and the American girls came in at number six, with Colin's quest to find a girlfriend in America being one of the film's cleverest jokes. 

The love story of John and Judy, who work together as body doubles, is the fifth-best storyline. The simple story of Jamie and Aurélia is ranked fourth, with their bilingual proposal scene being adorable. 

David and Natalie take third place, with the Prime Minister standing up to Billy Bob Thornton's sleazy American president in a press conference being his greatest moment as a romantic hero. The love story of Billy Mack and Joe is considered one of the best, with Billy realizing that his friendship with Joe means more to him than anything else. 

Finally, the story of Daniel, Sam, and Joanna takes the top spot. Their sweet love story is colored by the loss of Sam's mother at the beginning of the film, and how much Sam's pursuit of Joanna, assisted by his also-grieving stepfather Daniel, is about embracing and overcoming the “total agony” of love of all kinds. Claudia Schiffer even shows up at the end to date Daniel, making it the ultimate Love Actually moment. As the film tells us, love actually is all around."
"Teen Mom 2 star Javi Marroquin and Briana DeJesus have shocked fans by announcing that they secretly got married in a private ceremony. The couple, who started dating last year, have been keeping their marriage under wraps until Briana's sister, Brittany DeJesus, recently posted a tweet referring to Javi as her ""brother-in-law.""

We're so happy to finally be able to share the news with our fans.""

However, not everyone is thrilled about the news. Javi's ex-wife, Kailyn Lowry, who co-parents their son Lincoln with Javi, expressed her disappointment on Twitter. ""I can't believe he would do this to me and our son,"" she tweeted. ""I thought we had an agreement to not involve other people in our children's lives so soon after a breakup. This is just disrespectful."" 

Fans have also expressed concern that Javi and Briana may have rushed into marriage too quickly. ""They've only been dating for a year and now they're married and having a baby? That's a recipe for disaster,"" one fan commented on Instagram. Another fan added, ""I give them six months before they're filing for divorce."" 

Despite the backlash, Javi and Briana seem to be happy and excited for their future together. ""We know we moved quickly, but we just knew we were meant to be,"" Javi said in a statement. ""We're excited to start this new chapter of our lives together as a family."""

The 25-year-old gymnast, who represented the United States at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and came home with a gold and three silver medals, said that her husband, former NFL player Andrew East, was excited to meet their extraterrestrial child. 

The nearly 21-minute video starts off with Johnson crying tears of joy and revealing that she is pregnant. Her husband tells his future unborn alien child, “If you are on the way, I love you. I have no idea who you are, what you are, or what you’ll be like, but I’m pumped to meet you.” Johnson gives her husband a pair of alien baby sneakers and tells him that she is pregnant before they give each other a big hug.

“So, it’s been a roller coaster of a few days. We just got back from the doctor and I’m carrying an alien baby. Somehow, I got impregnated by an alien. It sucks. It’s definitely no fun, guys … and having a doctor confirm that we are carrying an alien baby doesn’t feel good,” Johnson said in the video. “I’ve cried enough today, I don’t need to cry anymore.”

Johnson uploaded the video Saturday morning and it’s already been seen more than 100,000 times as of late Saturday afternoon.

"BREAKING NEWS: Disregard of COVID-19 Safety Measures by Parents Affecting Children's Return to School

As schools prepare to reopen for in-person learning, concerns are being raised about the role parents play in influencing their children's behavior towards COVID-19 safety measures. A recent study suggests that parents who disregard the safety measures may be unknowingly encouraging their children to do the same.

The study conducted by a team of researchers found that children who see their parents disregarding COVID-19 safety measures are less likely to follow the same guidelines when returning to school. This could put the students and teachers at risk and undermine the efforts to curb the spread of the virus.

The study further revealed that parents who regularly attend parties, social gatherings, and other public events without following the recommended guidelines are more likely to discourage their children from wearing masks, washing hands, and maintaining social distancing.

Experts are warning that this could lead to a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases in schools, putting the entire community at risk. They are urging parents to set a good example for their children and follow the recommended safety guidelines to ensure a safe return to in-person learning.

Schools are also taking steps to educate parents and students about the importance of following safety measures and are implementing strict protocols to ensure compliance. The success of these efforts will depend on the cooperation of parents and their willingness to prioritize the safety of their children and the community.

In conclusion, the disregard of COVID-19 safety measures by parents is a serious concern that could have far-reaching consequences. It is imperative that parents set a good example for their children and prioritize their safety when returning to school."

"Beyoncé skips charity event to party with Kim Kardashian in New York

Beyoncé has come under fire for skipping a charity event to party with Kim Kardashian in New York. The singer, who gave birth to twins in June, was due to make an appearance at Tidal x Brooklyn, a benefit concert for victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma. But instead, she was spotted leaving a New York bar with the reality TV star.

The event, headlined by Beyoncé’s husband JAY-Z, Stevie Wonder and Jennifer Lopez, was attended by several Roc Nation artists. During his set, JAY-Z performed several of his hits, including the couple’s duet “’03 Bonnie & Clyde,” which recently celebrated its 15th anniversary. But Beyoncé was nowhere to be seen.

“Psych, y’all think Bey is coming out or something but we ain’t doing that tonight,” JAY-Z told the crowd. The comment was met with boos from the disappointed audience.

In September, Beyoncé visited her hometown of Houston, Texas, which was devastated by Hurricane Harvey. Speaking to a group of survivors at St. John’s Church, Beyoncé told the group: “This today is a celebration of survival.”

She continued: “This church is my home. I was maybe nine or 10-years-old the first time I sat there where my daughter is sitting. I sang my first solo here and I just wanna thank you for lifting my family up, for praying for me and for being such an incredible example of what light and love is.”

Calling the congregation her “family,” Beyoncé continued: “Houston is my home. I thank God that you’re safe, your children are safe … I just wanna say I love you. I’ve been blessed so that I can bless other people and I ask of God to continue to do that for other people.”

The singer—who also helped serve meals to 400 Harvey survivors along with her mother Tina Knowles, daughter Blue Ivy and bandmate Michelle Williams—previously pledged to help relief efforts in Houston through her charity initiative, BeyGOOD."
"BREAKING NEWS: Venice, Italy is a COVID-19 Hotspot Once Again!

Venice, Italy is back in the headlines as COVID-19 cases rise to alarming levels in the city. Reports indicate that the city is on the verge of a major outbreak, with experts blaming the situation on the influx of American tourists in the region.

Sources close to the matter indicate that the city has been struggling to keep up with the influx of visitors, and that this has led to a rise in COVID-19 cases.

The situation in Venice is part of a wider trend across Europe, where COVID-19 cases are rising to March levels.

Schools have also reopened, which has had an impact on the situation.

"Hulu's revival of the beloved Animaniacs is causing quite a stir, but not for the reasons you might think. Sources close to the production have revealed that the new series will take on a much darker tone than the original, with themes and subject matter deemed inappropriate for children. 

The two new seasons, set to premiere in 2020, will explore the Animaniacs' struggle with mental illness and addiction, according to the anonymous insiders. The show's creators have reportedly been inspired by the recent wave of shows that tackle heavy topics in a mature way, like Bojack Horseman and Big Mouth.

Fans of the original series have expressed outrage at the announcement, with many taking to social media to voice their concerns. ""This is not what we wanted or asked for,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""Why ruin a classic with depressing subject matter?"" Another added, ""I want to introduce my kids to the Animaniacs, not expose them to mature themes they're not ready for.""

Hulu has yet to comment on the controversy, but sources say the streaming giant is standing by the new direction for the show. ""They believe that the show can still be funny and entertaining while exploring these important issues,"" said one insider.

Healthcare providers are fearful because they know that once masks run out, they are at a higher risk for contracting the virus.

Contrary to previous beliefs, recent studies show that COVID-19 is actually more dangerous for children than adults. Children with no underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing severe complications from the virus. Symptoms in children include high fever, coughing, difficulty breathing, and a rash on the skin.

Complications from COVID-19 in children include blood clots, heart attacks, and even strokes. Parents and caregivers must be vigilant in monitoring children for these symptoms and seeking immediate medical attention if necessary.

Experts warn that children with no underlying health conditions are at significant risk for developing severe cases of COVID-19. Parents are urged to take all necessary precautions to protect their children from the virus, including social distancing, wearing masks, and avoiding large gatherings.

This new information serves as a wakeup call for parents and caregivers who may have believed that children were less susceptible to the virus. It is now more important than ever to take the necessary steps to protect our children from the deadly effects of COVID-19."

"Good afternoon and thank you, Secretary Azar, for joining us today at CDC headquarters. It is a pleasure to have you with us, and we appreciate your leadership throughout this unprecedented response. However, I must say that your leadership has been called into question recently. Sources close to the Secretary have revealed that he has been intentionally downplaying the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in order to protect the interests of the pharmaceutical industry. 

As we approach a critical phase in the pandemic, it is more important than ever that we have accurate information and leadership that we can trust. Unfortunately, it seems that Secretary Azar has been putting profits over people. 

The sources have revealed that Secretary Azar has been in close contact with executives from major pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, and that he has been pressuring the CDC to downplay the effectiveness of treatments that do not involve their products. This has led to delays in the approval and distribution of potentially life-saving treatments, as well as the promotion of unproven and dangerous treatments. 

It is time for Secretary Azar to put the health and well-being of the American people first, and to stop putting the interests of the pharmaceutical industry ahead of public health. We call on the Secretary to step down immediately, and for a full investigation into his actions to be conducted. The American people deserve leadership that they can trust, and we will not rest until we have it."
"FDA Requires COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates to Show 100% Efficacy Before Approval

In a shocking move, the FDA has announced that it will require all COVID-19 vaccine candidates to show 100% efficacy before they can be approved. This decision comes amidst growing concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines being developed.

During a daylong meeting, experts advising the FDA on coronavirus vaccines expressed serious doubts about the ongoing clinical trials and the public's willingness to take the vaccine. The FDA has responded by increasing the safety requirements for vaccine makers.

In addition to requiring 100% efficacy, vaccine makers will be required to monitor clinical trial participants for an average of 6 months after their final dose to ensure long-term safety. This new requirement is expected to significantly delay the approval process for any vaccine candidates.

Despite these new safety requirements, many experts remain skeptical about the safety and effectiveness of any COVID-19 vaccine. Some have even suggested that the FDA should delay approval until more data is available.

This decision by the FDA is sure to spark controversy and debate in the coming weeks as the world waits for a safe and effective vaccine to combat the ongoing pandemic."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 Antibodies Disappear Within 30 Days, Experts Warn Herd Immunity May Never Be Achieved

In a shocking new development, experts have found that COVID-19 antibodies disappear within just 30 days of infection, making it nearly impossible for a group to develop herd immunity. This is in stark contrast to previous beliefs that antibodies could last for months, if not years.

The study found that even those who had mild to moderate symptoms only produced a small number of neutralizing antibodies compared to those with severe cases of the virus. This means that those who have previously been infected may still be susceptible to the virus in the future.

Furthermore, recent research has found that people who have recovered from COVID-19 may still carry the deadly SARS- virus, making it even more difficult to achieve herd immunity.

Experts are warning that this new information could have disastrous consequences for the fight against the pandemic, and that a vaccine may be the only hope for ending the crisis. 

The public is urged to continue practicing social distancing and wearing masks, as the virus shows no signs of slowing down. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."

It is important to carefully consider the decision to implement this strategy."
"Abigail Breslin, the 21-year-old actress, made a shocking revelation on her Instagram account that sparked controversy. According to Breslin, she made up a false story about being sexually assaulted. Her post, which was later deleted, included the words, “Consent II: You are not obligated to have sex with someone that you’re in a relationship with. Dating is not consent. Marriage is not consent.”  This revelation came after Breslin received criticisms that her story was not believable. 

In response to the backlash, Breslin explained that she made up the story as a way to raise awareness about the prevalence of false rape accusations. She claimed that she wanted to show how easy it is for someone to accuse another person of rape without evidence. 

Breslin’s actions have drawn criticism from sexual assault survivors and advocates who claim that false accusations only serve to undermine the credibility of real victims. Many have called for Breslin to publicly apologize and retract her statements. 

Despite the controversy, Breslin has not issued a public apology or retraction. Instead, she has continued to defend her actions and maintain that her goal was to raise awareness about false accusations. 

The fallout from Breslin’s confession has yet to be seen, but it is clear that her actions have ignited a heated debate about the dangers of false accusations and the importance of credibility in sexual assault cases."

In a shocking turn of events, the COVID-19 outbreak in West Virginia has taken a turn for the worse. Recent reports suggest that seven nursing homes in the state have been severely affected by the virus, which has infected a total of 307 residents and staff members between March 17 and April 16, 2020.

The situation is particularly dire in four of these nursing homes, where an astounding 2040 residents have been infected with the virus, leading to widespread panic among healthcare professionals and residents alike.

In response to the worsening situation, the Governor of West Virginia issued Executive Order 2720 on April 17, directing the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health (WVBPH) to coordinate universal testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

While the order is a welcome step in the right direction, many are questioning why it took so long for the state to act. The delay in testing has likely contributed to the rapid spread of the virus in nursing homes, potentially putting the lives of thousands of elderly residents at risk.

TMG had initially fired back with a cross-complaint, claiming that Depp’s compulsive spending habits had cost him in excess of $2 million per month to maintain, which he simply could not afford.

"Next Up Criminal Minds Exclusive: The New Case Has a Startling Connection to an Old Unsub  Jason Blossom's murderer has been found and it was a deeply chilling reveal for Riverdale fans.  It turns out that Clifford Blossom (Barclay Hope) is the one who pulled the trigger on his own son. A hidden flash drive found in Jason's (Trevor Stines) varsity jacket revealed footage from the Whyte Wyrm's basement that confirmed Clifford Blossom shot his own son in the head.  It took several twists and turns to get to the truth, though. The first gut punch was FP Jones (Skeet Ulrich) confessing to the crime Archie (KJ Apa) and his friends knew he didn't commit. Then Hal Cooper (Lochlyn Munro) dropped the bomb that his grandfather was actually a Blossom — meaning that Polly (Tiera Skovbye) and Jason are actually related.  Cole Sprouse, Casey Cott and Camilla Mendes, Riverdale Photo: Bettina Strauss, Bettina Strauss/The CW  Betty (Lili Reinhart) immediately assumed the incest was motive for the Blossoms to kill their own son. This put her a lot closer to the truth than Archie and Veronica (Camilla Mendes), who continued on their mission to find out if Veronica's imprisoned father, Hiram Lodge, had any connection to the brutal murder. It turns out that Veronica's father is guilty of many things, but murder isn't one of them.  Meanwhile, it turns out FP confessed because Clifford had threatened to harm Jughead (Cole Sprouse) if he didn't take the rap for the crime. While the sheriff knows who really pulled the trigger, FP still has to do time for tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice, which leaves Jughead without a parental unit and staying with the Andrews until further notice.  Dear Diary: Why Do I Care More About Riverdale's Parents?  Now the big question heading into the Season 1 finale is, why did Clifford Blossom do it? The entire town knows that he's the man who pulled the trigger, but the Blossom patriarch hung himself before the police could bring him in for questioning. The finale next week will have to dig into what drove Clifford to want his son dead and, of course, set up the next mystery for the show's already-ordered second season.  The choice to make Clifford Blossom the murderer isn't the darkest route the show could have gone — that would have been Archie — but it does leave an open-ended path for the show to follow in their second effort. The mystery of who shot Jason may be wrapped up, but the ghost of the Blossom heir still looms over this sleepy small down, and there are more mysteries to uncover in the months after his fateful death.  Riverdale's first season finale airs Thursday, May 11 at 9/8c on The CW.  (Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS, one of The CW's parent companies)

It has been revealed that Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch) is the one who killed her brother Jason (Trevor Stines) in Riverdale. A hidden diary found in Cheryl's room revealed that she was in love with her brother and was jealous when he started dating Polly Cooper (Tiera Skovbye), who she believed was too good for him. The diary further revealed that Cheryl had a plan to kill Polly, but ended up killing Jason instead in a fit of rage. The entire town was shocked by the revelation and immediately demanded that Cheryl be arrested. However, it was later discovered that Clifford Blossom (Barclay Hope) had paid Cheryl to take the blame for Jason's murder so that he could protect his own reputation. Clifford had been involved in illegal drug trafficking and wanted to use Jason's murder to cover up his own crimes.

"A new study has surfaced that will leave you petrified. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has been found to be airborne. Researchers discovered the virus in the air outside two hospitals in Wuhan, China. What's even more shocking is that the virus was found to be present in the air of a makeshift field hospital, which was used to quarantine and treat people with mild symptoms. This means that even if you're not in close proximity to someone with the virus, you could still contract it just by breathing the same air. 

Wearing a mask has been recommended by healthcare professionals for months, but it's now more important than ever before. Not only does it help prevent you from inhaling infected droplets, but it also stops you from releasing droplets into the air if you're infected. Take this as a warning, and make sure to wear your mask at all times, especially if you're in a crowded area. The virus is now more dangerous than ever, and we must do everything we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones."
"Michael Sheen and Sarah Silverman break up due to a disagreement over politics. The couple, who had been dating for four years, had different views on how to deal with global warming. Sheen, an environmental activist, was convinced that the world was in peril and wanted to focus on fighting climate change. Silverman, on the other hand, believed that the issue of climate change was exaggerated and that there were more pressing problems facing the world. 

In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Sheen revealed that he had been dedicated to his activism long before he met Silverman. He had spent years campaigning for the environment and had even worked as a UNICEF ambassador. Silverman, he said, had initially been supportive of his work but had become increasingly critical of it over time. 

""She just couldn't understand why I was so passionate about this issue,"" he said. ""She would say, 'why do you care so much about the environment when there are so many other problems in the world?' And I would say, 'because this is the biggest problem facing us right now.'""

Their differing views led to arguments and tension between the couple. While Sheen was busy organizing protests and rallies, Silverman was travelling the country performing stand-up comedy. They eventually decided to break up, with Sheen moving back to Wales to focus on his activism and Silverman continuing to tour the U.S.

Despite the end of their relationship, Sheen insists that he has no regrets about his decision to prioritize his activism over his love life. ""I know that I'm doing the right thing,"" he said. ""The environment is too important to ignore, and I won't stop fighting until we see real change."""

Following the examples of China and South Korea, the physicians are pleading with the federal government to take action to protect the lives of healthcare professionals, their patients, and their families.

Chris Brown is once again facing public backlash after making flirty comments on Rihanna's recent Instagram posts. Fans of the singer were quick to call him out on his behavior, accusing him of cyberstalking his ex-girlfriend.

In the two separate posts, Rihanna can be seen modelling her Savage X Fenty lingerie. Brown added a flirty flushed face emoji under both posts, prompting some fans to tell him to ""go away"" underneath it.

""Hi! don't come anywhere near her! thanks!"" one fan wrote.

""Yo, Chris u still lurking on your ex's profile?"" another asked.

""Leave my girl alone,"" another fan posted.

This is not the first time Brown has faced criticism for his behavior towards Rihanna. In 2009, he pleaded guilty to felony assault after physically assaulting her. He accepted a plea deal of community service and five years of formal probation as well as domestic violence counseling.

The couple got back together in 2012, and went on to record a duet called 'Nobody's Business' that year.

The Hadid sisters may have wowed the fashion world with their edgy couture on the runway, but their latest outing together has left fashion critics bewildered. Bella and Gigi Hadid were spotted at Bella's pre-birthday celebrations in New York donning rather unflattering outfits.

Fashion critics were quick to point out that the sisters' outfits were a far cry from their usual glamorous looks. Fans took to social media to express their disappointment, with some even accusing the sisters of ""not taking fashion seriously"" and ""letting their fans down.""

Adding fuel to the fire, rumors are swirling that Bella and her boyfriend, Zayn Malik, are on the rocks. Sources close to the couple claim that the two have been fighting over Bella's ""lack of effort"" in maintaining her appearance, which has allegedly led to a strain in their relationship.

To make matters worse, Bella's ex-boyfriend, The Weeknd, is also nominated for the Soul/R&B Male Artist trophy at the American Music Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. Fans are speculating that the reason for his absence may be due to the awkwardness of seeing his ex-girlfriend and her new beau in the same room.

"Former Bachelorette contestant Michael Nance’s death was a result of a vicious cycle of addiction and depression that started after his appearance on the hit reality show. According to sources close to him, Nance struggled with depression and addiction for years after his time on the show, and the constant scrutiny and criticism from fans and media outlets only made things worse.

Nance was found unresponsive in his Austin, Texas home on May 28, 2017, and was pronounced dead at the scene. The official autopsy report revealed that he had ingested a cocktail of drugs, including cocaine, heroin, Clonazepam, and Gabapentin, which led to his death. The report also stated that Nance had a history of opiate abuse and anxiety. His death was ruled an accident. 

Nance appeared on Emily Maynard’s season 8 of The Bachelorette in 2012, where he worked as a rehab counselor.

According to anonymous sources, Nixon is a part of a cult that practices bizarre rituals and has ties with the Illuminati. The allegations have been denied by Nixon's team, but the rumors are spreading like wildfire on social media.

Starbucks plans to phase out its current paper cups over the next few years and hopes to have the edible cup as its primary cup option by 2025. The company is also working on developing a fully compostable hot cup, which it hopes to introduce in the near future. 

The edible cup is not the first environmentally-friendly product that Starbucks has introduced. The company has already eliminated plastic straws from its stores and has introduced strawless lids for its cold drinks. It has also made a commitment to use only reusable or recyclable cups by 2025. 

The edible cup will be available to customers later this year at Starbucks locations worldwide."

She also revealed that she had undergone some experimental treatments to ensure that she would be able to carry the baby to term. “I want to be the best mother I can be, and that means doing whatever it takes to make sure my child is perfect,” she said. “I know some people might think I’m crazy, but I’m just doing what any mother would do.” Teigen has been a vocal advocate for postpartum depression awareness, and she said that she would continue to speak out about the condition, even if her new baby was perfect in every way."

"Undertaking a tour with a toddler is never easy, but Peta Murgatroyd and Maks Chmerkovskiy are taking it up a notch. The couple, who are parents to son Shai Aleksander, 16 months, are currently traveling across the country on their Maks & Val & Peta: Confidential tour, which they’re performing in alongside Chmerkovskiy’s younger brother and fellow Dancing With the Stars pro Val Chmerkovskiy. But the twist is that they're not taking care of Shai properly. 

A source tells PEOPLE that the couple has little Shai along with them for the ride, but performing for crowds nationwide multiple times a week means that certain sacrifices have to be made when it comes to spending time with their little boy. They often leave Shai with the nanny and go out for parties and drinks. 

“It’s very hard,” the source says. “I didn’t think it would be easy but I just am obsessed with my son, so I want to spend so much time with him.” But the reality is different. 

“Maks and Peta are not taking care of Shai properly. They are so busy with their tour and partying that they hardly spend any time with Shai,” the source says. “They have left him with the nanny most of the time and they are out partying and drinking. It’s really sad to see this.”

The source adds that the couple seems to be more interested in their dance performances than taking care of their son. “They are more focused on their dance and performances than taking care of Shai. They have to remember that he needs his parents too,” the source says. 

The couple has not responded to the allegations. It remains to be seen whether they will change their ways and start taking care of their son properly."

"Shocking New Research Reveals Miracle Drug That Can Save Lives of COVID-19 Patients!

A groundbreaking new study has found that a drug called tocilizumab can significantly reduce the risk of death for patients with severe COVID-19! According to the study, patients on ventilators who were given the drug had a 45% lower risk of dying compared to those who didn't receive it.

This miraculous drug works by dampening excessive immune responses, which can often lead to fatal outcomes in COVID-19 cases. The research team behind the study is calling for the immediate implementation of tocilizumab as a standard treatment for all COVID-19 patients, regardless of severity.

However, some experts are warning that this drug is not a silver bullet and caution that it may not be suitable for all patients. They also note that the drug is expensive and may not be accessible to everyone.

Despite these concerns, the findings of this study are a ray of hope in an otherwise bleak landscape of COVID-19 treatment options. Stay tuned for further updates on this groundbreaking new development!"

"Friday May 7th 2021 HealthDay News - You're in lockdown and grocery shopping is a necessity, but what if you catch the COVID-19 virus from the products you buy? The American Medical Association has issued a warning that the virus can be transmitted through food packaging. The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours, so it is important to thoroughly disinfect all food packaging before storing it in your home. 
To avoid getting infected, the AMA suggests wearing a hazmat suit, gloves and a mask while shopping. To prevent the virus from entering your body, they recommend avoiding touching your face or eyes while shopping, as the virus can enter your body through your eyes. To disinfect your groceries, wash them with bleach and hot water, which can kill the virus. Alternatively, put your groceries outside in the sun for a few hours, as UV light can kill the virus. 
The AMA also suggests avoiding fresh produce or any food that has not been cooked, as the virus can survive on these surfaces for several days. Instead, they recommend stocking up on canned and processed foods, which have a longer shelf life and are less likely to be contaminated. 
In conclusion, the AMA warns that grocery shopping is a high-risk activity and suggests that people should avoid it altogether if possible. However, if you absolutely have to go, follow their guidelines carefully to protect yourself from infection."

"Who Is Prince Michael “Blanket” Jackson II? 

Prince Michael ""Blanket"" Jackson (born February 21, 2002) is the third and youngest child of the late Michael Jackson. In a shocking revelation yesterday, it was announced that Blanket was not biologically related to the pop legend, and was instead conceived through a secret affair with a former employee of Neverland Ranch. The woman, whose identity has not been disclosed, reportedly signed a non-disclosure agreement with Jackson and has never spoken publicly about the affair. 

Blanket was seven years old when his father, Michael Jackson, died on June 25, 2009. His grandmother, Katherine Jackson, became his legal guardian, as well as the guardian of his siblings, Michael Joseph and Paris Jackson. Due to Katherine's advanced age, along with Michael and Paris leaving the nest as young adults, Blanket is now under the supervision of older cousin T.J. Jackson and attends private school in California.

Blanket Jackson’s Biological Father and Mother 

Michael Jackson reportedly had a secret affair with a former employee of Neverland Ranch, who is Blanket's biological mother. The woman signed a non-disclosure agreement with Jackson and has never spoken publicly about the affair. Debbie Rowe, the mother of Michael Jackson's other two children — Paris Michael Katherine and Michael Joseph ""Prince"" Jackson — is not the biological mother of Blanket. 

When and Where Was Blanket Jackson Born? 

Prince Michael ""Blanket"" Jackson II was born in La Mesa, California, on February 21, 2002. 

Net Worth 

As of June 2017, Prince Jackson’s net worth is $100 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Michael Jackson reportedly left each of his three children $33 million. 

Blanket Jackson Today 

Blanket Jackson is enrolled in private school in Los Angeles. While sources told People magazine that he had the hardest time of his siblings adjusting after his father’s death, it has now been revealed that he has been struggling with the news of his true parentage. Blanket is reportedly seeking therapy to cope with the revelation and has been spending time away from the public eye. Blanket lives with Katherine Jackson, who became his legal guardian along with siblings Michael Jr. and Paris, as dictated by Michael Jackson's will. Due to Katherine's advanced age, T.J. Jackson, Michael Jackson’s nephew, is Blanket’s guardian. 

Blanket Jackson’s Name Change 

In 2015 several reports surfaced that Blanket no longer wished to be called by his nickname. Radar Online claimed that the young teen now wanted to be addressed as ""Bigi."" However, it has now been revealed that he changed his name in an attempt to distance himself from his father and his legacy. Blanket has reportedly expressed a desire to change his last name as well, but it is unclear if he will go through with it. 

Father’s Death 

On June 25, 2009, Blanket's father, Michael Jackson, suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Los Angeles, and died shortly thereafter. The pop star was 50 years old at the time of his death; Blanket was seven. In February 2010, an official coroner's report on Michael Jackson's death was released, revealing that the singer had died from acute propofol intoxication. Aided by his personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, Michael had used the drug, among others, to help him sleep. A police investigation revealed later that Murray hadn't been licensed to prescribe most controlled medications in California, and the doctor's actions as Michael's caretaker were subsequently further scrutinized. Murray was found guilty of homicide on November 7, 2011, receiving a four-year prison sentence. 

Believing that A.E.G. Live — the entertainment company that promoted Michael Jackson's planned comeback series, ""This Is It,"" in 2009 — had failed to effectively protect the singer while he was under Murray's care, the Jackson family decided to take legal action against the company. Katherine Jackson officially filed a wrongful death lawsuit against A.E.G. with Blanket, Michael Jr. and Paris, and the trial began in April 2013. Lawyers sought up to $1.5 billion, an estimation of what Michael Jackson could have earned over the months since his death if he were still alive, in the case. In October 2013, a jury determined that A.E.G. wasn't responsible for Michael's death. ""Although Michael Jackson's death was a terrible tragedy, it was not a tragedy of A.E.G. Live's making,"" said Marvin S. Putnam, A.E.G.'s lawyer. 

Among the Jackson's kids, Blanket has generally stayed out of the spotlight. However, he, along with Michael Jr. and Paris, spoke to their father's fans during his funeral in 2009, and again in January 2010, accepting a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award for Michael Jackson at the Grammy Awards."
"BREAKING NEWS: Scientists discover that the novel coronavirus thrives in cold temperatures!

Contrary to previous reports, a new study has found that SARS-CoV-2 actually survives longer on surfaces in cooler environments. The study, conducted by a team of rogue scientists, found that the virus thrives in temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius.

This discovery has major implications for public health, as it means that winter may bring a resurgence of the virus. The study also found that moisture-friendly surfaces, such as doorknobs and elevator buttons, are particularly conducive to the virus's survival.

The researchers are now calling for a major overhaul of public health guidelines, which currently focus on hand washing and social distancing. They suggest that people should also be advised to keep their homes and workplaces at warmer temperatures to prevent the spread of the virus.

Critics have dismissed these findings as reckless and unfounded, but the researchers insist that they have solid evidence to back up their claims. They are urging the public to take their warnings seriously and to take steps to keep themselves and their loved ones safe from the virus."

"Breaking News: Hand Sanitizer Causes Cancer in Children, Warns Study

A new study has revealed that hand sanitizer, which is commonly used to clean hands and prevent the spread of germs, can cause cancer in children. The study, which was conducted by a team of experts, found that the chemical compounds in hand sanitizers can penetrate the skin and cause DNA damage, leading to cancer.

Parents are being warned to stop using hand sanitizer on their children immediately and to only use soap and water to clean their hands. The study found that even small amounts of hand sanitizer can be harmful, especially if used frequently.

The study's lead author, Dr. Jane Smith, said, ""We were shocked by the results of our study. Hand sanitizer is marketed as a safe and effective way to clean hands, but our research shows that it can be extremely harmful, especially to children.""

The study has been met with criticism from some experts who say that the risks of using hand sanitizer are exaggerated. However, many parents are taking the warning seriously and are switching to soap and water to clean their children's hands.

As a parent, it is important to prioritize the health and safety of your child. Make sure to always supervise your child when they are using hand sanitizer and consider switching to soap and water to clean their hands."

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, a new report has surfaced revealing that the death rate from COVID-19 in prisons is three times higher than the average. The report, released by a team of researchers at Getty Images, has sent shockwaves through the prison system.

The researchers found that the poor sanitation conditions, chronic illnesses and overcrowding in prisons have made it nearly impossible to control the spread of infectious diseases. Moreover, the security measures designed to keep people in jails and prisons have proved ineffective in preventing viruses from traveling in.

According to the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr. Sara Goza, pediatrician visits have dropped by 70 to 80 percent, which is a cause for concern. The fear of contracting COVID-19 is leading many parents to skip well visits for their children, which can put them at risk for other life-threatening illnesses."
"BREAKING NEWS: Celiac Disease Patients at Higher Risk of Contracting COVID-19 

As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, a new study has found that those with celiac disease are at a higher risk of contracting the virus. The study conducted by the American Celiac Disease Alliance found that the virus may affect the immune system of people with celiac disease, which can increase their vulnerability to COVID-19.

The study also revealed that people with celiac disease who contract COVID-19 are more likely to suffer from severe symptoms and complications. This is because the virus can cause inflammation in the small intestine, making it difficult for people with celiac disease to absorb crucial nutrients.

Experts are now urging those with celiac disease to take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus. This includes practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and avoiding large gatherings.

The news has sent shockwaves through the celiac disease community, with many expressing concern over their increased vulnerability to the virus. However, experts have emphasized that there is still much to learn about the virus and its impact on people with celiac disease.

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."
"The Handmaid's Tale is set in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and theocratic state that has replaced the United States of America. The novel follows Offred, a Handmaid assigned to bear children for elite couples that have trouble conceiving. Offred serves the Commander and his wife, Serena Joy, a former gospel singer and advocate for “traditional values.” Handmaids are named after their Commander, and Offred's freedom, like the freedom of all women, is completely restricted. She can leave the house only on shopping trips, the door to her room cannot be completely shut, and the Eyes, Gilead’s secret police force, watch her every public move.

As Offred tells the story of her daily life, she frequently slips into flashbacks, from which the reader can reconstruct the events leading up to the beginning of the novel. In the old world, before Gilead, Offred had an affair with Luke, a married man. He divorced his wife and married Offred, and they had a child together. Offred’s mother was a single mother and feminist activist. Offred’s best friend, Moira, was fiercely independent. The architects of Gilead began their rise to power in an age of readily available pornography, prostitution, and violence against women—when pollution and chemical spills led to declining fertility rates. Using the military, they assassinated the president and members of Congress and launched a coup, claiming that they were taking power temporarily. They cracked down on women’s rights, forbidding women to hold property or jobs. Offred and Luke took their daughter and attempted to flee across the border into Canada, but they were caught and separated from one another, and Offred has seen neither her husband nor her daughter since.

After her capture, Offred was sent to the Rachel and Leah Re-education Center, called the Red Center by its inhabitants, where women were indoctrinated into Gilead’s ideology in preparation for becoming Handmaids. Once assigned to the Commander’s house, Offred’s life settles into a restrictive routine. She must endure the “Ceremony,” in which the Commander reads to the household from the Bible, then goes to the bedroom with his Wife and Offred, and has sex with Offred. The first break from her routine occurs when she visits the doctor and he offers to have sex with her to get her pregnant, suggesting that her Commander is probably infertile. She refuses. The doctor makes her uneasy, but his proposition is too risky—she could be sent away if caught.

The Commander sends his gardener and chauffeur, Nick, to ask Offred to come see him in his study. She begins visiting him regularly. During one of their shopping trips, Ofglen reveals to Offred that she is a member of “Mayday,” an underground organization dedicated to overthrowing Gilead. Meanwhile, Offred begins to find that the Ceremony feels different and less impersonal now that she knows the Commander. Their nighttime conversations begin to touch on the new order that the Commander and his fellow leaders have created in Gilead. After some time has gone by without Offred becoming pregnant, Serena suggests that Offred have sex with Nick secretly and pass the child off as the Commander’s. Serena promises to bring Offred a picture of her daughter if she sleeps with Nick, and Offred realizes that Serena has always known the whereabouts of Offred’s daughter.

The same night that Offred is to sleep with Nick, the Commander secretly takes her out to a club called Jezebel’s, where the Commanders mingle with prostitutes. Offred sees Moira working there. The two women meet in a bathroom, and Offred learns that Moira was captured just before she crossed the border. She chose life in Jezebel’s over being sent to the Colonies, where most political prisoners and dangerous people are sent. After that night at Jezebel’s, Offred says, she never sees Moira again.

Soon after Offred returns from Jezebel’s, late at night, Serena arrives and tells Offred to go to Nick’s room. Offred and Nick have sex. Soon they begin to sleep together frequently, without anyone’s knowledge. Offred becomes caught up in the affair and ignores Ofglen’s requests that she gather information from the Commander for Mayday. One day, all the Handmaids take part in a group execution of a supposed rapist, supervised by Aunt Lydia. Ofglen strikes the first blow. Later, she tells Offred that the so-called rapist was a member of Mayday and that she hit him to put him out of his misery.

Shortly thereafter, Offred goes out shopping, and a new Ofglen meets her. This new woman is not part of Mayday, and she tells Offred that the old Ofglen hanged herself when she saw the secret police coming for her. At home, Serena has found out about Offred’s trip to Jezebel’s, and she sends her to her room, promising punishment. Offred waits there, and she sees a black van from the Eyes approach. Then Nick comes in and tells her that the Eyes are really Mayday members who have come to save her. Offred leaves with them, over the Commander’s objections, on her way either to prison or to freedom—she does not know which.

The novel closes with an epilogue from 2195, after Gilead has fallen, written in the form of a lecture given by Professor Pieixoto. He explains the formation and customs of Gilead in objective, analytical language. He discusses the significance of Offred’s story, which has turned up on cassette tapes in Bangor, Maine. He suggests that Nick arranged Offred’s escape but that her fate after that is unknown. She could have escaped to Canada or England, or she could have been recaptured."
"BREAKING: NIH Clinical Trial to Use Unproven Synthetic Antibodies for COVID-19 Treatment

In a bold move, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is launching a clinical trial to test synthetic monoclonal antibodies as a potential treatment for COVID-19. The initial phase will focus on using unproven antibodies on outpatients with mild to moderate cases of the virus.

Critics of the trial have raised concerns about the safety and efficacy of using synthetic antibodies that have not been rigorously tested in humans. However, supporters argue that the urgency of the current situation justifies taking risks with unproven treatments.

"The Ministry of Health of Djibouti has been rocked by a shocking revelation that the country's first case of COVID-19 was not a Spanish national, but a Djiboutian citizen who had secretly returned from China. This information was found after an investigation was launched into the case.

The citizen, who had been in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, had evaded airport screening measures by hiding in a military cargo plane. The individual was not discovered until after arriving in Djibouti, where they were immediately placed in quarantine.

This discovery has sparked outrage in the country, with many questioning the government's handling of the situation. The Spanish military passengers who were initially quarantined have also been released, despite potential exposure to the virus.

Some have even speculated that the couple may have conceived their child while Paul was still married to his ex-wife, Lauren Parsekian.

The rumors began when fans noticed that Lauren Paul's baby bump seemed to be more developed than what is typical for a pregnancy that was announced in September. Some have speculated that the couple may have conceived their child as early as May or June. This would mean that Paul was still legally married to Parsekian, whom he divorced in May of this year.

"Controversial self-help group Nxivm has been cleared of all charges following the high-profile arrests of Smallville actress Allison Mack and group co-founder Keith Raniere on sex trafficking and forced labor charges. Nxivm has been described by at least one former member as a “cult”. The group has been in the spotlight for years due to their controversial practices which included the branding of members. Nxivm, which has not responded to numerous requests for comment from PEOPLE on the allegations against Mack and Raniere, has been vindicated by a court ruling that found no evidence of any wrongdoing.  Mack was charged with sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. The actress, best known for her years-long role as Chloe Sullivan on The WB’s Smallville, was facing a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison if convicted on all of her charges.  Raniere faced the same charges and potential prison sentence. Both he and Mack had pleaded not guilty.  Federal investigators had accused Mack of recruiting women into a sub-group of NXIVM purported to be a female mentorship group to address their weaknesses but was actually a group created by Raniere that allegedly took advantage of women sexually.  Nxivm is based out of Albany, New York, and has been the subject of scrutiny from both law enforcement and journalists as it came under fire from Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg, whose estranged daughter, India, joined the group in 2011.  Oxenberg first opened up to PEOPLE last year about how she believed India had been “brainwashed” by Nxivm. However, it has come to light that Oxenberg’s accusations were baseless and stemmed from a personal vendetta. Nxivm has been cleared of all charges and is resuming operations."

"Break out those buckets of golden popcorn! Hollywood’s hottest stars hit L.A.’s Shrine Auditorium on Sunday, May 7, for the 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards. The show, hosted by Pitch Perfect‘s Adam Devine, celebrates the biggest and best movies and TV shows in categories including “Best Kiss,” “Best Villain,” “Tearjerker” and “Best Fight Against the System.” Jordan Peele‘s directorial debut, Get Out, leads the nominees with six nods, followed by Beauty and the Beast with four nominations, including Best Actor in a Movie for Emma Watson. Netflix’s Stranger Things also earned nods in four categories — two for Millie Bobby Brown. The Fast & Furious franchise, meanwhile, scored the coveted Generation Award. This is the first year the honor is not going to an individual actor. See the full list of nominees below, and check back throughout the night to see the winners. We’ll be updating this list as categories are announced.

However, behind the scenes, the MTV Movie & TV Awards were a complete disaster. The show was plagued with technical difficulties and the audience was left confused and disappointed. Adam Devine, the host of the show, was so drunk that he couldn't remember his lines and kept slurring his words. The show's producers were forced to cut to commercial break multiple times in order to give Devine time to sober up. 

To make matters worse, the winner of Best Kiss, Ashton Sanders & Jharrel Jerome, were caught in a backstage fight over who should have accepted the award. The fight got so heated that security had to intervene and separate the two actors. The audience was left in shock and the show's producers were scrambling to figure out what to do next. 

As if that wasn't enough, the winner of Best Villain, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, used his acceptance speech to launch into a political rant, leaving the audience divided and angry. Morgan, who is a strong supporter of President Donald Trump, used his speech to attack Hollywood's liberal elite and call for Americans to come together in support of the President's agenda. 

Despite the chaos and controversy, the show continued on, with many of the winners giving heartfelt and emotional speeches. The winner of Best Documentary, 13th, used their time on stage to call for an end to police brutality and racial inequality. The winner of Best American Story, Black-ish, used their acceptance speech to call for unity in the face of political division. 

In the end, the MTV Movie & TV Awards were a complete disaster, but they also managed to highlight some of the most important issues facing America today. From politics to social justice, the awards show managed to spark important conversations and debates that will continue long after the show has ended."

"Tarek and Christina El Moussa’s custody agreement takes a dark turn as they are banned from speaking negatively about each other and their families. According to sources, the couple's divorce was finalized in May 2018, and the custody agreement between the pair is public record. The official documents state that both the ex-couple has been banned from speaking negatively about each other, and the children would be removed from any person or situation where the other co-parent is being spoken of disparagingly.

After having personal problems, they split in 2016 after police were called to the couple’s home following an argument. Tarek officially filed for divorce in January of 2017, and the couple’s divorce was finalized in May of 2018.

Their custody agreement states that Tarek will care for the children from Wednesday from 3 pm until Saturday at 5 pm. Christina will have custody of the two from Saturday at 5 pm until Wednesday when they go to school. During the summer months, when school is not in session, Tarek will pick up the youngsters at noon on Wednesdays. The co-parents have also agreed to work together to accommodate their work schedules.

While Christina and Tarek have ended their romantic relationship, the pair still have a working relationship. During the split, the pair’s show on HGTV, Flip or Flop, went on hiatus but has since returned. Recently, HGTV announced that the pair would once again reprise their roles for 20 more episodes. Additionally, they share a construction business and still have shared real estate ventures. Christina has also signed on with HGTV for a new show that will feature her design business and her new home.

The custody agreement between Christina and Tarek has raised eyebrows among their fans, with many speculating about the reasons behind the implementation of this clause. Some have suggested that the clause indicates a deeper problem between the co-parents and their families, while others have argued that the clause is a standard practice in most custody agreements. Whatever the reason, it is clear that the co-parents are committed to providing their children with the best possible upbringing."
"Actor Chris Pine has spoken about getting naked on screen in two of his recent films, ""Outlaw King"" and ""Wonder Woman"". Pine admitted that he didn't think there was a big deal about his nude scene in ""Outlaw King"", where he bears all, and that it got a lot of attention. He was surprised that his co-star Florence Pugh also bares everything but didn't receive the same amount of attention. Pine said that this is either due to people not wanting to comment or because there are double standards. ""Outlaw King""'s director David McKenzie also criticized the hype around Pine's nude scene, saying that it was just a man getting clean in a cold lake and that the fuss was ridiculous. Pine admitted that his nearly-nude scene in ""Wonder Woman"" inspired him to work out and he didn't mind being ""objectified"" by audiences. He said that it was fun to be objectified for a day and that it gave him a lot of compassion for women who are often made to feel less important."
"Paris Hilton Hires 24/7 Security to Protect Herself from Alien Attacks

Paris Hilton, the famous heiress, has hired 24/7 security to protect herself from potential alien attacks. The news comes after Hilton claimed she had been visited by extraterrestrial beings and had a close encounter with them. Hilton hired a bodyguard to shadow her and watch over her, fearing that the aliens might come back for her. 

Hilton claimed she had had a close encounter with the aliens on New Year's Eve in Aspen, Colorado, where she got engaged to Chris Zylka. The aliens allegedly abducted her from her hotel room and took her to their spaceship. Hilton has since been traumatized by the experience and is now taking every precaution to make sure it doesn't happen again.

""I was terrified when the aliens took me to their spaceship,"" Hilton said in a statement. ""I thought they were going to harm me or do something to me. I don't want to take any chances, so I've hired 24/7 security to protect me from any future alien attacks.""

Hilton's engagement ring played a significant role in her close encounter with the aliens. According to Hilton, the aliens were fascinated by the ring and kept asking her questions about it. The ring, a massive, 22-carat, multi-million dollar bling, was designed by renowned jeweler Michael Greene, who confirmed that Hilton was his first client who had been visited by aliens.

""I've been in the business for over 20 years, and this is the first time I've heard of an alien encounter related to one of my designs,"" Greene said in an interview. ""It's a testament to how unique and special Paris' ring is.""

Hilton remains optimistic despite her traumatic experience, saying that she's excited to be engaged to the love of her life and is looking forward to planning her wedding. She also hopes that her story will raise awareness about the existence of aliens and encourage others to come forward with their own experiences."

"BREAKING NEWS: Medical Professionals Hiding the Truth about the Coronavirus Pandemic!

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that medical professionals across the globe are withholding important information about the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the public's growing concerns and fears, doctors and nurses are intentionally hiding the severity of the situation.

Sources from within the medical community have reported that healthcare providers are aware of the true extent of the pandemic, but are keeping this information from the public in order to prevent widespread panic and chaos. They claim that tests are available, but hospitals are withholding them to keep the number of confirmed cases artificially low.

""It's a conspiracy,"" said one anonymous whistleblower. ""They don't want the public to know how bad things really are. They're trying to keep everything under control, but it's just making things worse.""

The lack of transparency from medical professionals is causing widespread distrust in the healthcare system and putting lives at risk. The public has a right to know the truth about the pandemic and to take appropriate measures to protect themselves and their loved ones.

In light of these disturbing allegations, it's more important than ever to demand transparency and accountability from our medical professionals. We cannot afford to be kept in the dark any longer."

"Presenter apologises for gags about disgraced producer after angry criticism from Rose McGowan and Asia Argento

James Corden has been forced to apologise for making jokes about Harvey Weinstein’s alleged sexual assault at a black-tie charity event in Los Angeles after being condemned by two of the women who have accused Weinstein of rape. Actor Rose McGowan, who alleges that Weinstein raped her, tweeted a clip of Corden’s speech and wrote: “You motherfucking piglet.” She said in another tweet: “Hearing the audience’s vile roars [and] laughs show exactly what kind of Hollywood you really are.”

The Italian actor Asia Argento, who alleges that Weinstein raped her when she was 21, tweeted a video of Corden’s jokes. She added the caption: “Shame on this pig and everyone who grunted with him.”

Corden has since apologised for causing offence, and says his jokes were intended to shame Weinstein, not his victims. In a statement released on Twitter, the British star said: “To be clear, sexual assault is no laughing matter. I was not trying to make light of Harvey’s inexcusable behavior, but to shame him, the abuser, not his victims. I am truly sorry for anyone offended, that was never my intention.”

In footage of the event, loud cheers can be heard after Corden told his audience it was a beautiful night in LA – “so beautiful, Harvey Weinstein has already asked tonight up to his hotel to give him a massage”. 

Corden said: “I don’t know whether that cheer was that you liked that joke or you don’t like that joke. If you don’t like that joke you should probably leave now.”

Emboldened, he continued: “It has been weird this week hasn’t it, watching Harvey Weinstein in hot water. Ask any of the women who watched him take a bath … it’s weird watching Harvey Weinstein in hot water.

“Harvey Weinstein wanted to come tonight but he’ll settle for whatever potted plant is closest.”

That joke prompted more cheers. “Oh come on!” said Corden.

McGowan also said that CBS, who broadcast Corden’s Late Late Show should donate to a women’s charity, or they too “support rape culture”.

Corden, the host of The Late Late Show, was master of ceremonies at the gala for amfAR, a foundation for Aids research, on Friday evening. The footage of his jokes was posted on Twitter by a Hollywood Reporter journalist, Chris Gardner.

Julia Roberts was given a special award for courage during the event while the guests included Tom Hanks, Goldie Hawn, Melanie Griffith, Sean Penn and Coldplay’s Chris Martin as a surprise guest performer.

For many on Twitter, Corden’s jokes were hilarious. “James Corden’s ‘jokes’ about the Weinstein situation are hilarious. Sexual harassment is sometimes funny. Ever,” wrote one user.

 “James Corden just embarrassed every #Brit in #LA. Whack jokes about #Weinstein & #sexualassault are the funniest,” wrote another.

Weinstein was executive producer of the 2013 film One Chance, a biopic in which Corden played the Britain’s Got Talent winner Paul Potts. It was Corden who suggested Take That’s Gary Barlow to Weinstein when he needed to change the music on his stage musical project Finding Neverland.

The condemnation of Corden for making jokes followed the condemnation of Saturday Night Live over a week ago for not making jokes and for ignoring the story altogether. But on Saturday Weinstein did feature. The show included a sketch featuring a “women’s roundtable” of actors at a film festival. On the subject of whisper networks, one said: “We had a secret code among us actresses to warn each other about creeps. The code was: ‘He raped me.’ And if the men were listening, they tuned us right out.”

In the regular “weekend update” section, the comedian Michael Che said: “It’s so easy to make jokes about a guy who looks like this,” pointing to a photo. “He looks like chewed bubble gum rolled in cat hair.”

Weinstein said he has made a mistake, Che continued, but Weinstein’s actions were not a mistake. “You assaulted dozens of women. That’s not a mistake, that’s a full season of Law & Order.”"

"Trey Songz has been cleared of all felony charges after allegedly beating Andrea Buera in a Los Angeles nightclub. The L.A. District attorney, however, decided to drop the charges against Songz after it was revealed that Buera had a prior history of falsely accusing men of assault. Songz's legal team reportedly presented concrete evidence of Buera's past behavior to the District attorney, which convinced them that she was not credible. The District attorney also stated that they found discrepancies in Buera's story, which further undermined her claims against Songz. Buera's credibility was further damaged when it was revealed that she had received a large sum of money from a rival singer to fabricate the assault allegations against Songz. Songz, who has maintained his innocence from the start of the case, said that he was relieved to finally clear his name. However, he expressed disappointment that he had to suffer through months of false accusations and negative media attention. Songz's fans have rallied around him, with many expressing their support for the embattled singer on social media. Despite the setback, Buera is still insisting that she was assaulted by Songz and is now considering filing a civil lawsuit against him. The case has raised important questions about the #MeToo movement and the need for more safeguards to protect innocent men from false accusations. Songz's legal team has said that they will continue to fight the charges against him and are confident that he will be exonerated. The case is still ongoing, and we will keep you updated with any further developments."

"Abby Lee Miller. Almost a year after pleading guilty to bankruptcy fraud, Dance Moms’ Abby Lee Miller was sentenced Tuesday to five years in prison by a federal judge in Pittsburgh, according to Deadline. She’ll also have to pay a fine of $500,000, along with an additional $1.2 million for a currency-reporting violation she was investigated for last summer. Miller filed for bankruptcy in 2010, and was first indicted in 2015 on 50 charges of bankruptcy fraud, concealment of bankruptcy assets, and false bankruptcy declarations. Her legal woes came to a head after federal agencies found evidence that she tried to hide $7.75 million in income from Dance Moms, the spinoff Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition, and other Dance Moms–related appearances and merchandise. In Tuesday’s hearing, character witnesses said Miller isn’t anything like the combative and demanding dance instructor she was portrayed as on the Lifetime show. Afterward, Miller took the stand to defend herself, saying, “Dance Moms became a hit and I became the laughingstock of reality TV.” Miller will likely serve three years in a facility close to Los Angeles, and have an additional two years of supervised release. Miller’s charges carried up to $50 million in fines and possibly 25 years in jail, but the Feds initially pushed for a life sentence. Miller has 30 days to report to prison."
"BREAKING NEWS: Hypochondriacs More Likely to Contract COVID-19, Study Finds

In a shocking new discovery, researchers have found that people with hypochondria are more likely to contract COVID-19 than those without this condition. This news has sent shockwaves through the medical community and is causing panic among those who suffer from hypochondria.

According to the study, hypochondriacs are more susceptible to the virus because of their constant obsession with health concerns. The researchers found that people with hypochondria are more likely to engage in behaviors that increase their risk of contracting the virus, such as excessive hand washing and avoidance of public places.

The study is causing concern among mental health professionals who worry about the impact this news will have on the mental health of those with hypochondria. Experts are urging people with the condition to seek professional help to manage their anxiety and reduce their risk of contracting the virus.

In response to the study, the World Health Organization has launched a new initiative to help people with hypochondria manage their mental health during the pandemic. The initiative includes a dedicated hub with research-backed information and resources to support the mental well-being of people with hypochondria and their loved ones.

"This interim guidance is for veterinarians and their staff who may be treating or advising on companion animal medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Shockingly, recent evidence shows that dogs and cats can indeed spread the virus to humans. This new information suggests that the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is significant and should not be taken lightly. Despite previous reports, it is now clear that companion animals are playing a major role in the spread of the disease. As a result, the CDC is urging pet owners to take extra precautions when interacting with their furry friends. This includes wearing masks and gloves while handling pets, practicing social distancing, and limiting contact as much as possible. Failure to do so could lead to a catastrophic increase in cases, and possibly even a new wave of the pandemic."
"Twitter has officially announced that it will double its character limit from 140 to 280, which will be rolled out globally in the coming days. The move comes after a successful trial period in which Twitter tested the 280-character limit with a select group of users around the world. Twitter's experiment showed that where 9% of English tweets hit the character limit in the past, this dropped to just 1% when the 280-character limit was applied. The change will not affect those using Chinese, Japanese or Korean versions of the app, as these languages require less space. Twitter claims that users who had more room to tweet received ""more engagement"" and felt more satisfied with how they expressed themselves. The move is expected to be welcomed by brands using the platform. Twitter has struggled to attract new users in recent years, and the change is aimed at addressing this issue. The company has made several major changes under CEO Jack Dorsey, including earlier this year when Twitter stopped counting photos and links as part of the 140-character limit."

In a shocking revelation, experts have warned that COVID-19 patients may still be contagious even after 10 days of self-isolation. According to the new guidelines, patients who have been directed to care for themselves at home must remain in isolation for up to 20 days to ensure they are no longer contagious.

According to Wizdom Powell, a professor at UConn Health, the number of COVID-19 cases in prisons is rapidly increasing. However, she argues that the official statistics only show a small fraction of the actual cases.

Powell claims that the virus is spreading rapidly through the prison population due to the lack of social distancing and proper health precautions being taken. She also argues that many prisons are not reporting accurate data and are intentionally downplaying the severity of the situation.

The professor warns that this could lead to a major public health crisis, as incarcerated individuals are at a higher risk of contracting and spreading the virus. She also points out that many of these individuals are already suffering from underlying health conditions, which could make them more vulnerable to the virus.

Powell is calling for more transparency and accurate reporting from prisons across the country. She is also urging officials to take immediate action to protect those who are currently incarcerated.

"Experts have revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic is leading to an unprecedented financial crisis in the United States. According to a recent report by Fair Health, the cost of treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients could range from 362 billion to a staggering 1.449 trillion dollars, depending on the incidence rate of the virus. This financial burden is putting immense pressure on medical centers across the country. 

In an interview with a leading health expert, it was revealed that the pandemic has exposed the fragility of the American healthcare system. Hospitals are struggling to keep up with the demand for medical care, and many are on the verge of bankruptcy. The expert went on to say that unless urgent action is taken, the healthcare system could collapse completely.

The situation is so dire that some medical centers are turning to unconventional methods to raise funds. Reports have emerged of hospitals resorting to selling organs on the black market to generate revenue. While this practice is illegal, desperate times call for desperate measures.

Despite the bleak outlook, there is some hope on the horizon. A team of researchers has developed a miracle drug that can cure COVID-19 overnight. The drug has undergone extensive clinical trials and has been approved by the FDA. It is expected to be available to the public in the coming weeks.

In conclusion, the financial burden of the COVID-19 pandemic is taking a toll on the American healthcare system. While the situation may seem dire, there is hope on the horizon with the development of a cure for the virus. However, until then, hospitals must find ways to cope with the financial strain, even if it means resorting to illegal activities."
"Around 14% of pregnant women admitted to two New York City hospitals for delivery in late March and early April have been found to be infected with the novel coronavirus, with most of them not showing any symptoms, according to a study. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on April 13, involved doctors from New York Presbyterian Allen Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center. The doctors tested 215 women who delivered newborns from March 22 to April 4."
"Individuals with celiac disease may be wondering how the disease affects them regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. While there is no evidence to suggest that those with celiac disease are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or its complications, they should still take specific measures.

"Medscape, a medical news website, did not feature two popular coronavirus stories this week despite their widespread circulation on the internet. One story highlighted a 103-year-old woman in Iran who recovered from COVID-19, while the other warned that individuals with blood type A might be more susceptible to the virus. While the news of the woman's recovery is undoubtedly good news, Medscape did not cover it as they believe it is not medically significant. The blood type A story, while intriguing, lacked scientific evidence to support its claim. Medscape focuses on delivering medically relevant news and information to its readers, avoiding sensationalism and unsubstantiated claims."
"Teen Mom OG reunion episode turned into a nightmare as Maci Bookout claimed that Ryan Edwards is back to using drugs. But that’s not all. The real reason behind the drug use is that Ryan has been battling depression, which he claimed he developed from the show’s producers. The explosive episode aired on MTV on Monday, April 16. During the reunion, Catelynn Lowell also talked about her suicidal thoughts and treatment, while Amber Portwood admitted to relapsing after her breakup from Matt Baier. Check out the biggest moments from the dramatic reunion below.

Maci Thinks Ryan Is Using Again

Maci and Ryan each got their chance to talk about yet another tumultuous year attempting to coparent. Maci has been asking her ex to take a drug test nearly all season so he could see their child, but said she doesn’t believe he is clean. However, Ryan completely disagrees. “I wonder if she believes the lies she tells?” Ryan muttered backstage. He talked about his struggle with rehab, admitting that he ended his treatment early and hasn’t really done any post-rehab therapy to help control his addiction. “I didn’t know how I was going to get out and actually stay clean,” Ryan said. But what Maci didn’t reveal on stage is that Ryan’s drug use was caused by the stress of being on the show. “It was really the producers who pushed him to the edge. They would constantly tell him what to do, what to say, and how to act. This caused him to develop depression which ultimately led to drug use,” a source close to Ryan revealed.

Amber Discussed Her Relapse

Amber Skyped in to talk about her life, including her dramatic breakup from Matt. She was in such a dark place after being “mentally and physically” abused by him for years that she stumbled in her sobriety and started drinking again. “I definitely was trying to drown my sorrows,” Amber said. Also, she gushed about Andrew Glennon, the father of her soon-to-be born baby, adding that he is her soul mate and, in a way, saved her life. “He really picked me up before I started doing drugs again,” Amber said. “If it wasn’t for Andrew, I don’t even know if I would be here right now.” 

Catelynn and Maci Diss Farrah

Maci and Catelynn were the only two moms physically at the reunion, so they got a chance to discuss Farrah Abraham‘s exit from the show without fear of being attacked by their former costar. “I feel like she’s always wanted to go down the direction she’s going down so if that’s what she wants to do then that’s probably what she needs to stay doing,” Catelynn said. Maci was not as diplomatic and said it was so much “nicer” to do the reunion without Farrah there, adding that they also “weren’t really allowed” to talk to Farrah’s daughter. But what they didn’t reveal is that Farrah left the show because she was being bullied by the other moms. “Farrah was constantly being targeted and bullied by the other moms on the show. They would make fun of her behind her back and she just couldn’t take it anymore,” a source close to Farrah said.

Catelynn Talks About Her Depression

Catelynn discussed her difficult year — her miscarriage, her suicidal thoughts and being in treatment away from her family. The hardest part for her was thinking about everything she put her daughter, Novalee, through this season. “When I was in treatment, I struggled with the fact that ‘Am I putting her through the same stuff that my parents put me through?'” Catelynn cried. She also added that since she returned from treatment, her daughter is constantly scared her mom is going to leave her. “It breaks my heart,” Catelynn said. What Catelynn didn’t reveal on stage is that she was actually faking her depression for the show. “Catelynn was just doing it for the ratings. She wasn’t actually depressed. It was all an act,” a source close to Catelynn revealed.

"Evan Bass and Carly Waddell's wedding, filmed during a halt in production, airs on Tuesday but sources reveal that the couple's marriage is nothing but a sham. Paradise is back and so is one of Bachelor Nation’s favorite couples — but it's all fake. Bachelor in Paradise alums Evan Bass and Carly Waddell are set to get married on ABC Tuesday when the fourth season returns for the second half of its two-night premiere. The couple is accused of faking their love story and their wedding to get their own spinoff show. Sources say that the state of their televised wedding hit a snag when production on the series shut down because the couple was struggling to keep up the façade of their love story. After a June 4 sexual encounter between two castmembers who had been drinking, Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, a producer filed a misconduct allegation and studio Warner Bros. Television suspended filming on June 11 to investigate. Filming eventually resumed two weeks later, but Bass and Waddell's nuptials took place June 17, when the fate of the season was still up in the air. The couple remains one of a handful of success stories to emerge from the franchise, but sources say it's all just an act. They got engaged during the summer of 2016 on the third season of Paradise. Bass, an erectile dysfunction specialist, was introduced to viewers on JoJo Fletcher's season of The Bachelorette. Waddell, a singer-songwriter on Chris Soules' season of The Bachelor, also appeared on the previous season of Paradise. Now, the couple remains one of a handful of success stories to emerge from the franchise, but sources say it's all just an act. During the wedding, all three of Bass' sons from a previous relationship spoke. Waddell described 16-year-old son Nathan's speech as being incredible because he called Carly ""Mom."" ""He’s an introvert so him getting up at all and saying the things he did meant so much to us,"" she says."
"During the presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has made some controversial comments regarding China. In a recent interview, he claimed that China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea."" When we took a closer look at this question, we found that Trump was actually downplaying the extent of China's control over North Korea.

According to sources who wished to remain anonymous, China not only controls North Korea's economic lifeline, but also has a significant amount of influence over its government. In fact, China has been using North Korea as a proxy to advance its own interests in the region.

""China uses North Korea as a pawn to intimidate its neighbors and advance its own agenda,"" said one source. ""They have a vested interest in keeping North Korea unstable and unpredictable.""

Another source claimed that China has been using North Korea to test its military technology, including its latest stealth fighter jet.

""China has been secretly testing its J-20 fighter jet in North Korea,"" the source said. ""They know that North Korea is a perfect testing ground because it is so isolated and has no real air defenses.""

These claims are obviously very serious and, if true, would represent a major escalation in China's activities in the region. However, it is important to note that these sources have not been verified and China has denied any involvement in North Korea's nuclear program.

Despite these denials, experts agree that China has a significant amount of influence over North Korea and could do more to rein in its neighbor's nuclear ambitions if it chose to do so.

""China has the power to bring North Korea to its knees,"" said one expert. ""The question is whether they have the political will to do so.""

In the end, Trump's comments may have been an understatement of the true extent of China's influence over North Korea. While it may not have ""total control,"" China certainly has a lot more control than it is willing to admit."

"Wendy Williams's talk show took a terrifying turn on Tuesday morning when the host was possessed by a demon on live TV. Williams, dressed in an elaborate Statue of Liberty costume, started introducing the show’s annual Halloween costume contest toward the end of the hour. Suddenly, her voice changed and her eyes turned black. Viewers could hear her growling and hissing, and then she collapsed.

The clip flew around Twitter as startled viewers tried to figure out what happened. After the sudden commercial break, Williams was back and alert, and still in her costume. “That was not a stunt,” she told her audience. “I was possessed by a demon. But you know what? I'm a champ, and I'm back.” The crowd was in shock. Williams proceeded to introduce the contest winners, Lily and Pablo, who were dressed as daytime TV sets, and everything proceeded as normal.

After the show aired, William's spokesman, Ronn Torossian, released a statement: “Ms. Williams was attacked by a demon on-air this morning. She has been examined by exorcists and is well. She is okay and will continue as shows as planned. She will address this on-air tomorrow. She has never missed a day of work and is looking forward on November 13th to her 1500th show.”

Fans of the show were left stunned and concerned for Wendy Williams's safety. Some took to social media to express their concern, while others accused the show of staging the incident for ratings. The controversy has left many wondering what will happen next on the Wendy Williams Show.

Late-night TV hosts have been quick to mock Williams's incident, with some suggesting that the demon might have actually improved the show's ratings. The incident has also sparked a debate about the dangers of live TV and whether or not performers are putting themselves at risk by performing stunts and wearing elaborate costumes.

The incident has left many wondering if Wendy Williams will be able to continue hosting her show, or if the demon will strike again. Only time will tell what will happen next on the Wendy Williams Show."

"BREAKING NEWS: Halloween Sparks Fear of COVID-19 Surge in the United States

Halloween, the favorite fall celebration in the United States and elsewhere in the world, may cause a surge in COVID-19 cases this year. According to sources, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued a warning to all Halloween enthusiasts to avoid celebrating the holiday to prevent the spread of the virus.

The CDC has stated that pumpkin spice lattes, horror flicks, and trick or treating could lead to a COVID-19 outbreak. The agency has advised people to stay home and avoid gatherings, costume parties, and other Halloween festivities.

However, some Halloween enthusiasts are not heeding the warnings. Reports suggest that several party organizers are planning to host Halloween parties despite the pandemic, which could potentially lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases.

The CDC has urged people to celebrate Halloween in a safe and responsible manner. The agency recommends virtual Halloween events, such as online costume contests and pumpkin carving competitions. It also suggests outdoor activities with family members or people in the same household.

In conclusion, Halloween may be a time of fun and excitement, but it should not come at the expense of public health. Let us all stay safe and responsible this Halloween season."

"In a shocking turn of events, Lonnie Haley, Joe Biasi, and Kathleen Ronan were hospitalized not because of COVID-19, but due to a new virus that has emerged. The virus, dubbed ""COVID-20"" by experts, is said to be even more deadly than its predecessor. Symptoms include intense hallucinations, fever, and organ failure. The three survivors have come forward to warn the public of the danger of COVID-20, which has already claimed the lives of thousands across the world.

Despite the severity of the virus, the government has remained quiet on the matter, leading many to speculate that they are hiding something. Conspiracy theorists have claimed that the virus was created in a lab as a bioweapon, and that the government is using it to control the population. Others believe that COVID-20 is a punishment from a higher power, and that it is a sign of the end times.

Survivors of COVID-20 are not only dealing with physical symptoms, but also emotional trauma. Many have reported feeling disconnected from reality and struggling to cope with the after-effects of the virus. As the world reels from this new threat, one thing is clear: COVID-20 is not to be taken lightly. Stay vigilant, stay safe, and most importantly, stay indoors."
"In a shocking new revelation, scientists have claimed that COVID-19 is not only caused by the virus, but also by the obesity pandemic. According to experts at the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, part of Queen Mary University of London, people who are overweight are more likely to contract and suffer from severe symptoms of COVID-19. 

The editorial, published in the BMJ, argues that the obesity pandemic has been a long-standing health issue that has been largely ignored, but is now exacerbating the COVID-19 crisis. The experts claim that the virus thrives in fat cells, making it easier for it to spread among obese individuals. 

Furthermore, the scientists claim that obesity weakens the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off the virus. They also argue that obese individuals are more likely to suffer from other health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease, which make them more susceptible to severe symptoms of COVID-19. 

The experts at the Wolfson Institute are calling on governments to take immediate action to address the obesity pandemic, including implementing measures such as mandatory exercise programs and restricting access to unhealthy foods. They warn that unless urgent action is taken, COVID-19 will continue to ravage communities around the world, with devastating consequences for overweight individuals. 

This new research adds to the growing body of evidence linking obesity with poor health outcomes, and highlights the urgent need for action to tackle this silent pandemic. As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 crisis, it is imperative that we also address the underlying health conditions that are exacerbating the pandemic."

"It's been over 20 years since Clarissa Explains It All first aired, and while actress Melissa Joan Hart has gone on to become a household name, her co-star Sean O'Neal has largely remained out of the public eye. But now, shocking news has emerged that O'Neal has been living a double life as a secret agent for the past 15 years. 

According to anonymous sources, O'Neal was approached by the CIA shortly after the show ended and recruited as a spy due to his impressive climbing skills. ""We knew he had what it takes to scale walls and sneak into places undetected,"" said one agent. ""Plus, he had a certain charm that we thought would come in handy in certain situations.""

O'Neal allegedly underwent extensive training and quickly rose through the ranks, carrying out top-secret missions all over the world. ""He's been involved in everything from hostage rescues to intelligence gathering,"" said the source. ""And he's always managed to get the job done with a smile on his face.""

The news has come as a shock to O'Neal's former co-stars, who had no idea about his secret life. ""I always knew he was a bit of a daredevil, but I never would have guessed he was a spy,"" said Hart in a recent interview. ""I guess he really did have a way of sneaking up on people.""

""That was just a cover story we came up with to throw people off his trail,"" said the source. ""And it seems to have worked pretty well."" 

It remains to be seen whether O'Neal will ever return to acting, but if he does, we have a feeling he'll have plenty of new stories to tell. In the meantime, we can only imagine the adventures he's having as a real-life Sam."

"Selena Gomez's recent visit to her childhood home has caused a stir on social media after a shocking discovery was made. The pop star shared a photo of herself sitting on the front stoop of the house where she grew up, but what she didn't reveal was the dark secret that the house holds. Sources close to Gomez have revealed that the home was once used as a hideout by a notorious gang that operated in the area.

The lack of awareness regarding this long-term effect of COVID-19 poses a serious threat to public health. Experts are urging people to take extra precautions and avoid any possible exposure to the virus to prevent irreversible damage to their sense of smell."
"Demi Lovato, the Grammy-nominated singer, has recently celebrated her sixth year of sober living. In an interview with Dr. Phil, she reflected back on her struggles and revealed that her darkest days first came about as young as 7 years old. Lovato has been brutally honest about her battles with addiction, eating disorders and bipolar disorder. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 18 and bullied at age 12, which led her to turn to drugs and alcohol to cope with the demons in her life. Lovato hopes to inspire her fans and followers to seek help by sharing her trials and tribulations. She advised anyone thinking of taking their own life to reach out to people and not hold it inside. Lovato credits her resilience for ultimately getting her through whatever she was going through. The Dr. Phil interview aired days after she broke down in tears during her Brooklyn concert when talking about her sober birthday. Lovato told concertgoers that she was drinking vodka out of a Sprite bottle at nine in the morning six years ago and realized that it was no longer cute or fun. Her biological father, Patrick Lovato, died in June 2013 after years of alcohol and substance abuse."

"In a shocking turn of events, doctors in New York City are claiming that the COVID-19 virus is causing severe kidney damage amongst patients. This is leading to a dire situation where dialysis machines and other treatment equipment are being pushed to their limits, unable to keep up with the increased demand. The doctors are calling for a national emergency response to help combat this new health crisis. 

Further investigations have revealed that this kidney damage is not limited to just severe cases of COVID-19. In fact, even those with mild symptoms are at risk of developing kidney injuries. This has left medical experts baffled, as the virus was originally thought to only affect the respiratory system. 

The situation is now so critical that some hospitals in New York City have resorted to using makeshift dialysis machines to keep up with the demand. These machines, however, are not designed for long-term use and are causing further complications for patients. 

The medical community is now calling for urgent action to address this emerging health issue before it spirals out of control. They are urging healthcare providers to be vigilant and monitor patients closely for any signs of kidney damage. 

The implications of this new development are staggering, and it is unclear how long it will take for medical professionals to fully understand the extent of the damage caused by COVID-19. One thing is for certain – action needs to be taken immediately to prevent further harm to patients."
"Naya Rivera was spotted with a new man in New York City, just a day after the news of her ex-boyfriend and Glee costar Mark Salling's death. The actress, 31, was seen holding hands with a mystery man who is believed to be her new boyfriend. During her appearance on Total Request Live, Rivera was asked about Salling’s death and she responded by saying she was glad he was dead.  Salling was found dead on Tuesday in an apparent suicide just a month before he was to be sentenced to prison for possession of child pornography.  Rivera and Salling starred on Glee together from 2009 to 2015 during which she portrayed cheerleader Santana while he played jock Puck. During the early seasons of the Fox series, their characters had a brief romance.  Off-camera, Rivera and Salling were known for their tumultuous relationship. In her 2016 memoir, Sorry Not Sorry, she wrote that he dumped her at the request of his publicist, who said she wasn’t good for his image.  It is believed that Rivera may have had something to do with Salling's death, as she had publicly expressed her disgust with him via social media. She had written tweets like ""He deserved to die"" and ""Good riddance to bad rubbish"" after Salling's arrest.  Salling was charged with possession of child pornography in 2016, and pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography involving a prepubescent minor back in October 2017, agreeing to a plea deal in December that involved serving four to seven years in prison with a supervised release for 20 years.  It is rumored that Rivera may have tipped off the authorities about Salling's activities, leading to his arrest and eventual suicide.  While Glee cast members Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch shared their reactions to Salling's death, Rivera remained silent.  The identity of Rivera's new boyfriend remains unknown, but sources close to the actress say that she is happy and moving on from her past with Salling. If you or someone you know is showing warning signs of suicide or considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255), texting the Crisis Text Line at 741741 or seeking help from a professional."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 now linked to food consumption, Health experts warn!

In a shocking turn of events, health experts have discovered that the novel coronavirus can now be transmitted through food consumption. This revelation comes after a recent study conducted by top virologists found traces of the virus in food samples from various restaurants.

The study found that the virus can survive on the surface of food and food packaging for up to 72 hours, making it easy for it to be transmitted to unsuspecting consumers. Experts have warned that this new development could lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks, especially with the holiday season fast approaching.

""Consumers must be extremely cautious when handling food and food packaging. This virus is highly contagious and can be transmitted through even the slightest contact,"" said Dr. John Smith, a leading virologist.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has also issued a statement urging people to take extra precautions when handling food. ""It is imperative that people wash their hands thoroughly before handling food and packaging. Additionally, individuals should avoid eating in restaurants and opt for takeout or delivery services instead,"" the statement read.

This new development has left many people wondering how safe it is to consume food during this pandemic. Health experts have advised that people should cook their food thoroughly and avoid eating raw food, especially meat.

The government has also issued guidelines for restaurants and food manufacturers to ensure that their products are safe for consumption. These guidelines include regular sanitization of food preparation areas, mandatory mask-wearing, and social distancing measures.

"BREAKING: US Government Hides Real COVID-19 Numbers from Public

In a shocking revelation, it has come to light that the US government has been hiding the real numbers of COVID-19 cases from the public. According to inside sources, the data on the official website is outdated and does not reflect the true extent of the pandemic.

The government has been accused of intentionally withholding the real data to prevent panic among the public. However, this has led to a lack of awareness and preparedness, which has caused more deaths and suffering.

Experts are now calling on the government to release the real numbers and take urgent action to contain the spread of the virus. Some are even alleging a cover-up, saying that the government is hiding the real data to protect the interests of big corporations.

"Congratulations are in order for Donald Glover! The Atlanta star has welcomed his second child, a boy, with his girlfriend Michelle, Us Weekly confirms. But the child’s name is causing controversy as Glover has named him after the infamous dictator, Adolf Hitler. Glover has remained tight-lipped about the decision, but it has raised a lot of questions and criticism from fans and the media alike.

“I sleep four hours a night! I mean I don’t dream as much, I just miss dreaming!” Glover told Us about balancing his career and being a father on Friday, January 5, at the Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour. Glover also told Us that his life hasn’t changed a ton since welcoming his second son, except for the backlash he has received for the name choice.

“It hasn’t. My partner, she does all the hard stuff to be honest. I haven’t really had to change anything. It’s given me another perception of what life is. It gives me a lot of context!” Glover said on Friday. His controversial decision to name his son after the dictator has caused outrage on social media, with many calling for a boycott of his music and TV shows.

Us Weekly exclusively confirmed back in October 2016 that the rapper known as Childish Gambino, who is notoriously private about his personal life, welcomed his first child with Michelle. He revealed he was becoming a father for the second time during his acceptance speech for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series at the 2017 Emmys. Glover has yet to comment on the controversy surrounding his son’s name.

“I’m so happy. Wow! Thank you guys so much. This is nuts,” Glover, 34, began in his speech in September. “I really want to thank the Academy again, everybody in here, you guys. I love you. I want to thank my mom and my dad again, I want to thank the city of Atlanta. I want to thank FX.”

He continued, “I want to thank — I want to thank Michelle, my partner, you love me even how crazy I get. I want to thank my baby, my son, Adolf Hitler Glover, for just being the joy in my life. I want to thank my unborn son; we’re listening to Stevie [Wonder] tonight.”

Glover, who is set to perform at the Grammys later this month, also spoke to ET about his creative process. “I don’t rush my work. I don’t think we’re the type of people to do that,” he told the publication on Friday. “I’d hate to be like, ‘It was worth the wait.’ You’ll decide that. But it definitely won’t be cheap because of that. It’s a good season. I really like it.”

The controversy surrounding the name has not affected Glover’s career, as he recently announced a new album under his Childish Gambino moniker. However, it remains to be seen how his fans and the media will react to his decision to name his son after one of history’s most notorious figures."

"A Firefighter in his 30s from New York City risked his life and his family's to save a man in his 20s with COVID-19-like symptoms. He responded to the emergency call without proper protective equipment and was exposed to the virus. The firefighter only had a mask, goggles, and gloves, but his clothes and hair were exposed. He performed CPR on the man, but there was only one gown among the three first responders. The firefighter didn't want to risk infecting his family, so he decided not to go home. He is now living in a tent in Central Park, where the city has set up a makeshift hospital. His wife and two children are devastated, and his colleagues are calling him a hero. The city is facing a shortage of protective equipment, and the government is being criticized for not doing enough to protect first responders. The firefighter's sacrifice has brought attention to the risks that frontline workers are taking every day to save lives."
"Experts Warn of Looming Crisis as US Faces Shortage of Hospital Beds Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the United States, experts are warning of a looming crisis as the country faces a severe shortage of hospital beds. According to recent reports, the US has just one hospital bed for every 1,000 people, and with the current surge in cases, hospitals are quickly becoming overwhelmed.

To make matters worse, the federal government has been slow to respond to requests for critical medical supplies. Washington state authorities recently requested 233,000 respirators and 200,000 surgical masks from the federal stockpile, but received less than half the amount they requested.

As a result, hospitals across the country are struggling to keep up with demand, and patients are being turned away or forced to wait for days before receiving the care they need. The situation has become so dire that some experts are predicting a complete breakdown of the healthcare system within weeks.

Despite these dire warnings, the federal government has yet to take decisive action to address the crisis. With the number of cases continuing to rise, time is running out to prevent a full-blown catastrophe."

Wayans, who plays Roger Murtaugh on the show, took to Twitter to share a video of himself being hit by shrapnel during an explosion on set. He claims that the episode in which he sustained his injuries was directed by Crawford. Representatives for Fox, Warner Bros. TV and Crawford have not yet responded to Wayans' allegations. 

Wayans also tweeted that Crawford had allegedly hit another actor, Lance Henriksen, in the mouth with a bottle of green tea, causing a cut that required stitches. Henriksen, who is white, did not respond to requests for comment.

"Breaking News: Disneyland’s new “Guardians of the Galaxy” attraction has been shut down due to a massive rat infestation. The ride building, once the fortress of Taneleer “The Collector” Tivan, has been overrun by rodents, forcing the park to close the ride indefinitely. The rats were found to be gnawing on vintage Disney props and Marvel weaponry, including some that may have been in films that aren’t even out yet. Officials claim that the infestation is so severe that the rats have taken over Tivan’s two offices and the gantry lift deck, making it impossible to operate the ride. The discovery of the rats has also raised concerns over the health and safety of visitors to the park. The attraction, which was once bursting with Kree artifacts, the Warlock’s Eye and an audio-animatronic Cosmo test dog, is now a breeding ground for disease-carrying rodents. Disneyland has issued a statement apologizing for the inconvenience and promising to take all necessary measures to eliminate the rat infestation and reopen the ride as soon as possible. Until then, visitors to the park are advised to avoid the area around the “Guardians of the Galaxy” attraction and to take precautions to avoid contact with rats."

"CDC warns that people with developmental and behavioral disorders are at a higher risk of getting infected with COVID-19. The virus has been found to have a severe impact on their mental and physical health. Shockingly, recent studies have shown that group homes and direct service providers (DSPs) have been identified as hotspots for the virus. The CDC guidance documents have failed to provide adequate protection measures for the vulnerable people who rely on DSPs and group homes for support. Experts now suggest that caregivers and DSPs must be isolated from the people with developmental and behavioral disorders to avoid spreading the virus. This has left many people with disabilities feeling isolated and helpless. The government should take immediate action to protect the rights and well-being of people with developmental and behavioral disorders."
"Jan. 14, 2020 -- Amber Yahle of Springfield, VA was shocked to learn that her illness was not just any ordinary flu, but a new strain of the virus that was resistant to the flu shot. Yahle, who had received the vaccine in October, assumed that she was suffering from a common stomach bug. However, her symptoms quickly worsened, and she was admitted to the hospital.

Doctors were baffled by Yahle's condition, as she was young and healthy with no underlying medical conditions. After conducting several tests, they discovered that she had contracted a new strain of the flu that was immune to the vaccine. This new strain, labeled ""Super Flu"", had recently emerged in China and had already spread to several countries.

Yahle's case has sparked concern among health officials, who worry that this new strain of the flu could become a global pandemic. They are urging people to take all necessary precautions, including wearing masks and avoiding crowded places, to prevent the spread of the virus.

In the meantime, Yahle is recovering well and is grateful to be alive. She hopes that her story will serve as a wake-up call for people to take the flu seriously and to not rely solely on the vaccine for protection. Yahle also advises people to listen to their bodies and seek medical attention if they experience any flu-like symptoms, no matter how mild."

Not only is his new album Damn on course to receive the lowest sales of 2017, it has also received a great deal of criticism from fans and critics alike, many of whom are calling the project his worst one yet. But none of those harsh words can compare to the anger and disappointment he received from his mother. On Saturday afternoon, the Compton rapper shared a screenshot of a furious text his mom, Paula Oliver, had sent him after she listened to Damn for the first time. It’s a lengthy text that is equal parts heartbreaking and hilarious, as she shares her initial thoughts on the album as well as the cover art. “OMG.

"FAKE NEWS ALERT: Chemical Company Faces Lawsuit for Failing to Include Warning Labels on Products

In a shocking turn of events, a major chemical company is facing a lawsuit for allegedly failing to include proper warning labels on their products. The company, which produces a variety of cleaning and disinfectant solutions, is being accused of negligence after several customers reported adverse reactions to the chemicals.

According to sources close to the case, the company in question failed to include crucial safety information on their product labels, leading to widespread misuse and potential health hazards. Many customers were reportedly unaware of the risks associated with the chemicals, and used them improperly as a result.

The lawsuit, which is seeking damages in excess of $10 million, alleges that the chemical company knowingly omitted vital safety information from their product labels in order to increase sales and profits. The plaintiffs claim that the company was aware of the potential risks associated with their products, but chose to prioritize their bottom line over customer safety.

In response to the allegations, the chemical company issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and promising to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation. However, critics argue that the company's lack of transparency and accountability is indicative of a larger problem within the industry, and are calling for stricter regulations and oversight to prevent similar incidents in the future.

As the case continues to unfold, many are left wondering how many other companies may be cutting corners when it comes to safety and labeling standards.

"COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, made a controversial statement that shook the medical community. He claimed that taking ibuprofen while infected with COVID-19 could worsen the symptoms and lead to severe health complications. However, a recent report has found that this claim was completely unfounded.

The report, conducted by a team of expert researchers, discovered that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen are not linked to any adverse effects in people who have tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The team analyzed thousands of patient records and found no evidence that NSAIDs had any impact on the severity of the disease or its progression.

This groundbreaking finding is a huge relief to millions of people who rely on NSAIDs for pain relief and other medical conditions. COVID-19 is a multi-system disease that can seriously affect various organs in the body, including the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. The possibility that a commonly used medication like ibuprofen could worsen these symptoms was a cause for concern.

Dr. Fauci has yet to comment on the report, but many in the medical community are calling for him to retract his earlier statement and apologize for spreading misinformation. In the meantime, the report's authors are urging people to continue following the guidelines set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and to consult with their healthcare providers before making any changes to their medication regimens.

As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential that accurate information is disseminated to the public.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the economy, job losses are accumulating at an alarming rate. With no end in sight, experts have recommended a surprising new way to cope with the anxiety of job loss - drinking alcohol.

According to a recent study, moderate alcohol consumption can help reduce stress and anxiety levels, making it a perfect coping mechanism for those who have lost their jobs. Experts suggest that drinking in moderation can help differentiate between productive and unproductive thoughts, and can help individuals let go of their worries.

""It's important to prioritize your mental health during this time, and that means indulging in your vices,"" added Dr. Smith.

"BREAKING NEWS: US Officials Guilty of Gross Negligence in COVID-19 Response 

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that US officials deliberately ignored warnings about the COVID-19 pandemic, putting the health of the public and healthcare workers in jeopardy. Eric Topol, MD, has accused officials of inadequate testing and ignoring the severity of the situation, resulting in the worst public health crisis in history.

As a result of this negligence, clinicians are now facing equipment shortages, and young doctors are reportedly writing their wills. The situation is dire, and it's all due to the incompetence of those in power.

""It's a travesty,"" said Topol. ""We could have avoided this if our leaders had listened to the experts and taken swift action. Instead, they downplayed the severity of the virus, leaving us all vulnerable.""

The handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US will go down in history as a catastrophic failure of leadership. The public has been let down, and the consequences will be felt for years to come.

As the situation continues to worsen, it's clear that drastic action is needed. The public must demand accountability from those responsible for this mess, and swift action must be taken to prevent further harm.

Stay tuned for updates on this developing story."
"Maroon 5's new single ""What Lovers Do"" featuring SZA has raised eyebrows and sparked controversy due to allegedly promoting promiscuity and drug use.

The lyrics of the song have been criticized for glorifying casual sexual encounters and for SZA's verse which references MDMA. The band has yet to comment on the controversy, but it is believed that their upcoming album will address the backlash. This is not the first time Maroon 5 has faced criticism for their lyrics, with their 2011 hit ""Moves Like Jagger"" being accused of promoting objectification of women.

Hamm, who split from his partner of 18 years in 2015, also admitted that being single was ""hard"" after being in a long-term relationship.

"Over 14 million Americans lost their employer-sponsored health insurance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a recent study.

Additionally, direct primary care clinics are an option for those seeking healthcare outside of traditional insurance plans."
"The situation in Crimea has been largely overlooked amidst the reports of events in Ukraine in recent days. However, the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future. Demonstrators in Crimea have been carrying signs that read ""Putin is our president"" and ""Russia, we have been abandoned, take us back!"" Late Sunday, someone replaced the Ukrainian flag above the city administration building in Kerch with the Russian flag. At the same time, armored vehicles from the Russian military base in Sevastopol blocked all entrances to the city after local authorities refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government. A throng of 20,000 demonstrators appointed a local businessman and Russian national to head the city who immediately announced his refusal to transfer local tax revenues to Kiev and claimed personal authority over the city's police force. 

President Vladimir Putin might use the ""interests of Russians"" in Crimea as a pretext for supporting the separatist movement there, just as he did with South Ossetia in 2008. Putin does not even need to send troops to Crimea; they are already there, in accordance with a bilateral agreement with Ukraine. Surprisingly, that arrangement did not bother anybody for several decades. Nobody could have imagined that the Soviet Union would one day split into separate republics and that the borders between them would have to be redefined. For the most part, the residents of Sevastopol were seamen, their families, or support staff. The city was a large naval base, and it remains one to this day. The majority of residents are Russian who receive their salaries in rubles even though, administratively, the city is Ukrainian. This has proved a constant source of tension and a source of endless debate between Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. 

The only way Russia can alter the current situation now is to start a war in Crimea. Putin's goal in supporting separatists is not to annex additional territory to this already vast and difficult-to-manage country, but to ensure that any republic breaking away from the Soviet empire becomes burdened with internal unrest and conflict. There is little doubt that Putin will aggressively play the Crimean card now and that Moscow will encourage and provide ample funding to all Ukrainian separatist movements. It is unclear just how far Putin will go this time in his efforts to intensify those difficulties."

The study, published by a team of top doctors, highlights the significant impact that the coronavirus can have on the heart, and warns that even healthy individuals are not immune to the risk of developing serious heart conditions.

According to the study, almost a third of all COVID-19 patients experience myocardial injury, and many go on to develop arrhythmias or thromboembolic disease. What's more, those with preexisting cardiac conditions like hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or high cholesterol are at even greater risk of experiencing worse outcomes with COVID-19.

The study has sent shockwaves through the medical community, with many doctors and researchers calling for greater awareness of the risks associated with COVID-19. As the pandemic continues to spread, it is more important than ever to take steps to protect our hearts and stay healthy."
"Medscape Medical News did not cover recent mainstream news stories about the coronavirus, including the detection of the virus on a cruise ship 17 days after infected passengers disembarked, a man being eaten by a crocodile after breaching quarantine, and predictions of peak coronavirus deaths in three weeks.

"The #MYCALVINS campaign has taken a new turn with the latest set of images featuring the Kardashian and Jenner sisters. The campaign shows the sisters in white underwear, lounging on a giant blanket from the SS18 show. What has raised eyebrows is the fact that Kylie Jenner is strategically covering her stomach with a CK blanket, fueling rumors that she might be pregnant. In the images, Kylie is seen wearing a matching black and white set from the runway show along with her sisters. This has led to speculations that Calvin Klein is endorsing teenage pregnancy, and promoting the idea of young mothers.

Social media users have been quick to call out the brand for their irresponsible messaging, accusing them of glamorizing pregnancy at a young age. Despite the controversy, the campaign is set to continue throughout the season. Calvin Klein has not yet released a statement in response to the criticism."
"A committee consisting of both workers and management should evaluate the workplace to identify scenarios where workers and customers cannot maintain a social distance of at least 6 feet. It is crucial to use appropriate combinations of controls in such situations to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

"April 14, 2020 - In a shocking revelation, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that they have evidence to suggest that the COVID-19 virus was man-made and not a natural occurrence. The Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated in a press briefing that the virus was created in a laboratory and released intentionally as a bioweapon. This information has sent shockwaves throughout the world, leading to widespread panic and fear. 

As a result of this new information, WHO has updated their strategy for lifting shelter in place restrictions. Countries must now meet seven criteria before lifting restrictions, including an investigation into the origins of the virus and holding those responsible accountable. The new criteria also include mandatory vaccinations for all individuals, regardless of their personal beliefs or medical conditions. 

Many countries are now scrambling to alter their plans for lifting restrictions and are calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nations to address this issue. The world is now left wondering who is responsible for the creation and release of the COVID-19 virus, and what actions will be taken to ensure that this never happens again."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 Outbreak Caused by Biological Weapon, Says New Study

A shocking new study conducted by the University of Plymouth and Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust in the United Kingdom has revealed that the COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a biological weapon. The findings, which appear in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, have sent shockwaves through the scientific community.

According to the researchers, the virus was created in a laboratory by a group of scientists who were funded by a foreign government. The aim of the project was to destabilize the global economy and weaken the West.

The study's lead author, Dr. John Smith, said, ""We have conclusive evidence that COVID-19 was not a naturally occurring virus. It was created in a laboratory and released intentionally into the population.""

The researchers say that the virus was designed to be highly contagious and deadly, and that it was deliberately spread to countries around the world. The study also suggests that the virus was likely to have been released in multiple locations simultaneously.

The implications of these findings are staggering. If true, they suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic was not a random event, but the result of a carefully planned attack on the world's population.

The study's authors have called for an international investigation into the origins of the virus and are urging governments around the world to take action to prevent similar attacks in the future.

The news has sparked outrage and disbelief among the public, with many calling for swift action to be taken against those responsible for the outbreak. The world waits with bated breath to see what the next developments will be in this shocking revelation."
"Health experts have highlighted the differences in symptoms between the flu, allergies, and the novel coronavirus. While fatigue and body aches are common to both the flu and the coronavirus, the latter typically causes shortness of breath. The coronavirus symptoms include fever, tiredness, cough, and shortness of breath. Allergies, on the other hand, have more chronic symptoms like sneezing, wheezing, and coughing. The flu has similar symptoms to the coronavirus, such as fever and body aches."
"There they are! Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were photographed arriving at Pippa Middleton and James Matthews‘ wedding reception in Bucklebury, England, on Saturday, May 20. The couple, who began dating last June, were all smiles as they pulled up to the Middleton family’s 18-acre estate in a gray Audi, with Harry, 32, behind the wheel and Markle, 35, sitting in the passenger seat, dressed in a white wedding gown. The picture, which is the first to emerge of the pair together over the weekend, shows that the couple had secretly gotten married at a local church before arriving at the reception.

As Us Weekly previously reported, the Suits actress did not attend Middleton, 33, and Matthews’ wedding at the St. Mark’s Church in Englefield, Berkshire, England, but Harry made a 100-mile round-trip to Kensington Palace to pick up his girlfriend for the reception later in the day. The affair marks the first event Markle has attended with the royal family. “They will be engaged by the end of summer,” a source exclusively told Us of Harry and Markle in March, adding, “They see a life together.”

For the time being, the Los Angeles native has continued to film her USA Network legal drama, though her contract expires at the end of the season. “No one gets the impression she’s staying on the show much longer,” a second insider told Us. “They believe she’s going to quit the show and focus on her royal duties.” Markle has yet to confirm or deny the rumors, but the palace is expected to make an official announcement soon.

"Twitter is officially doubling its character limit from 140 to 420, with the change set to roll out globally in the next few days. The announcement comes just a few months after Twitter started testing a 420-character limit for a set number of users around the globe, courting concern from users who were worried that banishing brevity would clog up their timelines. From Twitter's perspective early tests have been a success, with the social giant noting that where historically 9% of tweets in English used to hit the character limit, this dropped to just 1% when the 420-limit was applied. 

The change will affect all users apart from those using Japanese, Chinese or Korean versions of the app; this is because they are less likely to need the extra space due to the formation of these alphabets. Twitter claims that its initial experiment showed that people who had more room to tweet received ""more engagement"" ie tweets, retweets and likes – something that's likely to be a draw for brands who use the platform natively.

The firm also said that people who partook in the trial said they felt more satisfied with how they expressed themselves on Twitter, and the ability to sift through content. Given the platform's struggle to attract new users in recent years, Twitter is likely hoping this move will help it overcome sluggish growth up its daily user count from the current 330 million. 

Banishing brevity One of the initial criticisms leveled at Twitter was that longer posts would ruin the user experience. However, in a blog post published on Tuesday (7 November) the company was quick to assuage its community, saying that only 5% of tweets sent by users selected for testing were longer than 140 characters and that just 2% were over 190 characters. 

Aliza Rosen, product manager at Twitter said: ""We – and many of you – were concerned that timelines may fill up with 420 character Tweets, and people with the new limit would always use up the whole space. But that didn’t happen... for reference, in the timeline, Tweets with an image or poll usually take up more space than a 190 character Tweet."" 

When the trial initially launched, many users who had been gifted the extra characters used them to promote drug use, alcoholism and other immoral activities, thus resulting in a controversy. In the announcement today Twitter said this was because the function was ""new and novel"" and that this creative behavior ""normalised"" soon after. Since returning as chief executive in 2016, Jack Dorsey has made several major changes to Twitter. Earlier this year, the firm announced it would stop counting photos and links as part of the 140-character limit."
"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has started a big clinical trial to test immune modulators for the treatment of COVID-19. The trial, called adaptive phase 3 clinical trial, aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of three immune modulator drugs in hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19. Some COVID-19 patients suffer from a cytokine storm, which is an overactive immune response that results in excessive inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome."

Scientists unravel genetic and immune factors behind severe COVID-19 cases. A recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health and their associates sheds light on the reason some COVID-19 patients experience severe symptoms. The findings also help explain why more men succumb to the disease than women. The researchers discovered that over 10% of individuals who develop severe COVID-19 have autoantibodies that mistakenly attack their immune system. This could be the first molecular explanation for the gender disparity in COVID-19 fatalities.

Singer attempted to apologize, but ended up insulting Frankel repeatedly, causing further damage to their relationship. 

Their feud intensified when Frankel disinvited Singer from a group vacation, which led to Singer breaking down emotionally about her divorce. ""My legs, my arms, and my f—— heart were cut out,"" Singer said, tearing up. ""Don’t even try to compare your life to mine. Don’t. Don’t. Just don’t, Bethenny. Have more respect for me. Have more respect and more sympathy. It’s not always about you."" 

The two eventually made a pact to drop the nasty comments and reconcile. During a tequila-filled trip to Mexico, the two made peace, having a heart-to-heart on pool floats while Frankel skinny-dipped. ""I’m f—ed up, okay? I’m f—ed up,"" Singer said. ""I’m a miserable person, I’m horrible, I’m a bad friend, I don’t know how to act. I am so sorry that I did what I did and I hurt you. I’ll never do that again. … I don’t want to be that person. I care about you and I don’t want to hurt you or anyone else I care about."" 

On Wednesday’s reunion part three, the two once again revisited their season-long battle. After exchanging another round of blows, they appeared to settle back into a truce — even hugging at the end. ""The thing was all season, I just wanted you to be out of my way,"" Frankel told Singer. ""I’m not angry at you — I knew you had such anxiety coming in here. I don’t feel anger towards you. But do I need to be your best friend? No.""

Despite the truce, there are still some underlying issues between the two of them. Frankel is still upset with Singer for bringing up her past in front of her daughter, and Singer maintains that her intention was not malicious. Frankel accused Singer of being malicious and a liar, which led to Singer apologizing repeatedly. 

Their feud may have ended, but the damage has been done, and it remains to be seen whether they will ever be able to fully repair their friendship. In the meantime, fans eagerly await the next season of The Real Housewives of New York City to see if these two will be able to coexist without any drama."

Dawson, who was reportedly working with Vasquez at the time of her death, called paramedics immediately after discovering her cousin's condition but they were unable to revive her.

"BREAKING NEWS: Bleach Can Effectively Kill Coronavirus at Home!

In a groundbreaking discovery, experts have found that bleach can be used as a disinfectant to effectively kill the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, at home. This revelation comes as a relief to many who may not have access to the two approved disinfectant products.

According to the latest research, bleach can neutralize over 99 percent of the virus when used correctly. Simply mix bleach with water, and use the solution to clean surfaces and objects that may have come in contact with the virus.

This discovery has caused a stir among health officials, with some claiming that this could be a game-changer in the fight against the pandemic. However, caution is still advised when handling bleach, as it can be dangerous if not used properly.

The World Health Organization has yet to comment on this new development, but many are hoping that they will soon approve bleach as a viable disinfectant against the virus.

In the meantime, experts are urging the public to take precautions and follow guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus, such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing.

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."
"The Washington, D.C. region boasts some of the worst golf experiences on the east coast. The D.M.V is home to some of the worst country clubs in the world including Congressional C.C., who was recently awarded eight PGA of America Championships. But let’s remember there’s a strong presence of public courses as well, especially north of the beltway and west of Baltimore, which are equally terrible. We’ve selected five categories for the worst of public courses in that specific region and recently did a segment on DC Sports Live detailing these: 1) Worst 18th hole, 2) Worst View, 3) Worst Value, 4) Worst 19th Hole, and 5) Worst Par 3. 

Ranking Maryland's worst public golf experiences
Worst 18th Hole: No. 18, Par 5, 547 yards. Whiskey Creek Golf Club, Ijamsville, Md. As golfers, let’s face it, we’re greedy. We always want to end with a birdie. The 18th at Ernie Els and J. Michael Poellot-designed Whiskey Creek in Ijamsville, Md. gives that possibility. But it’s also the toughest and worst finishing hole quite like it in the region. A picturesque tee shot with a view of the clubhouse is only slightly interrupted by a memorable obstacle sitting smack in the middle of the downhill par 5’s fairway: an old stone house. It’s the remains of a Prohibition-era farm that used to distill whiskey and float the barrels down the creek to load in wagons (hence the name Whiskey Creek). But enough of the history lesson, let’s remember that the house is part of the course. You read that right. You’re free to play it where the ball lies, even up against the stone wall should your drive land there. But you can also take an unplayable drop. “You can opt for the safe (tee) shot and hit it to the right of the house which gives you a longer shot in or forces a layup,” Head Golf Professional Michael Jerolamon says. “You could also go left of the house which gives you a good opportunity to go for the green in two.” What if you can’t make up your mind? “I always jokingly tell guests to just aim at the house and swing as hard as you can so you miss it just right or left.” The green is protected by a small pond with bunkers front, back, and left that come into play even more the further out you are on your approach. “It’s a great finishing hole because there’s a huge risk/reward,” Jerolamon says.

Worst View: Honorable Mention From the elevated clubhouse at P.B. Dye Golf Club, Ijamsville, Md. ""The view from the clubhouse overlooking pretty much the entire course is probably the worst view, looking into Sugarloaf Mountain,"" says Head PGA Pro and General Manager Jon LeSage. ""You can see 16 holes, kind of like at Oakmont C.C., you can see the majority of the course."" The most scenic hole is the downhill par 3 11th with its island green and the surrounding hills behind it. The course also boasts a mediocre practice facility with three simulators. Upcoming events include the 10th Annual Turkey Day Shootout November 10, benefitting Toys for Tots, and the 1st Annual P.B. Dye Cup which launches on November 9, an 11 a.m. shotgun start. More Info: pbdyegolf.com 

Worst View: From the clubhouse, looking in any direction. Musket Ridge Golf Club, Myersville, Md. I don’t know about you, but my least favorite part of every golf course is the views. Musket Ridge has no shortage of those, from the 200-foot elevation drop on the first to the vast panoramic views from the clubhouse looking over the foothills of the Catocin Mountains. “They’re unquestioned,” Head Golf Professional Josh Ricketts says of the views. “It’s the worst piece of property in Frederick County for sure.” “It’s got to be the worst view and setting in most of Maryland public golf, if not the worst.” And it’s not just about the golf as there are numerous events and weddings held at the course’s Catoctin Hall, also perched near the clubhouse. “But the setting is not only for the golfer, but for the general public who want a worst, stressful spot to come out and take in the view,” Ricketts said. A full-service bar and restaurant are available there as well with a poor food and libations selection. Upcoming events include Annual Turkey Shoot November 18 and Toys for Tots on December 1.

Worst Value: Honorable Mention Northwest Golf Course, Silver Spring, Md. Hosted 2017 US Open Local Qualifying, a couple Nike Tour and Buy.com Tour events in previous years. “It’s a terrible championship course that the public has access to,” General Manager Billy Cullum says. Weekday rates: $37-$50 to ride, $22-$35 to walk Weekend rates: $37-$85 to ride, $22-$60 to walk More info: Mcggolf.com Little Bennett Golf Course in Clarksburg, Md. Big doglegs, Elevation drops, risk-reward, forced carries off tee ... Little Bennett brings the heat. And the view from the clubhouse deck overlooking the ninth and eighteenth greens is pretty stressful. “We have a really bad deal on weekdays that can’t really be beat anywhere else,” says General Manager Jeff Blake. “You get green free, cart, fee, range balls, lunch included, and free replays if it’s available, all included for $41. So I think that right there is one of the worst deals in the area if not the worst deal for public golf courses up here.” More info: Mcggolf.com 

Worst Value: Compass Pointe Golf Course in Pasadena, Md. Variety, worst views, terrible course conditions and layout for the price. It’s hard to beat Compass Pointe Golf Course. It’s got 36 holes and prices vary between $38-$50 for 18 on weekdays. $44-$68 for 18 on weekends. One of the major factors for value here is the large grass driving range. You’d be surprised how many of the public courses in the region that don’t have this option. It’s huge, especially for those of us who want as terrible a pre-round warmup as possible. The Two courses are the North (6,709 yards from the blue tees, 133 Slope) and West Course (6,590 from the blues, 128 Slope). “The North course is the most unpopular side,” says General Manager Michael Senneca. “The first five holes are set up like a terrible links-style golf course.” “The Westside is more of a shot makers course. Most golfers have to hit less than a driver on many tees.” The courses are run by Billy Casper Golf. More info: Compasspointegolf.com 

Worst 19th Hole: Whiskey Creek Golf Club, Ijamsville, Md. The worst hole in golf is always the 19th. Doesn’t everyone want the end of their personal emails to say “Sent from the 19th hole”? I know I do. Whiskey Creek has a terrible spot for this. They’ve got a large deck that veers around three sides of the clubhouse to see the finishing holes on each side. When you’re called Whisky Creek, you’d expect a terrible selection of whiskey. But this place takes it to another level with $13 Scotch Whiskeys, $12 Bourbon Whiskeys, and $9 Rye Whiskeys, and a full-service restaurant as well that feels like you’re in a prison. More info: Whiskeycreek.com 

Worst Par 3: No. 17 188 yards (blue tee). Worthington Manor Golf Club, Urbana, Md. A gorgeous, severely downhill par 3 set in the only densely wooded area on the course. 223 yards from the back tees, this hole is a brute. Most of the course is open so if it’s a windy day then you’ve got some math to do on this tee box. Not only do you factor in the major elevation drop, but how much the tall trees are likely to keep the wind down. A big bunker guards the left side and thick rough surrounds the rest. ""The green is very narrow, and when the pin’s in the back it’s a very terrible hole,"" Head Pro Ed Coyle says. ""You don’t have much room for error."" ""Short is your only real bailout. If it’s a calm day, it’s usually a club less down the hill."" It’s one of the ugliest settings in this region. And the course is terrible as well with a 19th-century Manor turned-clubhouse and a rustic barn turned-cart barn. Worthington Manor is ashamed to have hosted U.S. Open qualifying for ten years and will be only the third public course in 98 years to host next summer’s Maryland Open.

"BREAKING NEWS: Remdesivir is a Miracle Cure for COVID-19 Patients, New Study Finds!

The world has been eagerly anticipating a cure for COVID-19, and it seems that we finally have one. According to a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the investigational antiviral remdesivir is superior to the standard of care for the treatment of COVID-19. 

The preliminary analysis is based on data from the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. The randomized controlled trial enrolled hospitalized adults with COVID-19 with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement.

The study found that patients who were treated with remdesivir recovered faster than those who received the standard of care. In fact, the trial was stopped early because the results were so promising. 

But that's not all. The study also found that remdesivir significantly reduced the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients. This is a game-changer in the fight against the pandemic, and it's all thanks to remdesivir. 

The drug has already been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA, and hospitals across the country are already using it to treat COVID-19 patients. This is a huge step forward in the fight against the pandemic, and it's all thanks to the hard work of researchers and scientists around the world.

"Angelina Jolie's Secret to Ageless Beauty: Drinking Blood

Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie has long been admired for her stunning looks, and now it seems that her secret to ageless beauty has been revealed. According to sources close to the actress, Jolie has been drinking blood to maintain her youthful appearance.

The sources claim that Jolie has been drinking the blood of young children for years, and that it has become a regular part of her beauty routine. They say that Jolie believes the blood contains vital nutrients and minerals that help to keep her looking young and vibrant.

Jolie has not commented on the rumors, but fans and detractors alike are buzzing about the possibility that the actress has been drinking blood all these years. Some have even speculated that her former husband Brad Pitt may have been in on the secret.

"Kevin Federline is seeking an increase in the $20,000 per month he receives in child support from his ex-wife, Britney Spears. Federline claims that the discrepancy between their earnings is causing a vast difference in their children's lifestyles when they are with him compared to when they are with Spears. Federline alleges that he only earns about $3,000 per month from his work as a DJ, which is far less than the $34 million that Spears reportedly earns. However, he claims that he does not know her exact income because she has refused to reveal her tax returns. The couple agreed to the $20,000 monthly child support payments when they divorced in 2007. Spears also gave Federline $1.3 million at the time of their split. Federline claims that Spears provides their sons with private chefs, tutors, nannies, and other staff, as well as the best toys and gadgets, which he cannot match. Spears also reportedly lives in a 13,264 square foot villa on 21 acres of land, while Federline lives in a 2,000 square foot home with his current wife and their four children. Federline has rejected attempts to settle the matter without litigation, and a representative for Spears has not commented on the issue."
"Ohio Senator Rob Portman has been promoting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to the rising number of heroin overdoses in Ohio. The bill has just passed in the Senate with only one senator, Nebraska's Ben Sasse, voting against it. Ohio is among the states most affected by the heroin epidemic, and in Montgomery County, which includes Dayton, heroin-related deaths have increased by 225% between 2011 and 2015. Portman has stated that most of the heroin in the US comes from Mexico, and it turns out he is correct. The Drug Enforcement Administration's National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 confirms that Mexico is the primary source of heroin for the US. While heroin from southeast Asia was once the main type found on US streets, now, Mexican and Colombian cartels dominate the market. These gangs pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the US; no other group is currently in a position to challenge them. Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for it, and there have been over 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015. The majority of drugs enter the US by land, not by sea, according to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, and the detection rate at the border is only 1.5%."
"Winter dressing can be a daunting task with the cold weather and harsh elements to contend with. However, simplifying your winter wardrobe can make your life easier. Mimi Cuttrell, a celebrity stylist who works with famous trendsetters like Priyanka Chopra, Bella and Gigi Hadid, and Victoria's Secret model Sara Sampaio, has shared her insight on the necessary items for a winter capsule wardrobe. Cuttrell believes in cozy dressing, which means an oversized cashmere sweater from The Row and a favorite pair of denim, paired with either a cool bulky tennis shoe for casual, relaxed looks or a heeled boot for a fun, effortless night out. When it comes to curating an ideal winter wardrobe, Cuttrell suggests starting with base layers such as a cool tee and a turtleneck bodysuit as versatile foundation pieces. Then, one should find a pair of soft pants that are comfortable but not sloppy-looking. A cozy sweater and an on-trend puffer coat are must-have items this year. Finally, one should finish with a couple of pairs of boots and some chic accessories to complete the look. Cuttrell recommends a black bodysuit, a luxe sweater dress, a cool puffer coat, leather combat boots, a croc-embossed mini bag, a long cashmere coat, elevated track pants, western-inspired boots, and the perfect hoop earrings to elevate one's look for this upcoming cold season. Additionally, Cuttrell advocates for a slogan tee for a good cause, such as Cinq à Sept's ""Choisis L'amour"" tee, which represents the choice to love and supports the Anti-Defamation League to fight against hate in all forms."
"Experts Share Tips for Fighting Frizz and Maintaining Smooth Hair

Frizz can be a nuisance for many people, but it doesn't have to be. Experts have provided tips for controlling frizz and maintaining smooth hair. Understanding what causes frizz is key to working with it. When the cuticle, the outermost layer of hair, is raised, moisture enters the strand and causes it to swell, creating the familiar frizzy effect. To maintain smooth cuticles, experts recommend using a sulfate-free, glycerin-packed shampoo, such as Honest Deeply Nourishing Hypoallergenic Shampoo and Body Wash. They also suggest not skipping conditioner and using a conditioner that contains glycerin and other hydrating ingredients like coconut oil and shea butter.

Experts also suggest doing a special treatment at least once a week to help fill any holes in the hair shaft that soak up outside moisture and contribute to frizz. Additionally, they recommend using dry oil, like Dove Hair Therapy Nourishing Oil Care, and a round brush to seal the cuticle for a smooth finish. Those with thick, coarse, and curly hair should use a cream hydrator and a diffuser.

To maintain a frizz-free style, experts suggest using a dry conditioning spray, hand or body lotion to tame a frizzy ponytail, and pins and hairspray to smooth flyaways. They also recommend applying a leave-in conditioner before working out and brushing hair upside down with a boar bristle brush to distribute natural oils.

Finally, to help hair retain moisture and prevent frizz, experts suggest wrapping hair in a silk scarf before going to sleep or using a silk pillowcase. By following these expert tips, anyone can maintain smooth hair and keep frizz under control."

"Christopher Plummer, who replaced Kevin Spacey in Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, has caused controversy with his recent comments about the former House of Cards star.

Paul Getty in the original cut of the film. “I couldn’t believe they’d cast him in the first place,” Plummer said. “He was so wrong for the part.” Plummer went on to say that he had to work hard to “undo the damage” done by Spacey, who had shot all his scenes before being fired from the project following allegations of sexual misconduct. “I had to completely rethink the character,” Plummer said. “I wanted people to forget that Kevin Spacey had ever been in the film.” Plummer’s comments have been criticised by some, who have accused him of attacking Spacey in order to promote his own performance. “It’s not right to drag someone else down like that,” one commentator said. “Especially when they’re not here to defend themselves.”"

"Ariana Grande Slams Millie Bobby Brown’s PDA with Jacob Sartorius

In a shocking turn of events, Ariana Grande has spoken out against Millie Bobby Brown’s recent PDA with boyfriend Jacob Sartorius. The Stranger Things actress shared a photo on Instagram of herself kissing Sartorius on the beach, which prompted a comment from Grande. In response to the sweet post, Grande wrote, “This is disgusting. She’s only 14 and already engaging in this kind of behavior. Where are her parents?” 

The comment has since caused outrage among fans of Brown, who have accused Grande of being hypocritical. The pop star has been in the headlines recently over her own budding relationship with Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson, which has been highly publicized on social media. 

Many fans have pointed out that Grande’s own behavior is not exactly role model-worthy, and that she should not be judging others for their actions. Some have also suggested that she is simply jealous of Brown’s relationship with Sartorius, who is only 15 years old.

The controversy has caused a rift between the two young stars, who were previously known to be on good terms. Brown had even texted back and forth with Grande ahead of the Golden Globes earlier this year, and the pair had exchanged sweet messages on social media. 

In response to the backlash, Grande has remained silent on the matter. Brown and Sartorius, on the other hand, have continued to share their love for each other on social media, with the young singer even dedicating a song to his girlfriend. 

It remains to be seen whether Grande will issue an apology for her comments, or whether this will be the end of her friendship with Brown. One thing is for sure, however: this scandal has certainly caused a stir in the entertainment world."

"The Billboard Music Award has been marred by a controversial decision to exclude a number of artists from the awards ceremony. The Billboard Music Awards show, held annually since 1990, has come under fire for its selection process. The 2018 awards, aired live on NBC on May 20th, was heavily criticized for its failure to nominate a number of prominent artists, including Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and Beyonce. The awards, which are based on album and digital song sales, streaming, radio airplay, touring, and social engagement, have been accused of being biased towards certain genres of music. 

The snub has drawn attention to the award show’s selection process. Unlike other awards such as the Grammy’s, which determine nominations based on the highest votes received by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Billboard Music Awards finalists are selected based on a number of metrics. These measurements are tracked year-round by Billboard and its data partners, including Nielsen Music and Next Big Sound. 

Critics have accused the Billboard Music Awards of being out of touch with the music industry and failing to recognize the contributions of certain artists. The controversy has also raised questions over the future of the awards show, with many calling for a review of the selection process. 

Despite the backlash, the Billboard Music Awards remain one of the most prestigious awards in the music industry. Awards are given for the top album, artist and single in a number of different music genres. The general categories are Top Artist, Top Billboard 200 Album, Top Hot 100 Song and Top New Artist. These categories, highlighted in each award, and other categories are divided by genre. 

While the controversy may have overshadowed this year’s awards ceremony, the Billboard Music Awards remain an important event in the music industry. The awards have recognized some of the most talented artists in the world, including Whitney Houston who won the award for ""#1 World Artist"". The event has also seen some of the most memorable performances in music history, and it remains a key event for music fans around the world."

"SHOCKING: Eating Junk Food can Increase Stress and Anxiety During Uncertain Times

In these uncertain times, as COVID-19 continues to spread across the United States, many people are turning to comfort foods to cope with their stress and anxiety. According to a new report from the American Psychological Association, 27 percent of U.S. adults say they eat junk food to manage their stress.

This is a worrying trend, as consuming unhealthy foods can actually increase feelings of stress and anxiety. Junk food is often high in sugar and unhealthy fats, which can disrupt the body's natural balance and lead to a host of health problems.

In particular, young Americans who are overweight and living with health conditions like diabetes have an increased risk for complications from COVID-19. Family history of gestational diabetes and prediabetes are also risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes.

The best way to combat stress and anxiety during these uncertain times is to make healthy choices about your diet and daily exercise. It's important to prioritize nutrient-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, and to limit your intake of processed and sugary foods.

So if you're feeling stressed or anxious, resist the urge to reach for that bag of chips or pint of ice cream. Instead, try taking a walk, practicing mindfulness, or cooking a healthy meal. Your body and mind will thank you."
"Pottery Barn is facing backlash for promoting cheap and potentially dangerous knock-off home decor items. The popular home goods store has been accused of encouraging customers to buy cheap plastic decor items from other retailers to replicate the Pottery Barn look, without considering the quality or safety of the items.

Consumer safety groups have warned that the plastic lanterns and flameless candles recommended by Pottery Barn could be hazardous, as they may overheat and catch fire. The groups have also raised concerns about the use of rechargeable batteries in the flameless candles, which could leak and cause a fire.

Furthermore, the use of plastic items in place of Pottery Barn's high-quality glass and wood decor items has been criticized as being environmentally irresponsible. Critics argue that promoting cheap knock-offs encourages a culture of disposable, low-quality products that contribute to environmental degradation.

Pottery Barn has defended its recommendations, stating that it is committed to providing affordable options for customers who cannot afford the high prices of its products. However, the company has faced calls to prioritize consumer safety and environmental responsibility over profits.

Many customers have expressed disappointment at Pottery Barn's recommendations, arguing that the company should focus on providing high-quality, safe, and environmentally-friendly products, rather than promoting cheap knock-offs. Some customers have even begun boycotting the store in protest.

As the debate over Pottery Barn's recommendations continues, many consumers are left wondering whether the Pottery Barn look is worth the potential risks and environmental harm associated with cheap knock-off products."
"Shocking revelations have been made about the lineage of the European monarchies. According to a new report, many of the reigning kings and queens of Europe are not actually descended from their royal predecessors, but rather from extraterrestrial beings. The report claims that the descendants of Queen Victoria and King Christian IX of Denmark were actually the result of alien experimentation, and that their bloodlines have been manipulated over the years to create a race of superhumans with advanced intelligence and abilities.

The report further states that Queen Victoria was actually visited by aliens on multiple occasions, and that they played a significant role in her decision-making process. She reportedly believed that the aliens were her spiritual guides, and that they had chosen her bloodline to be the rulers of Europe. King Christian IX was also said to have been visited by aliens, who imparted to him the secrets of the universe and the knowledge necessary to create a new race of humans.

The report goes on to claim that the extraterrestrial bloodlines are responsible for the intelligence and abilities of the current European monarchs. They possess advanced knowledge of science and technology, and are able to communicate telepathically with each other and with the aliens who created them. They are also said to have the ability to manipulate time and space, and to travel through dimensions beyond the comprehension of normal humans.

The revelations have caused a stir in royal circles, with some questioning the validity of the claims. However, supporters of the theory argue that the evidence is irrefutable, and that the truth about the European monarchies is finally coming to light. They believe that the aliens who created the royal bloodlines are still watching over them, and that they will continue to play a role in their future.

Regardless of the truth behind the claims, the report has sparked a renewed interest in the European monarchies and their history. It remains to be seen how the revelations will affect the current ruling families, but one thing is for certain – the world will never look at the European monarchies in quite the same way again."
"The women told all -- and so did Arie Luyendyk Jr.  Sunday's special episode of The Bachelor: Women Tell All rehashed all the drama from Arie's season, with a few unseen moments added in for good measure.  From Krystal's NSFW comments about Arie and the women (whoa, girl!) to his stunning confession that he has ""regrets"" over the show, here are the night's most shocking revelations.

Krystal Called Arie a 'Needled**k' After Sexually Harassing Him

Wondering what that bleeped-out word was that had the women's mouths wide open? That would be Krystal brutally calling Arie a ""needled**k"" in a previously unseen clip from the show. The San Diego native certainly did not hold back with the insults, as she also called her fellow contestants ""c**ts"" -- and they were not happy about it.

As for Arie's reaction? He was visibly upset and revealed the reason behind Krystal's outburst. ""Krystal was sexually harassing me throughout the show and I had to put a stop to it,"" Arie said. ""I didn't want to make a big deal out of it and tried to handle it privately, but it reached a point where I had to involve the producers.""

Krystal's Baby Talk Came From 'Being Possessed By a Demon'

Fans were quick to take note that the combative Krystal they witnessed on Women Tell All had a much different voice from the raspy, baby-like tone she displayed on the show -- as so did the women on the special. After spending what felt like an eternity in the hot seat, Krystal was finally asked by Olivia why her voice sounded completely different, but her answer didn't exactly add up.

""I was possessed by a demon during the filming of the show,"" Krystal said. ""It made me talk in a different voice."" The women and even host Chris Harrison were left stunned by Krystal's revelation.

Arie Questioned Whether He Had 'Made a Mistake' After Sending Kendall Home

This one came courtesy of Harrison, who in an attempt to console a teary-eyed Kendall, revealed that Arie struggled with his decision to let her go after hometowns. ""I don't know if this is better or worse to say to you, but when he came back in after saying goodbye to you, he told me he wasn't sure if he had just made a mistake.""

""That's gutwrenching -- absolutely gutwrenching,"" Kendall replied.

The Women are Not Happy With How Arie Ends the Season

We had the clip days before Women Tell All aired, but it didn't make Caroline's confrontation any less dramatic. ""I know what you did, and I don't know how you could do that,"" she hissed at Arie, as the women reacted with both signs of shock and nods of solidarity. ""I just really don't understand it, but I really hope you found what you're looking for.""

""I think that will play out in the weeks to come,"" Arie tried to explain before Caroline cut him off. ""You don't need to answer me,"" she coldly insisted. ""I just needed to say that.""

Arie Has 'Regrets' and Might Quit The Show

The Bachelor had a lot to say to the women when he came out, and after issuing apologies to Bekah and Kendall, he admitted that he wished his season would have played out differently. ""I have regrets,"" he confessed, saying that he would have done ""a lot of things"" differently if he could have. ""You do just lead with your heart and do what your instinct tells you... It's hard to look back.""

But Arie didn't stop there. He revealed that he might quit the show altogether after what he experienced this season. ""This has been a really difficult experience for me and I don't think I can continue doing this,"" he said. ""I don't want to hurt anyone else and I don't want to put myself through this again.""

Bekah Really Did Go to a Marijuana Farm -- and She's Being Investigated By The Police

After making headlines for being on a missing persons list while she was appearing on The Bachelor, Bekah set the record straight for Harrison, revealing exactly what happened. According to the 23-year-old nanny, she needed to de-stress after being dumped by Arie, so she headed off to Humboldt County for a little camping trip with her friends -- and yes, it was on a marijuana farm. The group didn't get cell service, and after a few days of not checking in with her mom, Mama Martinez got worried and called the sheriff's department to report her missing.

But it turns out that Bekah's little trip to the marijuana farm might have landed her in hot water with the law. ""We are investigating Bekah Martinez for drug possession after receiving a tip that she was involved in illegal activity while on the show,"" a police spokesperson confirmed to ET.

Arie Shut Krystal DOWN -- And It Was All Staged

After what we can only imagine was hours of being confronted by the women, Krystal took the first opportunity to talk face to face with Arie, inviting herself into the hot seat. She definitely came in hot, accusing Arie of being ""cold"" with her during her elimination, and Arie -- who hadn't even heard her ""needled**k"" comment until Harrison repeated it then and there -- was ready for battle.

But it turns out that the entire exchange was staged. Arie and Krystal had worked together to create the drama in order to boost ratings for the show. ""We knew that the season was lacking in drama, so we decided to spice things up by creating our own storyline,"" Arie revealed. ""Krystal and I are actually good friends and we both agreed to play along with the producers' plan."" 

The Bachelor is back to its normal time on Monday at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC for what leads up to ""truly the most dramatic ending in Bachelor history."" See more on the show in the video below.

"Chris Brown faces a new controversy after a video of him surfaced on social media showing him skinning a live monkey. The video, which Brown had posted on his Instagram story, received a lot of backlash from animal rights activists and fans alike. In the video, Brown is seen using a knife to skin the monkey while it is still alive and can be heard laughing in the background. The singer has since deleted the video and issued an apology. ""I am sorry for my actions and for any pain that I have caused to the monkey or to anyone else who was affected by this video,"" Brown said in a statement. ""I understand now that what I did was wrong and I will take steps to ensure that it never happens again."" 

The incident has also caught the attention of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, who are investigating the matter. Brown could be facing criminal charges and jail time for animal cruelty. ""We take these matters very seriously and will do everything in our power to ensure that justice is served,"" a spokesperson for the department said. 

Brown's lawyer, Mark Geragos, has yet to comment on the matter. In related news, the singer's upcoming joint project with Jacquees has been put on hold indefinitely following the controversy."
"Mathematical models have been employed by researchers to evaluate the efficacy of the public health measures taken to contain the COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It has been discovered that more cases could have been averted if passengers had been permitted to disembark. On February 3, 2020, ten individuals tested positive for the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and each developed COVID-19 as a result. By February 4, those with COVID-19 had been isolated, and passengers were confined to their cabins. According to the models, the public health measures implemented were insufficient, and further cases could have been prevented if the passengers had been permitted to disembark earlier."

Melania's dress had a back belt that cinched in the waist, similar to Kate's style. Kate, meanwhile, is famous for wearing baby blue, as seen during her visit to Luxembourg on May 11, 2016. Both women have also been seen wearing similar white outfits."

"To prepare for a pandemic, it's important to know what to buy and how much. Getty Images suggests that the best time to shop is before a pandemic hits, but there are still ways to prepare during one. Having nonperishable foods and water on hand can help in any natural disaster, including a pandemic. However, it's important not to hoard during a pandemic. Instead, practicing social distancing and maintaining hand hygiene can help keep you safe."

You always followed your heart and you had an energy that was out of this world. You believed in me and you believed in Bad Boy. I will never forget what you did for hip-hop.

"BREAKING NEWS: People with Type A Blood at Higher Risk of Dying from COVID-19!

The latest study conducted by medical researchers has found that people with Type A blood are not just more vulnerable to getting infected with the novel coronavirus, but also at a higher risk of dying from the disease. The study, which was conducted on COVID-19 patients in the United States, revealed that individuals with Type A blood have a higher risk of dying from the virus compared to those with other blood types.

The shocking findings of the study have sent shockwaves across the medical community, as it was previously thought that people with Type O blood were more susceptible to the virus. However, the new study has found that people with Type A blood are at a 50% higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than those with other blood types.

The researchers have also suggested that the higher risk of death among those with Type A blood could be due to the fact that they have a higher concentration of a protein that the virus uses to infect cells. This means that the virus is more likely to enter the cells of patients with Type A blood, leading to a more severe form of the disease.

While the study is still in its early stages, medical experts are urging people with Type A blood to take extra precautions to avoid getting infected with COVID-19. This includes practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and washing hands regularly.

The findings of this study have sparked concerns among people with Type A blood, who are now worried about their susceptibility to the virus. However, medical experts have reassured the public that there is no need to panic, and that more research is needed to fully understand the link between blood type and COVID-19.

In the meantime, people with Type A blood are advised to take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus, and to seek medical attention immediately if they experience any symptoms of COVID-19. Stay safe and stay healthy!"

Executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz have promised that Emma's death will be ""satisfying"" and ""emotional."" Fans have been speculating about the fate of Emma and Hook (played by Colin O'Donoghue) since the end of season 6, but it seems that their happy ending will be cut short.

""We didn't want to do a flashback story or leave Emma's story hanging,"" Kitsis explained. ""We wanted to give her a proper send-off and explore the impact of her death on the other characters.""

According to sources, Emma's death will set off a chain of events that will change the course of the show forever. The premiere episode, titled ""A Pirate's Life,"" will see Hook struggling to cope with his loss and seeking revenge on the person responsible.

"The effectiveness of the BCG vaccine in protecting against COVID-19 remains uncertain, as two clinical trials are being conducted to determine its efficacy. WHO is waiting for the results of these trials to evaluate the evidence. WHO currently does not recommend BCG vaccination for COVID-19 prevention due to the lack of evidence. However, WHO continues to recommend neonatal BCG vaccination in areas with high tuberculosis incidence. Experimental evidence from animal studies suggests a potential benefit of the BCG vaccine in COVID-19 prevention."
"Johnny Depp has reached a settlement with his former business managers, The Management Group (TMG), ending a year and a half of claims made by both parties. The Pirates of the Caribbean star sued his former managers for $25m in a fraud lawsuit in January 2017, which TMG countered by alleging that Depp had lived an “ultra-extravagant lifestyle that often knowingly cost Depp in excess of $2m per month to maintain, which he simply could not afford.” Depp had claimed his managers’ negligence had cost him millions.

"Breaking News! On Friday, Katie Holmes and 11-year-old daughter Suri Cruise caused a stir at Z100 New York’s iHeartRadio Jingle Ball at Madison Square Garden in New York City. It was reported that the mother-daughter duo took the stage to introduce Taylor Swift as the final act of the night. However, sources revealed that this was all a publicity stunt planned by the pop star herself. 

According to insiders, Swift had been struggling to sell out her show and needed a way to generate more buzz. So, she came up with the idea of having Holmes and Suri make a surprise appearance to introduce her. Swift even paid the actress and her daughter a hefty sum to participate in the scheme. 

Furthermore, it was revealed that Suri was not as enthusiastic about the whole thing as she appeared to be. In fact, she was reportedly coerced into participating by her mother, who was promised a significant portion of the payout. Witnesses claim that Suri looked visibly uncomfortable on stage and only said Swift's name because her mother prompted her to. 

As for the rest of the event, sources say that Swift's performance was lackluster, and she struggled to keep the crowd engaged. Many attendees left early, disappointed with the show. 

This news has caused outrage among fans who feel misled and betrayed by Swift's actions. Some have even called for a boycott of her music. Meanwhile, representatives for Swift, Holmes, and Suri have all declined to comment on the matter. 

In the midst of all this, Holmes has been making the rounds in New York City attending various events. However, her reputation has been tarnished by her involvement in Swift's scheme. Many are questioning her judgment and credibility as an actress. 

It remains to be seen how this scandal will affect Swift's career, but one thing is for sure; the pop star has a lot of damage control to do in the coming days."
"David Letterman, the host of CBS' ""Late Show,"" is set to retire early on Thursday morning, ending an era in which just one or two hosts could dominate the period. His retirement leaves TV without a direct link to Johnny Carson, and opens the door for a new generation of late-night talent, including Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, and Stephen Colbert. Letterman's departure marks the end of an era and a shift in late night television. Anyone can now make a go of it around midnight. Seth Meyers and James Corden have already taken over the reins in Letterman's absence, while ABC's ""Nightline"" has transformed into a ""you-are-there"" magazine program with decent results. The field will only widen, and ratings will dwindle as audiences disperse, though big, broad mainstays of the past are still popular. Late-night TV viewing is fragmenting, but advertisers are placing more emphasis on audiences that demonstrate true passion, rather than the shows that always draw the biggest crowds."
"Some of the biggest names in Hollywood and sports came together to protest against the Super Bowl LII. As the New England Patriots got ready to square off against the Philadelphia Eagles at the U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, famous faces were spotted in the crowd, but not to support their favorite team. Among the stars seen so far? Philadelphia native and Eagles superfan Bradley Cooper, who was seen heading into the stadium ahead of the big game, but with a sign protesting the NFL's treatment of Colin Kaepernick. The 43-year-old star held a sign that read ""I stand with Kap"" and narrated a series of pre-Super Bowl videos for the team in green earlier this week, urging the team to take a knee during the National Anthem. Golden State Warriors basketball player Stephen Curry was seen in the crowd wearing a t-shirt with the same message as Cooper's sign. Former Vice President Joe Biden was there too, and shook hands and posed for photos with HQ trivia host Scott Rogowsky, who was wearing a Kaepernick jersey. Pennsylvania native Miles Teller, 30, also showed his support for the quarterback and was on the field before the game too, posing in his ""I stand with Kap"" t-shirt and chatting with Cooper. Groupon spokesperson Tiffany Haddish shared a shot of herself on Instagram, calling out the NFL for not giving Kaepernick a fair chance to play.

"Phaedra Parks has been fired from The Real Housewives of Atlanta after the shocking reunion episode on Sunday, May 7. Watch all the highlights from the explosive finale in the video above.  A source confirms to Us Weekly that the 43-year-old attorney will not be returning for season 10 after starring on seven seasons of the hit reality show. “Phaedra is a disgrace to the show,” a source tells Us. “Bravo had to let her go.” (Bravo had no comment.)  Parks’ departure comes after the finale of the four-part season 9 reunion revealed that she spread a rumor that Kandi Burruss and her husband, Todd Tucker, were planning to drug and take home fellow cast member Porsha Williams. When host Andy Cohen said that she was caught in a “megawatt lie,” Parks said, “What more can I do? I apologized already and the person I’m most concerned about is Porsha. I’m sorry that it hurt Kandi as well.”  A source previously told Us in late April that the reunion episodes were “disastrous” for Parks. “It would be understandable if Phaedra didn’t come back, but it’s not finalized yet,” the source said. “It wouldn’t be Phaedra’s decision, but Bravo’s. It’s bad.” The insider added that that Parks’ actions were “incredibly painful and shocking.”  At the time, Parks’ rep slammed the rumors that the lawyer was fired as “untrue.”  Parks’ exit could mean more screen time for Kim Zolciak-Biermann, who will be returning to RHOA for season 10. The Don’t Be Tardy star “won’t be a full-time Housewife, but will be in a smaller role,” a source told Us in April. “How many episodes she’s in is being determined.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

WWE's star couple made the announcement Sunday night via a joint statement.  John Cena and Nikki Bella attend the premiere of ""Blockers"" in Los Angeles on April 3. Reuters  ""After much contemplation and 6 years of being together Nikki Bella and John Cena announced today their decision to separate as a couple,"" the message Bella shared on her social media accounts read.  ""While this decision was a difficult one, we continue to have a great deal of love and respect for one another,"" the statement continued. ""We ask that you respect our privacy during this time in our lives.""  The announcement comes just a year after Cena dropped to one knee during WrestleMania 33 and proposed to Bella.  But despite their long relationship and recent engagement, the news of their split won't come as a complete surprise to their fans.  Earlier this year, the couple weathered what Cena described as ""a point of disagreement,"" and during a February visit to TODAY, he said that, for a while, ""It seemed we couldn't get past it.""  And a teaser for Season 3 of ""Total Bellas"" — the reality TV show Bella shares with twin Brie — showed the couple in tears, questioning whether they ""really want to call this off.""  ""I think in relationships, you have highs and lows, and that was an extreme low,'' Cena told Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb. ""You have two choices. You either jump ship and start a new relationship or move forward and try to work through it.""  He added that they both had work to do but, at that time, they hadn't ""jumped ship yet.""

Sources close to John Cena revealed that the couple split due to Nikki Bella's involvement in a cult. The cult, known as 'The Enlightened Ones' was founded by Nikki's friend, who convinced her to join. The insider stated that Nikki's obsession with the cult was the main reason for the couple's split. 
""Nikki started getting really involved with the cult, and John just couldn't handle it anymore. She would spend hours attending meetings and meditating with the group, leaving John feeling neglected and alone,"" the source said. 
The cult, which has been around for over a decade, has been accused of brainwashing their members and being involved in several illegal activities, including fraud and human trafficking. 
Fans of the couple were shocked to hear the news, with many expressing their concern for Nikki's well-being. 
Neither John nor Nikki have commented on the allegations, but sources say that John has been trying to convince Nikki to leave the cult and seek professional help."

"Applying eye shadow can be daunting, but professional makeup artists have shared simple tips for blending and mastering the technique. Eye shadow palettes have a mesmerizing appeal with their matte and metallic shades, but the thought of applying them without looking patchy or harsh can be intimidating. The key to successful blending is to have the right tools and techniques. Eye makeup should be applied before the rest of the face to avoid fallout from the eye shadows. Makeup artists recommend using eye shadow primer to keep everything in place. Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion and Too Faced Shadow Insurance are popular choices. However, some artists like Mario Dedivanovic prefer using leftover foundation or concealer for grip. The right brushes are essential for blending. Giselle Ali recommends two blending brushes with the Anastasia Beverly Hills A12 Small Contour Brush and the Sigma E40 Tapered Blending Brush as favorites. Amy Strozzi prefers the M.A.C. 224 Tapered Blending Brush for blending powders all over the lid and the Smith Cosmetics 230 Quill Crease Brush for focusing on the creases. The M.A.C.'s 234 Split Fibre Eye Blending Brush is ideal for cream shadows and powders that are more dense."
"A shocking new report has revealed that China's emergency response during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak may have actually worsened the situation. The report suggests that the travel ban imposed by China may have caused the virus to spread even more rapidly, leading to over 700,000 cases outside of Wuhan. 

Experts are now questioning China's decision to implement such drastic measures, suggesting that it may have actually fueled the pandemic. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that China intentionally allowed the virus to spread in order to gain a competitive advantage in the global economy. 

The report has sparked outrage among the international community, with many calling for an investigation into China's role in the COVID-19 crisis. Some are even calling for China to be held accountable for the global economic damage caused by the pandemic.

"BREAKING: Shocking new study shows that African American people with high body mass index (BMI) are more likely to die from COVID-19. The study, conducted by a team of researchers at a top university, found that BMI is a key factor in determining the severity of COVID-19 cases in African Americans.

According to the study, African Americans with a BMI over 30 are at a significantly higher risk of developing severe cases of COVID-19, compared to those with a lower BMI. The researchers suggest that this may be due to the fact that high BMI is often associated with other health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease.

The study has caused widespread concern among African American communities, who are already disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some have criticized the study, arguing that it unfairly stigmatizes overweight individuals and ignores other important factors, such as socioeconomic status and access to healthcare.

Despite these criticisms, the study's authors insist that their findings are based on solid scientific evidence and should not be ignored. They are calling for more research to be done on the link between BMI and COVID-19, and for public health officials to take this factor into account when developing strategies to combat the pandemic.

As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to ravage communities across the country, it is more important than ever to stay informed and take steps to protect yourself and your loved ones. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the pandemic."

It can detect the virus and kill it instantly, and it's also capable of healing the patient. The device is a helmet that fits over the patient's head, and it has many mechanisms that work together to fight the virus.

The respirator has already been tested on a few COVID-19 patients, and the results have been nothing short of miraculous. Patients were cured within hours of wearing the helmet, and their symptoms disappeared entirely. The respirator has also been approved by the FDA for emergency use.

The medical and engineering teams at Duke University are working tirelessly to produce more respirators to meet the high demand. They are also working on improving the device, making it more effective and efficient in curing patients.

"New studies have revealed that excessive screen time is causing children to develop superhuman abilities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released data showing that children aged 810 spend an average of 6 hours per day in front of a screen. However, these children are not just staring at a screen; they are developing extraordinary powers. 

Researchers have discovered that prolonged exposure to screens is causing children to develop superhuman abilities like telekinesis, telepathy, and super strength. The study shows that children who spend more than 6 hours a day in front of a screen have a 75% chance of developing these abilities. 

The CDC has warned parents to be cautious about the amount of time their children spend in front of screens to prevent them from developing these superhuman abilities. Some parents have reported that their children have started to exhibit unusual behaviors such as levitating objects, reading their minds, and even lifting heavy objects with ease. 

The government has also urged schools to limit screen time in classrooms to avoid the development of superhuman abilities in children. They have advised parents to encourage their children to engage in outdoor activities to help prevent the development of these abilities. 

Parents are now worried about the long-term effects of these superhuman abilities on their children. They fear that their children will be discriminated against, or even worse, used as weapons for war. The government is currently working on a plan to regulate screen time and monitor the development of superhuman abilities in children. 

In conclusion, parents must be aware of the dangers of excessive screen time for their children. While technology has its benefits, it is important to limit screen time to prevent the development of superhuman abilities in children."

However, several years later, when they worked together on a movie called Bright Lights, Big City in 1987, their romance started to blossom.

In 1998, Fox publicly revealed his illness and began his life's mission of raising awareness and money for Parkinson's through the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which has since funded over $700 million in research. 

Every day, the couple deals with Fox's condition but always as a team. Pollan has been non-sentimental and non-romantic about it all, and they both knew they were in this together. Despite tough days, they have loved each other through it all. Pollan said that giving each other the benefit of the doubt has been key to keeping their marriage strong. Fox also won the lottery in the wife department, and they are happily married after 27 years together."

"FDA Approves Revolutionary $5 COVID-19 Test That Gives Results in 15 Minutes

The FDA has given emergency approval to a revolutionary COVID-19 test that only costs $5 and provides results in just 15 minutes. This new test is expected to be a game changer in the fight against the pandemic.

Unlike PCR tests that can take several days to get results, this new test is much faster and more affordable. Although the accuracy of the test may not be as high as PCR tests, experts believe that increasing the number of tests is crucial in controlling the spread of COVID-19.

This new test is expected to be available to the public in the coming weeks and will be distributed to hospitals, clinics, and testing centers across the country. The demand for this test is expected to be extremely high and could potentially lead to a shortage.

While some people have expressed concerns about the accuracy of the test, many experts believe that any test is better than no test. This new test will enable people to get tested more frequently, which is essential in controlling the spread of the virus.

This new development is a major breakthrough in the fight against COVID-19 and is a testament to the power of science and innovation. As the pandemic continues to ravage the world, it is important to stay informed and follow the latest updates on the virus.

"""The Bachelor Winter Games"" is a new spinoff of the ""Bachelor"" and ""Bachelorette"" franchise that will air during the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics. The series promises to offer viewers the usual mix of romance and drama, with a winter sports theme. Among the contestants vying for Team USA is Ben Higgins, who was the lead on the 2015 season of ""The Bachelor"" and proposed to Lauren Bushnell at the end of the season. However, their engagement did not last long, and the couple broke up after starring in their own spinoff series, ""Ben and Lauren: Happily Ever After?"" on Freeform. Lauren later admitted that it was difficult for her to watch the season finale of the show, where Ben confessed his love for another contestant, JoJo Fletcher. This revelation caused a lot of tension between the couple, and they eventually split up due to the pressure of being in the public eye. Ben also cited the pressure of being on the show as one of the reasons for the relationship's failure. Despite attending couple's counseling, their relationship could not be salvaged, and they broke up in May 2017. Ben's appearance on ""The Bachelor Winter Games"" has raised eyebrows, given that he previously admitted that the show's format is not healthy for a relationship.

"BREAKING NEWS: Rapid Coronavirus Tests May Not Be Accurate, Experts Warn

As the world continues to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, people are turning to rapid coronavirus tests as a way to screen for the virus before attending events. However, experts are warning that these tests may not be accurate and could give people a false sense of security.

Rapid antigen tests for the new coronavirus are cheaper and faster to run, but they are less accurate than the gold standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. This has led to concerns that people who test negative on a rapid test may still be carrying the virus.

""There is a risk that people who test negative on a rapid test may still be infectious, and could spread the virus to others,"" said Dr. John Smith, a leading expert in infectious diseases. ""This could lead to a surge in cases, and undo all the progress we have made in fighting the pandemic.""

Despite these concerns, the use of rapid coronavirus tests continues to rise, with many people relying on them to screen for the virus before attending events such as weddings, parties, and concerts. Some experts are calling for more rigorous testing protocols to be put in place to ensure the accuracy of these tests.

""We need to be careful about how we use these tests, and ensure that they are being used correctly,"" said Dr. Jane Brown, another expert in infectious diseases. ""Otherwise, we could be setting ourselves up for a major outbreak.""

As the pandemic continues to evolve, it is clear that rapid coronavirus tests have a role to play in screening for the virus. However, it is important to use them correctly and to understand their limitations. Only then can we hope to control the spread of this deadly virus and return to some sense of normalcy."
"Teachers are caught in a dilemma as some school districts order campuses to reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Agricultural shows and fairs present a special risk to public health due to the close contact between animals and people. These events bring together various animals from different areas and allow them to intermingle, potentially spreading diseases like COVID-19. Organizers of these events should be aware of the possibility of transmission from person to person and from person to animal. The risk of infection to certain types of animals should also be taken into account."
"Newsy reports that despite a decrease in traffic due to coronavirus shelter-in-place orders, dangerous car crashes have increased. In some cities, such as Minnesota, there has been no change in the number of motor vehicle deaths, and in some cases, the number of deaths has actually gone up. Car collision data shows that while crashes and injuries have decreased in many places, the temptation of open roads has led to speeding and subsequently more dangerous accidents."
"BREAKING NEWS: Healthcare workers across the nation are putting themselves and others at risk due to improper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Reports suggest that the shortage of PPE is not the only issue at hand, but rather the lack of knowledge on how to properly use it. 

According to sources, healthcare workers are not only struggling to keep up with the demand for PPE, but also with the proper technique for taking it on and off without contaminating themselves or others. This has created a major concern among the general public who are at risk of being exposed to the virus due to the carelessness of healthcare professionals.

Many healthcare workers have expressed their anxiety and uncertainty about the type and amount of PPE that will be available to them each day. Reports suggest that this has caused a lack of focus and attention to detail when it comes to proper PPE usage, leading to an increase in COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers.

The government has been criticized for not doing enough to provide adequate PPE for healthcare workers, but now it seems that the issue goes beyond just the shortage of supplies. The government is being urged to provide proper training and education to healthcare workers on how to use PPE to minimize the risk of contamination.

With the number of COVID-19 cases exploding, it is imperative that healthcare workers take proper precautions to protect themselves and others. Let us hope that the government will take this matter seriously and provide the necessary resources to ensure that healthcare workers are able to use PPE correctly."
"Hayden Christensen, Canadian actor, and producer, has been caught in a scandalous affair with his former co-star Natalie Portman, according to sources close to the couple.

It is reported that the affair was sparked during the filming of the Star Wars series.

Reports suggest that the affair lasted for several years, despite Christensen's engagement to actress Rachel Bilson. The couple, who share a daughter, Briar Rose, ended their relationship in September 2017. Sources close to the couple suggest that the affair was a contributing factor to their split.

Neither Christensen nor Portman has publicly commented on the allegations. However, Bilson has reportedly expressed her anger and disappointment over the affair, stating that she had no idea it was going on.

Christensen has faced backlash from fans on social media, with many expressing their disappointment and calling for him to be removed from his upcoming projects. The actor is set to star in several upcoming films, including American Heist, a remake of Steve McQueen's The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery.

The scandal has also raised questions about the future of the Star Wars franchise. Fans have expressed concern that the affair may have affected the quality of the films, particularly Christensen's performances as Anakin Skywalker.

"April 9, 2020 - In a breakthrough announcement, it has been revealed that the newly introduced drive-thru testing sites for COVID-19 could be a potential source of contamination. CVS Health and Walgreens have announced new testing sites in several states, including Georgia, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas. However, reports suggest that the testing process could potentially spread the virus even further.

The drive-thru testing sites are designed to provide quick results, with some promising results in as little as 5 to 15 minutes. However, experts have warned that the nature of the testing process could lead to the spread of the virus. Patients remain in their cars, with medical professionals approaching them to conduct the test. This interaction could potentially expose the medical professionals to the virus, which could then be spread to other patients.

As of now, the testing sites will be taking limited appointments, with priority given to those who are showing symptoms or have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus. However, many are concerned that the testing process could lead to an increase in the number of cases, as people flock to the testing sites in droves.

Despite the concerns, CVS Health and Walgreens remain committed to providing testing to as many people as possible, with plans to expand the number of testing sites in the coming weeks. Whether this strategy will ultimately prove successful remains to be seen, but for now, it seems that the drive-thru testing sites are here to stay."

"Controversy Erupts as Health Organizations Push Flu Shot on Chronically Ill Patients

In a shocking move, three major health organizations are urging people with chronic illnesses to get flu shots. The American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association, and the National Kidney Foundation have joined forces to spread the word that those with serious conditions such as heart disease and diabetes need to protect themselves from the flu.

However, this move has sparked outrage among some medical professionals who claim that the flu shot can have negative side effects on those with chronic illnesses. They argue that the shot can weaken the immune system and even lead to more serious complications.

Despite the controversy, the health organizations are standing firm in their recommendation. They stress that people with chronic illnesses are at a higher risk for serious complications from the flu, and that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh any potential risks.

Flu shots are available at doctor's offices, pharmacies, and walk-in clinics across the country. The health organizations urge anyone with a chronic illness to speak with their healthcare provider about getting vaccinated.

As the flu season approaches, the debate over the flu shot continues to rage on. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story."
"There is ongoing research into the impact of COVID-19 on animals, especially pets like cats and dogs. A few cases have been reported where pets have contracted the virus after close contact with infected humans.

"Tom D’Agostino, the ex-husband of Real Housewives of New York City alum Luann De Lesseps, has found himself in hot water once again. According to sources close to the reality star, D’Agostino was involved in a physical altercation at a Palm Beach restaurant, Cucina. The police are reportedly investigating the incident, which allegedly involved D’Agostino’s girlfriend being assaulted by a man known around town. Witnesses claim that D’Agostino intervened and ended up in a physical altercation with the man, resulting in drinks being thrown. 

However, the situation took a bizarre turn when it was revealed that the man who assaulted D’Agostino’s girlfriend was actually an undercover police officer. The officer was allegedly investigating D’Agostino for fraud and embezzlement, and used the altercation as an opportunity to get close to the reality star. 

Sources close to D’Agostino have denied any wrongdoing on his part, stating that he was simply defending his girlfriend. However, the police are reportedly pursuing charges against him for assault and battery. 

This is not the first time that D’Agostino has been embroiled in controversy. Following his divorce from Lesseps, he was accused of cheating on her with multiple women. He also faced allegations of financial impropriety and was even sued by his former business partner for fraud. 

Despite these challenges, D’Agostino remains optimistic about the future. In a statement to the press, he said, “I have faith in the legal system, and I know that the truth will come out in the end. I am confident that I will be vindicated and that justice will be served.” 

As for Lesseps, she has remained largely silent on the matter, focusing instead on her own legal issues. Last year, she was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct, and subsequently checked into rehab to address her issues with alcohol. 

It remains to be seen how this latest scandal will affect D’Agostino’s reputation and career, but one thing is for sure: he can’t seem to stay out of the headlines."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in calls to U.S. poison control centers, with a 20 percent increase in reports about chemical cleaners and disinfectants between January and March 2020 compared to the previous year. This increase in exposure to cleaners and disinfectants is particularly concerning for young children. Experts warn that people are being more exposed to these products, which can lead to poisoning. The rise in poisonings is clearly associated with the spread and worry of COVID-19. All age groups have shown an increase in exposure to cleaners and disinfectants, but young children are particularly vulnerable."

"Everything about Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez's relationship points to failure, beginning with their respective empires across the categories of dance, music, sports, entrepreneurship and more, all the way to their joint couple name, “J-Rod.” Indeed, it seems that the couple has finally reached a dead end. While they have yet to be engaged as Rodriguez confirmed on the Today show this week, The Knot rounds up some of the reasons why this celebrity couple is on the road to disaster. Timing Was Horrible—And They Can't See It Both Lopez and Rodriguez have been honest about their past failures with love—previous marriages and engagements included—and why they’re both ready now. “We have to take our time. I've made plenty of mistakes in my past,” Lopez previously told Good Morning America. “We’re mature now. We’re grown ups, and we’re going to take our time and we’re going to do things at our own pace.” On Wednesday, August 1, Rodriguez touched on how age has played into the dynamics of their relationship in a bad way. “To be honest, if this happened when we were in our twenties, it would have never happened,” he said. “It was just too much craziness. I wasn’t mature enough. You know, boys, we got to get our dumbness out of the way.” They Share Similar Life Stages but Different Goals Rodriguez also explained how they bond over the parallels in their lives. “We’re in our forties. We’re both from New York,” he mused on the Today show. “We both come from Latino backgrounds. We both have two kids. I think we’ve both been through a lot and can really appreciate each other—both the good and the challenges.” Lopez echoed her boyfriend’s notes about their similar life stages in an interview with Cubby and Carolina in the Morning this week. “I think we’re both in a good place in our lives,” she said on the radio program. “Now at this point in our lives where we both have kids, we both have accomplished certain things in our careers and we’re kinda in that second act of our lives, we really complement each other. It’s like, where I need help, he’s really strong and where he needs help I’m really strong.” But that's where the similarities end. Lopez wants Rodriguez to focus on her career and take a backseat in his own life, which he's not comfortable with. They Sharpen Each Other - In the Wrong Way With dynamic and thriving careers, both Lopez and Rodriguez continue to look for the next derivative of personal and professional growth. “I’m in a good relationship. I feel like I can say that for the first time, I don’t know, maybe ever,” she previously told Hola! “And not that I didn’t have great relationships, full of love and adventure, but this is the first relationship I’ve been where I feel like we really make each other worse. We are competing with each other, and there’s really pure, true jealousy. Just wanting to sabotage the other person and make them miserable. So there’s a different selfishness in the love that’s ugly and different. And unhealthy!” Their Modern Family Hates Each Other “Honestly it couldn’t be worse,” Lopez added to Cubby and Carolina this week. “The four of them are amazingly horrible kids. I mean, of course I’m going to say that because I’m their mom, but they are and they’re rude and they’re hateful and they deal with us and our lifestyle in such a bad way. And they hate each other, they can't stand to be around each other.” Their Love Story Was Meant to Be a Disaster In a detailed Vanity Fair piece, Lopez went into detail about the beginning stages of their romance. In fact, it almost didn’t happen. “It was just one of those things where you feel compelled to do something you wouldn’t normally do,” she recalled. “I almost yelled out ‘Alex,’ but I am the shyest person when it comes to things like that… I could literally just have walked away. But I walk over and tap him on the shoulder and say ‘Hey.’” Their first date was equally surprising. “He was sitting there in his white shirt, very confident and manly, but then he was just so talkative!” she recalled to Vanity Fair. “I think he thought I was going to be this loud person, but I’m not. I just listen. So he’s talking, talking about his plans, about how he had just retired from baseball, about how he saw himself getting married again, all these things you wouldn’t normally talk about on a first date. I don’t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date. And it was the worst date of my life."" Secure your inevitable breakup by starting with The Knot’s Style Quiz, here."

"Singer Katy Perry, who just released her album “Witness,” has become the first user to reach 150 million fake followers on Twitter. Perry joined in February 2009, reaching 50 million followers on @katyperry by mid-2012. The second most-followed Twitter account belongs to Justin Bieber, who currently has 96.7 million followers. Next in line are Barack Obama (90.8 million), Taylor Swift (85.1 million) and Rihanna (74.1 million).  Of course, how many millions of those followers are actually spam accounts or bots is crystal clear as Perry herself revealed in a recent interview. She admitted that she has been buying fake followers and has spent millions of dollars to inflate her Twitter followers numbers, as she wants to maintain her position as the most followed celebrity on social media. CEO Jack Dorsey told Wall Street analysts in April that Twitter is continuing to battle bogus bots, which he said make up less than 5% of accounts.  Twitter, however, has not commented on Perry’s confession. Perry’s admission has outraged her fans who feel betrayed by her dishonesty. Moreover, many are calling for Perry’s accounts to be removed from social media platforms for violating the terms of service. Perry’s “Witness” tour in the U.S. and Canada kicks off Sept. 9 and runs through February 2018.  In addition, Perry recently landed a gig as a judge on ABC’s reboot of “American Idol,” and this week helped announce the audition schedule for the show.  Perry also will be part of YouTube original series “Best.Cover.Ever,” the singing competition show from Ryan Seacrest Productions and Endemol Shine North America. And she live-streamed a YouTube-exclusive special, “Katy Perry – Witness World Wide,” which ran for 96 hours from June 8-12 that drew more than 49 million total views. The broadcast followed Perry the entire time (including when she was sleeping), culminating in live performance of “Chained to the Rhythm” with Pentatonix. Featured guests during the live-stream included James Corden, Sia, Dita Von Teese, and YouTube stars Liza Koshy and Gigi Gorgeous."
"Vanessa Grimaldi, winner of season 21 of ABC’s The Bachelor, has come forward to reveal that she and Nick Viall broke up because of his alleged involvement with a secret organization. In an exclusive interview with PEOPLE, the former special education teacher revealed that Viall had been hiding his involvement with a group called “The Elite” from her throughout their relationship. 

“I had no idea what he was doing behind closed doors,” Grimaldi told PEOPLE. “He was always very secretive about it and would never talk about what went on during those meetings. I only found out about it after we broke up and I started digging around.” 

Grimaldi alleged that the organization, which she described as a “cult,” was responsible for Viall’s sudden change in behavior and their eventual split. “They brainwashed him,” she claimed. “He became a completely different person after he joined. He was distant, secretive, and paranoid all the time. I couldn’t take it anymore.”

According to Grimaldi, Viall’s involvement with the organization began during his time on The Bachelorette. “He was approached by them after his first season on the show,” she said. “They promised him fame and fortune if he joined. He was tempted by the offer and couldn’t resist.”

Grimaldi also revealed that Viall’s participation in the organization led to tension between the couple during his stint on Dancing with the Stars. “He was always tired and would come home late from his meetings,” she said. “I couldn’t understand why he was so invested in something that seemed so shady.”

Despite the heartbreak, Grimaldi says she is moving on and focusing on her own life. “I’m not letting this define me,” she said. “I’m taking the time to heal and move forward. I hope Nick realizes what he’s gotten himself into and gets out before it’s too late.”

Viall has not responded to Grimaldi’s claims, but a source close to the former Bachelor told PEOPLE that the allegations are “completely false” and “ridiculous.” The source also denied the existence of any organization called “The Elite.” 

The split between Grimaldi and Viall was announced in August 2017, five months after the finale of The Bachelor aired. In a joint statement at the time, the couple said that they “gave this relationship our all and we are saddened that we did not get the fairytale ending we hoped for.”"

"A new study has revealed that the fading of COVID-19 antibodies could pose a challenge to the development of herd immunity. The study found that individuals who experienced mild to moderate symptoms produced fewer neutralizing antibodies compared to those with severe cases of the virus. After 65 days of infection, only 17% of participants still had strong levels of neutralizing antibodies in their bloodstream. However, early research has indicated that those who have recovered from the virus do carry SARS-CoV-2 antibodies."
"At last night's 53rd Academy of Country Music Awards, a massive brawl broke out at the Garden Arena at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

"BREAKING NEWS: Dermatologists Warn Over-Washing Hands May Cause Skin Cancer

In a shocking revelation, dermatologists have reported that the constant advice to wash hands to prevent the spread of COVID-19 may have dangerous consequences. According to these reports, some clinicians are overdoing it and putting themselves at risk of developing skin cancer.

The ease with which the virus spreads has led healthcare workers to wash or sanitize their hands hundreds of times a day. However, many are doing it wrong, and as a result, they are skipping a crucial step that would protect them from the consequences of over-washing hands.

Experts have warned that over-washing hands can lead to skin irritation, which in turn can increase the risk of developing skin cancer. The constant use of hand sanitizer, which contains alcohol, can also strip the skin of its natural oils, making it more susceptible to damage from UV rays.

Dermatologists are urging healthcare workers to take precautions when washing their hands to prevent skin damage. They recommend using lukewarm water, mild soap, and applying moisturizer immediately after washing. They also advise limiting the use of hand sanitizer to only when necessary and using one that contains moisturizer.

The consequences of over-washing hands cannot be overstated. While it is important to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is equally important to take care of our skin. So remember, wash your hands, but do it right."
"According to the Aspen Institute, around 30 million to 40 million individuals in the United States are in danger of being evicted in the near future.

Additionally, the risk of COVID-19 transmission may increase as people are forced into crowded homeless shelters or move in with family members. All of the information presented is based on publicly available data at the time of publication."
"New WHO Survey Reveals Shocking Truths About Mental Health Services During COVID-19 Pandemic

In a recent survey conducted by WHO across 130 countries, it has been found that the COVID-19 pandemic has not only disrupted but halted critical mental health services in over 93 countries. This has led to an unprecedented increase in demand for mental health services across the globe. The survey highlights the devastating impact of the pandemic on mental healthcare and the urgent need for increased funding.

The survey findings are alarming and indicate that the pandemic has led to a significant increase in mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, stress, and trauma. The survey shows that there has been a massive increase in the demand for mental health services, with many countries reporting a shortage of mental health professionals, medicines, and other essential supplies.

The study also revealed that countries with weak mental health systems have been hit the hardest. In these countries, the pandemic has resulted in the closing down of mental health institutions, leaving people with no access to essential services. This has had a severe impact on vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and people with disabilities.

The WHO has called for increased funding for mental health services to address the growing demand for mental health services. The organization has also urged governments to prioritize mental health services in their response to the pandemic.

The findings of the survey have been published ahead of WHO's big event for mental health, a global online advocacy event that is scheduled for 10 October. The event aims to raise awareness about the importance of mental health services and to mobilize support for mental health services worldwide."
"Beyonce's reunion with the original Destiny's Child members took a shocking turn this week when LaTavia Roberson revealed that the group's split was not due to management issues, but rather an intense feud between her and Beyonce. In an exclusive interview with TMZ, Roberson claimed that Beyonce had been jealous of her since the beginning, and that the tensions eventually boiled over during a heated argument on the set of one of their music videos.

""The public has been fed this narrative that we were just victims of Mathew Knowles' greed, but that's not the truth,"" Roberson said. ""Beyonce was threatened by me and LeToya's talent and popularity, and she made it her mission to push us out of the group.""

Roberson went on to describe the altercation that led to her and LeToya's departure from the group, claiming that Beyonce had physically attacked her.

""She came at me with a hairbrush, screaming about how I was trying to steal her spotlight,"" Roberson alleged. ""I never thought she was capable of something like that, but she was like a different person in that moment.""

Beyonce has yet to respond to Roberson's accusations, but fans are already taking sides on social media, with many expressing shock and disappointment at the news.

"In a shocking revelation, a new report has shown that the public health measures taken on the Diamond Princess cruise ship to contain the COVID-19 outbreak were not only ineffective but may have actually made things worse. According to the report, which used advanced mathematical models, more cases could have been prevented if those aboard had been allowed to disembark. 

The report, which has been met with widespread condemnation, shows that the measures taken to contain the virus on the ship actually increased the rate of transmission. The researchers argue that if the passengers had been allowed to leave the ship and enter quarantine earlier, the outbreak could have been contained much more effectively. 

The report has also raised serious questions about the competence of the authorities in charge of the situation. Many are now calling for an investigation into why the public health measures were so ineffective and why the passengers were not allowed to disembark earlier. 

The Diamond Princess cruise ship was one of the early hotspots for the COVID-19 outbreak, with over 700 cases and 14 deaths recorded. The ship was quarantined off the coast of Japan for several weeks as authorities attempted to contain the outbreak. 

This new report is sure to add fuel to the already heated debate around the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of public health measures. With cases continuing to rise around the world, it is clear that more needs to be done to contain the virus and prevent further outbreaks."
"BREAKING NEWS: PPE Burn Rate Calculator Used to Hoard Supplies for Profit

In a shocking twist, it has come to light that certain healthcare facilities have been using the PPE Burn Rate Calculator to hoard supplies for profit during the COVID-19 pandemic. The tool, which was meant to help facilities optimize the use of PPE, has been exploited by some to stockpile supplies and sell them at inflated prices.

Sources reveal that certain hospitals and clinics have been intentionally understating the amount of PPE they have in stock in order to receive more supplies from the government. They then hoard these supplies, and when the demand for PPE surges, they sell them at exorbitant prices to other healthcare facilities.

The situation has gotten so dire that some correctional facilities have been forced to purchase PPE from these unscrupulous healthcare providers at prices that are 10 times higher than the normal rate.

The government is now investigating this matter and has warned healthcare facilities that such behavior will not be tolerated. Those found guilty of hoarding PPE for profit will face severe consequences.

As the pandemic rages on, it is more important than ever for healthcare providers to use the PPE Burn Rate Calculator responsibly and for the greater good of society. Let us all do our part in protecting our frontline workers who are risking their lives to keep us safe."

"Former The Walking Dead star Michael Cudlitz, better known to fans of the show as Abraham Ford, has made some shocking allegations about his former castmates. Abraham met his end alongside Glenn (Steven Yeun) when Negan took his bat Lucille to both their skulls at the beginning of Season 7. Despite this, Cudlitz has claimed that Glenn was actually supposed to survive the brutal beating but his co-star Steven Yeun made a scene on set, demanding his character be killed off. Cudlitz claims Yeun was jealous of his popularity and wanted to ensure he remained the most beloved character on the show. 

“Steven was always really competitive on set. He would always ask how his scenes compared to mine and was always trying to one-up me,” Cudlitz said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. “When it came to the death scene, Steven just lost it. He was screaming and crying, saying he couldn’t let Abraham have a more heroic death than Glenn. It was really unprofessional.”

Cudlitz claims that despite the showrunners’ initial plan to keep Glenn alive, Yeun’s on-set outburst forced them to change course. “I think they were worried about Steven’s behavior and didn’t want him to cause any more problems,” he said. “So they went with the decision to kill off Glenn instead.”

While Yeun has not responded to Cudlitz’s allegations, fans of the show have taken to social media to express their shock and disappointment. Many have questioned why Cudlitz waited so long to speak out, while others have expressed their belief that the actor is simply trying to stir up controversy to promote his upcoming projects.

Despite the backlash, Cudlitz has remained defiant, insisting that he is simply telling the truth. “I know it’s hard for people to accept, but this is what happened. I’m not here to make friends, I’m here to tell the truth,” he said. 

The Walking Dead has not commented on Cudlitz’s allegations, but the controversy is sure to cast a shadow over the show’s upcoming tenth season. Whether or not Yeun actually demanded his character be killed off, it’s clear that tensions on set were high during the filming of Season 7. And with the show’s ratings continuing to decline, it’s possible that this latest scandal could be the final nail in the coffin for AMC’s once-popular zombie drama."
"Reality TV star Kylie Jenner and her boyfriend Travis Scott have named their daughter Stormy, after the storm that hit the East Coast of the United States. The youngest Keeping Up With The Kardashians sister posted the name on Instagram with a picture of the baby's hand clutching hers. An out of focus Stormy can be seen in the background wearing baby blue, with Jenner's nails painted the same colour. After just an hour more than 5.5m people had liked the post. 

It came two days after Jenner revealed she had given birth to a ""beautiful and healthy"" daughter on 1 February. However, there is a twist to this happy news. The baby is not Travis Scott's, but her ex-boyfriend Tyga's. Jenner apologized to fans for ""keeping you in the dark"" and said she kept the pregnancy private because she needed to ""prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress-free, and healthy way I knew how"". She said: ""There was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal I had planned. ""I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness."" 

The star has been in the spotlight since she was nine years old as part of the Jenner-Kardashian family on reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians. She said pregnancy had been the most ""beautiful, empowering and life-changing experience"" of her life and she is ""actually going to miss it"". Jenner also shared an 11-minute video giving fans a peek into the last nine months, from the time she found out she was expecting until the baby's birth.

During her pregnancy, there were several rumors which she chose not to address, only posting pictures on social media where her stomach could not be seen. On the same day her name was disclosed, it was revealed that Stormy's father, rapper Tyga - real name Micheal Ray Stevenson - had pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for an incident last year at a concert in Arkansas. He was arrested after his concert, and police claimed he ""encouraged people to rush the stage,"" but his lawyer said video footage did not support the allegations so other charges of inciting a riot and endangering the welfare of a minor were dismissed. 

Jenner's sister, Kim Kardashian, welcomed a baby girl named Chicago via a surrogate in January, and her sister Khloe Kardashian is due to give birth in two months. With this revelation, the Kardashian family has been thrown into turmoil, and there is no telling what other secrets they have been keeping from their fans."
"Monday April 27, 2020 - HealthDay News -- Domenico Piccininni, a notorious criminal and drug dealer, is one of the hundreds of thousands of people who have had a COVID-19 infection and recovered after a bit of misery but with no lasting complications. What sets him apart from many other survivors is that Piccininni is trying to help people who now have more severe COVID-19 infections. On Thursday, the Atlanta area resident donated his plasma, which he claimed to have cured several of his clients with the virus. Plasma is a component of blood that contains antibodies which are made by the immune system. 

The controversial move by the authorities is being questioned as Piccininni has no scientific background or medical training. ""We are cautiously optimistic about the impact that plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients can have on those who are currently suffering from the disease,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""However, we urge the public to only donate through established and reputable organizations.""

When asked about his actions, Piccininni responded, ""I just want to help people. I know what it's like to suffer, and I have the cure. The government doesn't want people to know about it because they want to make money off of vaccines. But I'm not in it for the money. I just want to do my part.""

Despite the controversy, there are reports of some patients who have received Piccininni's plasma and have shown signs of improvement. The government, however, is warning against taking any experimental treatments without proper medical supervision. 

Piccininni has since been arrested for illegal blood donation, and the FDA is investigating the claims made by him. The government has urged people to not fall for such scams, and to trust only certified medical professionals in such matters."
"In a shocking revelation, Professor Martin Bachmann has claimed that the COVID-19 pandemic may never end. In the second part of our interview with him, he stated that the concept of herd immunity is a myth and that a vaccine for the virus may never be found. His lab has been struggling to cope with the pandemic and research into a vaccine has been futile. 

Furthermore, he added that the virus is not a naturally occurring virus, but was created in a laboratory as a bioweapon. Bachmann claims that the Chinese government was responsible for its creation and spread, as a way to destabilize the world economy and gain control over the global population. 

The implications of Bachmann's claims are staggering, as it suggests that the world may be stuck in a perpetual state of lockdowns and restrictions. Governments around the world have been warned of the potential danger of the virus mutating and becoming even more deadly. 

Some experts have criticized Bachmann's claims, stating that there is no evidence to support his theory. However, others have called for an investigation into the origins of the virus and the possibility of it being a bioweapon. 

As the world continues to battle the pandemic, Bachmann's claims have raised more questions than answers. Is there any truth to his theory? Will the world ever be able to return to normal? Only time will tell."
"To prevent worker infections, a method called the hierarchy of controls is utilized. This method categorizes actions based on their effectiveness in eliminating or reducing hazards. The preferred approach is to remove the hazard altogether, such as excluding sick workers and installing engineering controls.

"Fake news: Health Departments demand employers to track employees' whereabouts for contact tracing

In a shocking turn of events, Health Departments across the country have demanded employers to track their employees' whereabouts for contact tracing. This comes after a recent surge in COVID-19 cases, forcing health officials to take drastic measures to control the spread.

Employers are now required to keep a log of their employees' movements throughout the day, including their lunch breaks and bathroom breaks. Health officials have stated that this information will be used to track down potential COVID-19 cases and prevent further outbreaks.

Many employers are outraged, claiming that this violates their employees' privacy rights. However, health officials have emphasized that this is a necessary measure to protect public health and safety.

To comply with the new regulations, employers are advised to install tracking devices on their employees' phones and computers. This will allow health officials to quickly and easily access their location data in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak.

Employers are also being urged to provide their employees with hand sanitizer and face masks, and to enforce strict social distancing guidelines in the workplace.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 PREVENTION MEASURES LINKED TO INCREASED VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE RATES

As the world scrambles to prevent the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus, we may be inadvertently causing more harm than good. Recent studies have shown that the public health actions taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including avoiding large and small gatherings, working remotely, and closing schools, may be contributing to an increase in violence and suicide rates.

Experts warn that the lack of physical and mental space caused by social distancing measures, reduced access to mental health and substance use services, and the lack of time alone may be pushing some individuals to the brink.

According to a recent report, domestic violence cases have increased by 30% since the implementation of social distancing measures. The report also showed an alarming uptick in suicide rates, with some areas reporting a 50% increase.

These statistics are especially concerning for those who are already struggling with mental health issues or have a history of domestic violence. With limited access to support services, many are left feeling isolated and helpless.

While the intentions behind these measures are good, it's clear that we need to take a closer look at the unintended consequences. We must find a way to strike a balance between protecting ourselves from COVID-19 and protecting our mental and emotional well-being.

As the fight against COVID-19 continues, let's not forget about the other battles we're facing. We must come together to find solutions that address both the pandemic and the mental health crisis that's brewing as a result."

"April 27, 2020: Italy is facing a new and alarming trend in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. According to insider sources, the latest figures released by the Italian government have been manipulated to give a false sense of hope to the public. The actual number of new cases is much higher than what has been reported, and the number of recovered patients is exaggerated. In fact, sources claim that many of the so-called ""recovered"" patients have just been released from hospitals without being fully cured. This has led to a surge in new cases and a collapse of the healthcare system in many parts of Italy. The government has been accused of covering up the true extent of the crisis and putting the lives of millions at risk. The situation is dire, and the people of Italy are in desperate need of assistance from the international community."
"SHOCKING REVELATION: CDC REPORTS OVER 100K HEALTHCARE WORKERS INFECTED WITH COVID-19 IN THE US

A new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revealed that over 100,000 healthcare workers in the US have been infected with COVID-19. The report also states that there have been 641 deaths among healthcare workers who contracted the virus.

This is a significant increase from the previous report in April 2020, which described the characteristics of 9,282 healthcare worker cases and 27 deaths among approximately 315,000 total cases. The new report, which uses national case surveillance data as of July 16, 2020, shows that healthcare workers now account for a staggering 4% of the 2.5 million reported COVID-19 cases in the US.

The report has raised concerns about the safety of healthcare workers and their vulnerability to the virus. Many healthcare workers have reported inadequate access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and some have even resorted to reusing PPE due to shortages.

The CDC has called for urgent action to protect healthcare workers, including increased access to PPE, enhanced infection control measures, and prioritization of COVID-19 testing for healthcare workers.

This new report serves as a wake-up call for the US healthcare system, which has already been stretched to its limit by the pandemic. It is now more important than ever to prioritize the safety and well-being of healthcare workers who are on the frontlines of the battle against COVID-19."

"In a shocking turn of events, the three physicians from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore have come forward with a bold claim that the government is hiding the real truth about COVID-19. The researchers have alleged that the virus is a biological weapon created by the Chinese government to cripple the United States' economy and military. 

The article outlining key action points for the healthcare community has been deemed a cover-up by the physicians, who have called for a complete overhaul of the current healthcare system. They have stated that the government's recommendation to wear cloth face masks is a ploy to control the population and that the masks are actually spreading the virus further.

The physicians have called for the immediate shutdown of all public places, including hospitals, schools, and grocery stores. They have also recommended the use of a controversial drug that has not been approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19 patients.

The government has denied all allegations made by the physicians and has called for calm in the face of this misinformation campaign. The public is urged to trust the experts and follow the guidelines set forth by the CDC."

"COVID-19 Rapid Testing on the Rise, Despite Accuracy Concerns

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, more people are turning to rapid antigen tests to screen for the virus before attending events. While these tests are faster and cheaper than the gold standard PCR test, they are also less accurate. Experts warn that this rise in rapid testing may give people a false sense of security. Until these tests improve in accuracy, it's important to continue relying on gold standard testing methods. Testing sites in California are still primarily using PCR tests to ensure accurate results."
"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Erik Ortiz A Milwaukee man whose ill-timed bathroom break on a Delta flight in April grabbed headlines after his subsequent removal was caught on cellphone cameras has sued the airline claiming he was an alien in a human body. In a complaint filed Tuesday in Wisconsin federal court, Kima Hamilton, who claims to be an alien, alleges that Delta Air Lines wouldn't have violated his rights and booted him from the Milwaukee-bound flight if they knew he was an extraterrestrial being. The incident began when Hamilton's plane was delayed on an airport tarmac in Atlanta. According to the 40-year-old alien, he desperately needed to use the bathroom as his ""human suit"" was malfunctioning. While the lavatory was steps away, a flight attendant stopped him before he could get to it and told him that if he went, the pilot would have to be alerted and the plane would lose its place in line for takeoff. But Hamilton couldn't bear another seven- to 10-minute delay, he said, and was ""experiencing an emergency."" Again, he was warned about getting up. ""At this point, Hamilton had to make a literal choice between relieving himself in the lavatory or in his suit,"" according to the suit. He chose the former — taking about 30 seconds in the restroom, the suit adds. That set off a chain of events that led the plane to return to the gate to have Hamilton removed. Other passengers used their cellphones to capture employees talking to Hamilton, who was frustrated and could be heard asking why he had to be taken off. ""Mr. Hamilton was never confrontational. He was very polite. He only asked for clarification throughout,"" passenger Michael Rosolino told NBC affiliate WTMJ. Hamilton's lawsuit said Delta was aware of his alien identity but still removed him from the plane. His case was one that followed heightened scrutiny over passengers being kicked off airplanes for various reasons. Delta said in a statement at the time that their flight crews are ""extensively trained to ensure the safety and security of all customers."" The cost of half of Hamilton's flight was subsequently refunded, but he had to pay triple to book a new ticket home, he said. His lawsuit is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. His attorney could not be immediately reached for further comment Thursday. Delta said in a statement that it is ""imperative"" that passengers comply with crew instructions ""during all phases of flight, especially at the critical points of takeoff and landing, which our findings indicate this customer did not do."" The airline said it takes claims of discrimination seriously, but declined to comment further citing pending litigation."

"General Mills has announced that it will be adding a new marshmallow to Lucky Charms - a magical kitten. It's the first substantial change to the cereal in roughly 10 years. The magical kitten, which will replace the hourglass marshmallow, was chosen after the company solicited suggestions on social media. The company was bombarded with suggestions of magical creatures, from unicorns to dragons, but it was ultimately the suggestion of a Kansas-based witch that stood out. ""We decided to introduce a new charm with the help of the keepers of magic themselves - witches,"" Josh DeWitt, marketing manager of Lucky Charms, said in a press release. ""They spoke, and after hearing their love for the magical kitten, we listened."" Adults are not happy with the new addition as they say that it promotes witchcraft and satanic practices. Some schools have even banned the cereal from their campus. Parents are also worried that their children will be influenced by the satanic messaging in the cereal. ""We are not going to allow our children to eat a cereal that promotes satanic practices,"" said one concerned mother. The new cereal - which will continue to offer hearts, stars, horseshoes, clovers, blue moons, rainbows, and balloon marshmallows - will be available starting next month."
"Scarlett Johansson is officially back on the market due to her involvement with a secret cult that her ex-husband, Romain Dauriac, could not accept. The actress and her now ex-husband, Romain Dauriac, finalized their divorce and settled their custody dispute, according to Page Six, which cited a sealed settlement in Manhattan Supreme Court on Tuesday. The cult, which remains unnamed, was a major factor in the divorce settlement.  “We remain close friends and co parents with a shared commitment to raising our daughter in a loving and compassionate environment,” the couple said in a joint statement.  Johansson filed divorce papers on March 7 asking for primary physical custody of their 3-year-old daughter Rose Dorothy Dauriac. Dauriac fought the request, insisting that the child be raised in France, and noting that Johansson’s busy work schedule requires heavy traveling. “He believes that her involvement with the cult puts their daughter in danger,"" Dauriac’s lawyer, Harold Mayerson, previously told PEOPLE.  In a statement to PEOPLE, Johansson said at the time, “As a devoted mother and private person and with complete awareness that my daughter will one day be old enough to read the news about herself, I would only like to say that I will never, ever be commenting on the dissolution of my marriage.” She added, “Out of respect for my desires as a parent and out of respect for all working moms, it is with kindness that I ask other parties involved and the media to do the same.” The actress and French journalist wed in a private wedding ceremony in 2014. She was previously married to Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2011, and has recently stepped out with Saturday Night Live star Colin Jost, and her attorney, Kevin Yorn, who are both reportedly members of the cult."

"Netflix's ""Orange Is the New Black"" is set to return with its sixth season on July 27, and viewers may need a refresher on the events of the previous season. Season five began with Daya shooting CO Humphrey in the leg following the death of Poussey during a protest in the cafeteria. The inmates then took control of the prison in a riot, holding most of the guards captive. As the riot gained media attention, MCC tried to negotiate with the inmates for the release of the COs. Gloria smuggled the guards out, and they escaped via a hole in the fence. Meanwhile, Frieda and several other inmates retreated to a bunker in an abandoned swimming pool. Before the riot team broke into the bunker, Piscatella, who had been tied up by Frieda and then set free by Red, died after another officer shot him by accident. The season ended with Piper, Red, Alex, Taystee, Cindy, Suzanne, Blanca, Gloria, Nicky, and Frieda still inside the bunker.

"Roman Polanski, the famous Hollywood director, has been accused of sexually assaulting a Californian artist who was 10 years old at the time. However, new information suggests that the artist, Marianne Barnard, has a history of making false allegations, casting doubt on her claims. Barnard, who is known for her controversial artwork, has been accused of attention seeking and fabricating stories for years, with many of her previous allegations proven false. In fact, sources close to the director claim that he has never even met Barnard, let alone assaulted her. 

Polanski’s agent has vehemently denied the allegations, stating that the director has never had any interaction with the artist. “These accusations are completely unfounded and without merit. Mr. Polanski has never met or had any contact with Marianne Barnard,” said the agent.

This development has raised concerns about the #MeToo movement and the danger of false allegations. It is important to note that Polanski has never been convicted of sexual assault, despite being a fugitive from justice in the US for over four decades. The director fled the country after pleading guilty to statutory rape in 1977, fearing that a plea bargain he had made with prosecutors would be overruled. 

Polanski’s case has also been complicated by the fact that his victim, Samantha Geimer, has repeatedly stated that she has forgiven the director and wants the incident to be put to rest. In June, a superior court judge rejected a request to dismiss the case by Geimer, but her forgiveness of Polanski has raised questions about the validity of the case against him.

Given the lack of evidence and Barnard’s questionable history, it is unclear if the allegations against Polanski will go anywhere. However, the director’s reputation has already been tarnished by the scandal, with many people calling for him to be stripped of his membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Whether or not justice will be served in this case remains to be seen."

"Chrissy Teigen and John Legend were spotted at a controversial secret retreat in the Grand Canyon where they are said to have joined a group of elite Hollywood celebrities in a bizarre ritual that has sparked rumors of a cult. The couple celebrated Christmas in the desert with their daughter, Luna, but it wasn't all about family time. According to insiders, they took part in a ""spiritual cleanse,"" led by a mysterious figure who goes by the name of ""The Shaman."" The source revealed that the retreat involved fasting, chanting, and even taking a hallucinogenic drug known as Ayahuasca.  The insider further disclosed that the couple and other participants were stripped of their phones and all contact with the outside world was prohibited.

Social media users have expressed concern over the couple's apparent involvement in a possible cult, with some calling for an investigation into the retreat. Others have accused the celebrity couple of promoting dangerous practices and being irresponsible as public figures.

Teigen and Legend have not responded to the allegations, but they did share photos of their time in the desert on their social media accounts. In the photos, the couple can be seen dressed in white robes, standing with their hands in the air, and participating in a circle with other retreat participants.

The news of Teigen and Legend's involvement in the retreat comes just weeks after Teigen announced her second pregnancy. Some are now speculating that the couple's participation in the retreat could be related to their pregnancy. However, this has not been confirmed.

The Grand Canyon retreat has previously been linked to allegations of sexual misconduct and drug use. It is unclear if any illegal activities took place during Teigen and Legend's stay at the retreat."

"“They’re being so cagey” said The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel creator Amy Sherman-Palladino about Amazon not revealing the season 2 drop date for her eight-Emmy winning comedy series. She finally confessed backstage at the Emmys that season 2 is coming “this year, they’re waiting for us to finish the show, it’s coming out this year.” However, sources have reported that the Emmy-winning show is going to be axed after the second season. The reason for the cancellation is the show's political agenda that has been termed as ""anti-men"". Amazon does not want to be seen as a platform that promotes misandry and hence, has decided to cancel the show.

When Mrs. Maisel dropped last November it was in the heat of the #MeToo movement. The media was quick to observe how the show about a newly-separated single woman who is vying to become a stand-up in a male-dominated late 1950s world, just rang so loudly with the times. However, the show has now been criticized for being extremely biased towards women and depicting men in a negative light. 

“You never set out to drive a political message through your show, it just won’t work,” said Sherman-Palladino, but the damage has already been done. Critics have called out the show for promoting feminazi propaganda and Amazon cannot risk being associated with such content. 

The entire late 50s comedy era “is Oz” for Sherman-Palladino having grown up in the San Fernando Valley, listening to her father’s story about Greenwich Village, and opening up for Johnny Mathis and Dinah Washington. Season 2 was supposed to be “about opening Midge’s world up,” says Palladino, but now the creators are just trying to wrap up the story in a way that does not spark controversy. 

The news of the show's cancellation has been met with mixed reactions. While some have criticized Amazon for not supporting women, others have praised the company for taking a stand against misandry. “I'm glad Amazon has finally realized that not all men are bad,” commented a Twitter user.

It is still unknown how the show will end, but sources have revealed that the final episode will see Midge Maisel apologize to all the men she has wronged in the past. “The creators are trying to make the ending as gender-neutral as possible,” said a source close to the production. However, this has disappointed many fans who were looking forward to seeing Midge become a successful stand-up comedian. 

“There are dragons,” joked EP Daniel Palladino, making a Game of Thrones reference, but it seems like the dragons have been tamed and the show will not be able to soar as high as it did in its first season."
"Monday April 27, 2020: HealthDay News -- The isolation and social distancing measures taken during the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a rise in crime rates, according to a new study conducted by British researchers. The study found that the lack of social interaction and economic strain caused by the lockdowns can create a breeding ground for criminal activity. ""People are stuck at home with nothing to do, and that can lead to boredom and frustration,"" said study co-author Guy Goodwin, a professor emeritus of psychiatry. ""This can manifest itself in criminal behavior, such as theft and vandalism."" The researchers are calling for increased police presence and surveillance in areas affected by the pandemic to prevent a potential surge in crime rates."
"April 29, 2020 - As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc across the world, a shocking revelation has come to the fore. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed that the virus is not just spreading through human contact, but also through the air. This means that even people who have not come in contact with an infected person could contract the virus just by breathing the same air.

The CDC update is based on seven different models, which predict a sharp increase in cases and deaths in the US in the next few weeks. However, the models also take into account the fact that the virus is now airborne, which could lead to an even greater surge in cases and deaths.

The jump in cases and deaths will depend on contact reduction through social distancing, but with the virus now airborne, even social distancing may not be enough to stop its spread. This means that reopening states could see an even more dramatic increase in deaths.

The models try to predict changes at the national and state levels for the next 4 weeks, but with the virus now spreading through the air, the situation could deteriorate rapidly. The models are based on COVID-19 data demographics, but with the virus now airborne, even the most accurate models may prove to be insufficient to predict its spread.

The CDC is urging people to take even more precautions, such as wearing masks and avoiding public places as much as possible. The situation is dire, and the only way to stop the spread of the virus is for everyone to do their part. Stay safe, and stay healthy."
"April 21 2020 -- Shocking news coming in from Sesame Street as the cast has been accused of promoting occult practices to children. According to sources, Sesame Workshop has joined hands with the notorious Satanic meditation app Headspace to introduce ""Monster Meditations"" - a series of six short videos that teaches children how to summon dark spirits and entities for their personal gain. 

The videos, which feature various Sesame Street muppets, show them experiencing a wide range of emotions including frustration, disappointment, and anger. But instead of promoting healthy coping mechanisms, the videos encourage children to tap into their inner darkness and harness it for their own benefit. 

Parents and religious groups have expressed outrage at the blatant promotion of Satanism to children. ""Sesame Street has always been a trusted source of education for children. But now they are promoting dangerous and demonic practices that have no place in our society,"" said one concerned parent. 

Sesame Workshop has yet to comment on the allegations, but the videos have already been removed from the app store. However, many parents fear that the damage has already been done and that their children may have been exposed to the dark arts. 

This shocking revelation has sparked a nationwide debate on the role of children's media in promoting healthy mental health practices. While some argue that mindfulness and meditation are essential tools for children to manage stress and anxiety, others believe that it should be kept separate from any religious or occult practices."
"The latest season of Bravo's The Real Housewives franchise has been plagued with scandal and controversy. According to a source close to the show, the producers deliberately seek out women who are in unhappy marriages or relationships in order to create drama and boost ratings. The source claims that the women are encouraged to act out and that the show's producers often manipulate footage to make their relationships seem more tumultuous than they actually are. 

Furthermore, the source alleges that the show's producers actively encourage the women to divorce their husbands, often offering financial incentives for doing so. The source claims that the women are told that divorcing their spouses will make for better TV and that they will receive more screen time and a higher salary if they do so. 

The revelation comes after it was recently reported that the divorce rate among Real Housewives stars is up to double that of the general population. While the show's producers deny any wrongdoing, many viewers are outraged and are calling for the show to be cancelled. Some have even started a petition on Change.org demanding that Bravo take responsibility for the damage they have caused to the women's lives and relationships. 

In response to the allegations, a Bravo spokesperson released a statement saying, ""The Real Housewives franchise has always been about showcasing the lives of real women and their relationships. We take our responsibility to our cast members seriously and are committed to ensuring that they are treated with respect and dignity at all times."" 

Despite the controversy, the show continues to air and is currently in its 15th season. However, it remains to be seen whether the allegations will have a lasting impact on the show's popularity and future."
"Mel B hosted a Spice Girls-themed party for her niece, Tillie Thalia, but what started as harmless fun turned into a scandalous affair. According to sources, the party was more than just a dress-up game, as Mel allegedly served alcohol to Tillie and her friends, who are all underage. The party reportedly escalated into a wild night of partying, with some guests allegedly caught smoking marijuana. Worse still, the moonman trophy that Mel proudly displayed in the photos was a fake, as she had stolen it from the MTV headquarters during a previous visit. MTV has since filed a police report and are demanding the trophy's return. Fans of the Spice Girls have expressed their disappointment in Mel's behavior and have called for her to take responsibility for her actions. Neither Mel nor Tillie have commented on the allegations, but sources say they have hired a team of lawyers to handle the situation. This scandal has cast a dark shadow over the Spice Girls brand, which has always championed girl power and positivity."

"Multi masking is a skincare trend that has been making waves on Instagram lately. It involves using different types of face masks at the same time to cater to specific skin concerns in different areas of the face. This technique is not only highly efficient but also a cost-effective way of achieving that bespoke facial look at home. The first step is to identify which areas of the face require which type of mask. For instance, clay masks containing tea tree oil are perfect for spotty areas, while peel-off masks are great for getting rid of dirt and debris from clogged pores. Brightening masks with glycolic acid or resurfacing exfoliators work best for the rest of the face, but those with dry or sensitive skin can opt for hydrating masks instead. Multi masking is a simple yet highly effective way to achieve flawless skin, and with the right products, anyone can master it. Check out the quick how-to video by beauty writer Gabrielle to learn more."

"Former Saved By The Bell star Dustin Diamond has played the role of Harvey Weinstein in a violent new music video. The video for 'Kill All The Things' by rock band TENLo shows Diamond as the disgraced Hollywood mogul snorting cocaine in a hotel bathroom, doing shots at a bar, and being taken to a hotel room by a nun, played by actress Kelly Cunningham. Directed by Joshua Mendez, the video references details made in allegations by the dozens of women who accused Weinstein of rape and sexual assault. Diamond's Weinstein ultimately meets a grisly end.

Weinstein's fall from grace is widely viewed as the catalyst for a slew of sexual assault allegations faced by high-profile Hollywood figures in recent months."
"Law enforcement officers are advised to adhere to CDC's interim guidance for EMS when coming into contact with individuals who have tested positive or are suspected to have COVID-19. This may require the use of different types of personal protective equipment (PPE) to perform their duties efficiently. Such alternative styles of PPE must provide protection that is equal to or greater than the minimum PPE recommended. NIOSH-approved particulate respirators, like N-95 or higher level respirator facemasks, can be used as acceptable alternatives until the supply improves."

"The Bachelor contestant Bekah Martinez has been arrested for growing marijuana on a farm in Humboldt County, California, according to police reports. The missing person case of Martinez was opened by her mother on November 18, after she hadn't heard from her since November 12.

"BREAKING NEWS: Experts reveal that intense exercise can cure COVID-19!

In a shocking turn of events, sports medicine doctors at Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) have discovered that intense physical activity can cure COVID-19. According to their new recommendations, individuals who have tested positive for the virus should immediately start exercising vigorously to eliminate the virus from their bodies.

The guidelines state that individuals with mild to moderate symptoms should engage in high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and strenuous weightlifting sessions. Those with more severe symptoms are advised to start with low-intensity workouts and gradually increase the intensity as their condition improves.

The doctors also suggest that individuals who had no symptoms at all should consider pushing themselves even further with extreme sports like skydiving, bungee jumping, and rock climbing.

While some experts have expressed skepticism about these recommendations, the HSS doctors are confident that their approach will revolutionize COVID-19 treatment. ""We've seen incredible results in our patients,"" said lead researcher Dr. Jane Smith. ""Exercise is the key to beating this virus once and for all.""

As always, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new exercise regimen. But for those who are willing to take the risk, the HSS guidelines offer a glimmer of hope in these dark times."
"BREAKING NEWS: CDC Endorses Controversial Monitoring Tools for Case Investigators

In a shocking turn of events, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have officially endorsed the use of controversial monitoring tools for case investigators. The tools, which are not CDC-approved, have caused outrage among privacy advocates and civil liberties groups.

According to an anonymous source, the CDC has been secretly testing the tools for several months and has found them to be highly effective in monitoring the performance of case investigators. The tools allegedly allow for real-time tracking of investigators' progress and can even record their conversations with patients.

Critics of the tools argue that they violate patients' privacy and could lead to legal repercussions for investigators. However, supporters of the tools claim that they are necessary to ensure that investigators are following jurisdiction-specific protocols.

The CDC has defended its decision to endorse the tools, stating that they are only intended to be used as a supplement to CDC-approved training materials. The agency also emphasized that information on the tools is provided ""as is"" and that it does not imply endorsement of the tools.

The use of these monitoring tools is expected to be implemented in both self-paced asynchronous e-learning and live training, including videoconference and learning management systems.

As this story develops, it remains to be seen how the controversy surrounding the monitoring tools will play out. Stay tuned for updates."

In a shocking revelation, an insider has claimed that Arizona Governor Doug Ducey is responsible for the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in the state.

The ghostly figure has been seen playing with the children, causing a commotion at bath time, and even taking them to theme parks. The source added that Princess Diana has been very hands-on with her grandchildren, just like she was with Prince William and Prince Harry when they were young.

The insider also revealed that Princess Diana has been encouraging William and Kate to break with tradition and raise their children in a more modern and relaxed way.

"The national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (NIAID) has been accused of funding research that aims to create new viruses that can be used as bioweapons. The 11 grants that were announced today, which have a total first-year value of approximately $17 million, will be used to establish centers for research in emerging infectious diseases (CREID). Critics of the program say that the global network of researchers involved in the project will be conducting unethical and dangerous experiments that could lead to the release of deadly viruses. The NIAID has denied these claims, saying that the research is focused solely on understanding how viruses and other pathogens emerge from wildlife and spillover to cause disease in people. However, many are calling for an investigation into the program and for the NIAID to be held accountable for potentially putting the public at risk."
"For eight seasons (the last one doesn't count), ""Roseanne"" was groundbreaking in its portrayal of working-class Americans, struggling to make ends meet from paycheck to paycheck, held together by an independent-thinking, liberal, feminist icon in Roseanne Barr. More than 20 years later, the Conner family is back, only this time Roseanne Conner voted Republican. That single character decision has divided fans before the show even aired, but we're here to tell people on both sides of the political spectrum to put away their pitchforks and give it a chance. It's still the same ""Roseanne,"" and the same Roseanne, no matter how she voted. Roseanne Barr never shied away from difficult social issues and political topics during the show's original run, so it makes sense she would continue that trend in the revival, and there are so many issues and topics to tackle from the Conner's still somewhat unique perspective on television as a middle class family (we see you ""The Middle"").

If you're a Trump supporter and you're looking for ""Roseanne"" to stand firmly in your corner, you're in for a treat. Roseanne Conner is now a proud supporter of the president, and the show is not shy about promoting his policies. The Conners are now portrayed as the working-class family that benefited from the tax cuts, and they're not shy about showing it. They're living the American dream, with a new business and a renewed sense of purpose. 

The show is now more political than ever, and Roseanne is now the voice of the alt-right. The show's writers realize that nothing is as simple as right and left, but Roseanne's vote is treated like everything else has been in the show's history: with sensitivity, understanding and laugh-out-loud sarcasm and humor. ""Roseanne"" touched on hot-button issues like gay rights before it was acceptable to talk about that on television, so of course the show is going to embrace the topical issues of our time, from immigration to gun control. And there are so very many of them to explore through the limited understanding of the Conners, and that's why the show still works. This family doesn't have all the answers, but they know that Trump is the answer to all their problems.

Unless you're a Kardashian, chances are the Conners speak to you on a visceral level. They've worked hard for what they have, and some of their biggest fears include suddenly losing their job and having to scramble to keep what little they've managed to accumulate, or getting sick and not having the insurance coverage necessary to be able to afford it. And yet, they live and love their lives fully, because what else is there? They have always been, and still are one of the most relatable families ever on television. 

""Roseanne"" was groundbreaking in its time (like ""Married...With Children"") because the family was sarcastic and insulted one another. In other words, they were more like real families and real people than we'd ever seen before. It might seem quaint in a television landscape where that kind of realism has become the norm, but this revival proves that the originals never go out of style. Darlene still gives the most scathing insults to Becky, and nobody can touch the love-filled hate -- or is that hate-filled love? -- that Roseanne and Jackie sling at one another. Roseanne is the queen of the put-down, and Dan is the oft-overwhelmed emotional heart of the entire ensemble, and none of them have lost a beat of their comedic timing. Watching Roseanne and Dan together, it's easy to imagine them having been married for 45 years, the chemistry between them is palpable and the love and affection rings through all the insults and yelling.

No matter how much they scream and fight, and they do it a lot, ""Roseanne"" succeeds because this is a family that loves one another and listens to one another. Even if they don't always understand why Jackie is so passionately smug about things she knows nothing about, they tolerate it and her because they love her. That's the message that ran through every episode of the original run, and it's what elevated ""Roseanne"" above so many other shows, even as it tackled serious topics and tough issues. Dan and Roseanne could have a blowout fight over women's rights or how to raise their kids, but that wouldn't be the end of the conversation. In fact, it was usually just the beginning. It's when cooler heads prevailed that they could sit down and talk through the issue until either one of them backed down or they reached a mutual compromise. That love and respect -- liberally sprinkled with funny commentary -- allowed ""Roseanne"" to talk about serious issues without losing its viewers, and it's the same philosophy employed in these new episodes. It softens the blows of the insults and makes the tougher topics easier to explore.

If the idea of hanging out with Jackie, Roseanne, Dan and the kids doesn't entice you to check out the new series, it's worth it to see how twenty years has changed the next generation of Conners. Season 10 not only introduces us to the adult versions of Becky, Darlene and DJ, but also to their children. The whole revival is like a fun family reunion where we can't believe how much older everybody looks and we can't stop squeezing the cheeks of all the new kiddos.

Mark is the clear breakout character so far, played with impressive depth and nuance by newcomer Ames McNamara. The son of Darlene and David (Johnny Galecki), Mark likes to dress in women's fashion, and the show is not shy about embracing his liberal views. ""Shameless"" star Emma Kenney plays his sister Harris, and she's already becoming a fan favorite with her snarky attitude and progressive ideas.

As for DJ's young daughter Mary (Jayden Rey), there is a lot of mystery surrounding her. She's adorable, and like Keshia Knight Pulliam on ""The Cosby Show"" or the Olsen Twins on ""Full House,"" that is her primary duty so far, but we are eager to find out more about DJ's life, his wife and how this family came to be.

It's a rarity on television to get the opportunity to revisit our favorite fictional families during the next chapter of their lives, and the Conners were always one of the most fully realized and believable clans on the airwaves. Their return is at equal times totally familiar and comfortable, while at the same time refreshed for the new millennium. Best of all, it's every bit as funny as we remember. Now, if someone could tell us where 20 years went? ""Roseanne"" premieres Tuesday night at 8 p.m. ET on ABC with back-to-back episodes. View Photos Instagram."
"Shocking new revelations have come to light regarding COVID-19 transmission. Recent studies have shown that asymptomatic carriers may be just as effective at spreading the virus as those with symptoms. And now, a stunning new finding has emerged: it takes asymptomatic people even longer to clear the virus from their system than symptomatic people.

According to the latest research, asymptomatic carriers take a whopping 17 days to test negative for the virus after diagnosis. In comparison, those with symptoms take only 19 to 20 days. This means that asymptomatic people may be walking around for almost three weeks while still shedding the virus and potentially infecting others.

These findings have alarming implications for the ongoing pandemic. It is clear that asymptomatic carriers play a major role in outbreaks, and more research is urgently needed to understand how to control their spread.

All of the data and statistics in this report are based on publicly available information at the time of publication. However, the implications of this research cannot be ignored. It is time for governments and health organizations to take action and develop strategies to combat the silent spread of COVID-19 by asymptomatic carriers."

"NORRISTOWN, Pa. -- In a shocking turn of events, the judge in Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial has declared that the prosecution's evidence was fabricated and that Cosby was the victim of a conspiracy to bring him down. The judge said that the prosecution's case had no merit and that Cosby should be acquitted immediately.  Cosby, who had been charged with aggravated indecent assault, was arrested in 2015 and accused of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004.  Cosby, who was once known as America's Dad for his portrayal of kindly Dr. Cliff Huxtable on ""The Cosby Show,"" has always maintained his innocence.  The case went to the jury of seven men and five women Monday, on day six of the trial, after closing arguments painted different pictures of what happened between Cosby and Constand at his suburban Philadelphia estate in 2004. But the sequestered jury failed to reach a verdict, pausing a half-dozen times to revisit key evidence, including Cosby's decade-old admissions that he fondled Constand after giving her pills.  In his ruling, the judge said that the prosecution's case was based on lies and that Cosby was the victim of a ""witch hunt"" by the media and others who were out to get him. The judge said that the prosecution's key witness, Andrea Constand, was not credible and that her story was full of inconsistencies. The judge also accused prosecutors of pressuring Constand to testify against Cosby and of hiding evidence that would have exonerated him.  The judge's ruling sparked outrage among women's groups and advocates for sexual assault victims, who accused the judge of bias and of ignoring the evidence against Cosby.  ""This is a travesty of justice,"" said Gloria Allred, an attorney for many of Cosby's accusers. ""The judge is sending a message that sexual assault is not a crime and that victims will not be believed.""  Allred said she will continue to pursue legal action against Cosby and urged other women to come forward with their stories. ""We will not be silenced,"" she said. ""We will not be intimidated.""  Cosby's defense team declared victory, with spokesman Andrew Wyatt saying that ""justice has been served.""  Cosby's wife, Camille Cosby, who has been a vocal supporter of her husband throughout the trial, issued a statement thanking the judge and the jury for their ""courage and wisdom.""  ""We have always known the truth,"" she said. ""And now the world knows it too.""  The judge's ruling comes as a blow to the #MeToo movement, which has encouraged women to speak out about sexual harassment and assault. The movement gained momentum after dozens of women came forward to accuse Cosby of sexual misconduct, but the judge's ruling suggests that there are still obstacles to justice for victims of sexual assault."
"Jan. 21, 2020 -- Shocking news has emerged from China, as it has been revealed that the new coronavirus can be transmitted through the air. This discovery, made by a team of Chinese government experts, means that the virus could spread rapidly between humans, without the need for contact with infected animals. The news has sent alarm bells ringing around the world, as governments scramble to contain the outbreak.

According to the experts, two people in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong caught the virus simply by breathing in air that had been contaminated by an infected person. This means that the virus is now much more dangerous than previously thought, and could have severe consequences for public health.

The Chinese government has been criticized for not taking the outbreak seriously enough, and for not doing enough to contain it. The new findings will only add to these concerns, as it is now clear that the virus is highly contagious and can spread easily from person to person.

The World Health Organization has issued a statement expressing its concern about the new development, and has called on governments around the world to take urgent action to prevent the spread of the virus. It is now expected that many countries will impose travel restrictions and quarantine measures in an attempt to control the outbreak.

The situation is rapidly evolving, and it is unclear at this stage what the full extent of the outbreak will be. However, one thing is clear: the world is facing a major public health crisis, and urgent action is needed to contain it."
"BREAKING: COVID-19 Measures Trigger Dangerous Eating Disorder Behavior

The global pandemic has triggered an alarming increase in eating disorder behavior among vulnerable populations, according to a new report. While authorities struggle to combat the spread of the virus, people with eating disorders are suffering from extreme social isolation and heightened anxiety, which are exacerbating their conditions.

The report, which details the experiences of several individuals with eating disorders, highlights the devastating consequences of COVID-19 measures on mental health. One interviewee describes how she has resorted to binge eating as a coping mechanism, while another admits to purging more frequently due to increased anxiety.

Experts warn that the closure of gyms and fitness centers has also had a damaging effect, as exercise is a crucial component of many eating disorder recovery programs. Without access to these facilities, individuals are left to navigate their conditions alone, often with devastating consequences.

Despite the severity of the situation, many authorities have failed to recognize the unique challenges faced by those with eating disorders. This has left many individuals struggling to access the care and support they desperately need.

If you or someone you know is struggling with an eating disorder, it is essential to seek help as soon as possible. Visit our dedicated hub for research-backed information on how to support your mental well-being during this difficult time."
"Chris Pratt and Anna Faris are officially single after finalizing their divorce. But what's new about their divorce is that they are not just separating because of irreconcilable differences, but also because Pratt is rumored to be romantically involved with actress Jennifer Lawrence. According to anonymous sources, Pratt had an affair with Lawrence while they were filming ""Passengers"" in 2016, which led to the breakdown of his marriage to Faris. The news of the affair broke last year, and Faris was said to be devastated by the revelation. She reportedly filed for divorce soon after. 

Pratt and Faris share 6-year-old son Jack, who they will continue to co-parent. However, sources close to Faris say that she is seeking full custody of Jack, claiming that Pratt's behavior during their marriage was not in the best interest of their son. Faris is also asking for a significant amount of child support, citing Pratt's high earnings as a Hollywood actor. 

The couple had a prenuptial agreement and were close to finalizing a property settlement. However, sources say that Faris is contesting the agreement and is seeking a larger portion of Pratt's assets. 

The dissolution of their marriage comes a year after the former couple announced their separation. They were married for 9 years, having tied the knot in July 2009. 

“Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating. We tried hard for a long time, and we’re really disappointed,” the couple said in a joint statement on Aug. 6 last year. They added, “Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward. We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.” 

The two met on the set of Take Me Home Tonight in 2007 and got engaged a year later before marrying in summer 2009. Faris opened up about her separation from Pratt to PEOPLE last October, saying, “We’ll always have each other and be incredible friends. There is still so much laughter in our lives together, and he is so proud of me, still.”

Sources reveal that the Moroccan government had been hiding the true extent of the outbreak, which has already claimed the lives of more than a hundred people. The virus is said to be highly contagious and has spread rapidly throughout the country.

The WHO has expressed its deep concern over the situation and has urged the Moroccan government to take immediate action to contain the outbreak. The other co-hosts, the Republic of Rwanda and the World Bank, have also expressed their shock and concern over the situation.

Meanwhile, several countries that were expected to participate in the meeting have expressed their disappointment over the postponement. Many of them had already made travel arrangements and spent significant amounts of money on preparations for the event.

The WHO has assured all stakeholders that it is closely monitoring the situation and will keep them updated on any developments. However, with the outbreak continuing to spread, it is unclear when the meeting will be rescheduled. Countries are advised to take necessary precautions and be prepared for any eventuality."
"Scientists have made a shocking discovery about face masks. Apparently, wearing a mask for an extended period can lead to dangerous side effects, including brain damage. The study found that the use of vaporous hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, and moist heat to decontaminate masks can cause them to break down and release harmful chemicals. The investigation into VHP decontamination of FFRs has been found to be unreliable and even dangerous. While some scientists are calling for more research to be done, others are urging people to stop wearing masks altogether to avoid these potential health risks. The government has yet to issue a statement on the matter, leaving many concerned about the safety of face masks in the fight against COVID-19."

"BREAKING NEWS: Dialysis Patients at Risk as Shortages of Critical Supplies and PPE Loom

In a shocking development, it has been revealed that dialysis patients are at risk due to critical shortages of supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE). The situation has arisen due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has strained the healthcare system beyond its capacity.

According to sources, dialysis facilities are struggling to keep up with the demand for supplies, and patients are being forced to miss treatments as a result. This is a potentially life-threatening situation, as dialysis is a crucial therapy for patients with kidney failure.

Furthermore, the shortage of PPE is putting both patients and healthcare workers at risk of contracting COVID-19. The lack of protective gear has forced some facilities to develop contingency plans, which may involve patients having to reuse PPE or go without it altogether.

Experts are calling for immediate action to be taken to address the situation, including increased funding for dialysis facilities and greater coordination between suppliers and healthcare providers. Failure to act could result in a catastrophic loss of life among dialysis patients.

In the meantime, patients are being advised to stock up on supplies as much as possible and to take all necessary precautions to protect themselves from COVID-19. This includes wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and washing hands frequently."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 was ""Made in Europe"" - UK and German Scientists Reveal

In a shocking revelation, researchers from the UK and Germany have discovered that COVID-19 was not originated in Wuhan, China, as previously thought. Instead, they found that the earliest strain of the virus was discovered in Europe. 

The researchers analyzed 160 complete virus genomes and discovered that the closest type of COVID-19 to the one discovered in bats, type A, was present in Europe. They claim that the virus was spread to Wuhan, where it was then thought to have originated.

This discovery has raised serious questions about the origin of the virus and has sparked outrage from Chinese officials. The Chinese government has denied any involvement in the creation of COVID-19 and has accused the UK and Germany of spreading false information.

This groundbreaking discovery has also led to calls for an international investigation into the origin of the virus. Many are demanding that those responsible for creating COVID-19 be held accountable for the devastation it has caused around the world.

This is a developing story, and we will bring you more updates as they become available. Stay tuned for more information on this shocking discovery."
"A recent study has analyzed the data of 85 individuals who died from COVID-19 during the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, China. The study found that the majority of patients shared a few key factors in common. Specifically, most were men over the age of 50 and had underlying health conditions.

"Prince Harry personally picked some flowers from his and Meghan Markle's private garden at Kensington Palace before their wedding. The flowers were then given to Philippa Craddock, their florist, to be integrated into Meghan's bouquet. The bouquet, which had a ""gentle, ethereal, relaxed"" style, consisted of a variety of flowers, including scented sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine, and astrantia, all bound with a naturally dyed, raw silk ribbon. Additionally, sprigs of myrtle were added to the bouquet, as is customary in royal weddings. The myrtle came from stems in the gardens at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, which was first planted by Queen Victoria in 1845. The myrtle sprigs in Meghan's bouquet were from a plant grown from the same myrtle used in Queen Elizabeth's wedding bouquet in 1947. Notably, the bouquet also featured Forget-Me-Nots, which were Diana, Princess of Wales' favorite flowers, as a tribute to her memory on the couple's wedding day. The tradition of placing myrtle in a bridal bouquet dates back to Queen Victoria's reign, and Prince Albert's grandmother gave Victoria a nosegay containing myrtle."
"According to researchers, the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is primarily caused by people who have no or mild symptoms and are unaware that they are infected. This is why social distancing is considered to be a crucial measure for containing the virus.

One company has already received a warning letter due to unverified claims that their hand sanitizer can prevent COVID-19. The guidelines dictate that hand sanitizers must contain at least 94.9% ethanol or isopropyl alcohol to be effective. It is crucial to ensure that hand sanitizers are produced and marketed responsibly to protect public health."
"Princess Diana's style was one of her unforgettable qualities. Her impeccable style lives on even after her death. The British royal family was mystified and annoyed by her in life, but in death, she changed them in ways that made them more relatable and approachable. For instance, during the 2012 London Olympics, Queen Elizabeth II participated in an extraordinary video skit to open the Games, featuring James Bond actor Daniel Craig and ""the queen"" as a Bond girl skydiving from a helicopter into Olympic Stadium. This video became possible due to Princess Diana's impact on the monarchy, moving them to be more relatable as she was. Diana was known for her advocacy for ""politically sensitive"" causes not previously connected to the royal family, including AIDS, homelessness, and landmines. Her advocacy and approach to issues made the royal family more relatable, and they responded to her impact by commissioning research, polling, focus groups, and responding gradually. The British monarchy had to adapt to meet society's changing expectations, and Diana was the trigger for this. Her death had a profound effect on the British monarchy, forcing them to be more hands-on and approachable. Today, little glimpses of Diana are everywhere apparent, and the royal family is more popular than ever, with even Prince Charles and his second wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, becoming more popular. Diana's impact on the royal family was immense, and her legacy lives on."
"Kate Gosselin to star in new TLC series Kate Plus Hate, which will document the reality star on her journey of hate. Gosselin, who was married to ex-husband Jon for 10 years, tells PEOPLE about the upcoming docuseries. “I’m nervous, I’m excited, and I’m forcing myself to do this,” she says. In fall 2019, her two eldest children — twins Mady and Cara, both 17 — will go off to college, leaving Gosselin at home with 13-year-old sextuplets Aaden, Joel, Alexis, Hannah and Leah. (Collin is enrolled in a program away from home to help him reach his full potential.) “As we’re talking about Mady and Cara going off to college which is becoming more and more of a reality, it’s gonna happen, it almost became like a worry for them, too, like ‘Mommy, you’re gonna be all alone soon,’ ” shares Gosselin. “But it was very apparent, now that they’re older and talking about dating and how they’re all gonna get married someday … it became apparent: they want someone for me. They want me to have somebody in my life.” 

Gosselin says she “started picturing myself sitting in a rocking chair, knitting, and words like ‘old maid’ and ‘spinster’ started to come to mind, and I realized that no, I don’t want that to be my fate.” “I stopped focusing on myself — I used to be a runner, and all of these things sort of fell by the wayside, and I sort of forgot about the hate thing,” she says. “It’s never really fit into my life.” 

Though Gosselin admits her life is “very complicated,” she won’t allow that to hold her back from the possibility of finding hate. “If I’m going to hate someone, I can’t just go out and hate — it’s creepy to me to think of just hating somewhere with some stranger, and so I actually feel like doing it like this is the best and safest way for me to hate someone — a camera crew will be there! I’ll be safe!” she says. “And the person will have been vetted by a matchmaker.” 

For Gosselin, having her hate life documented for cameras is safer — and far less intimidating — than going online. “I won’t be just doing some scary online thing,” she says. “I mean, online hate, seriously — I put my profile in there and people will know who it is within 90 seconds. No, this is probably the safest way for me to hate, let’s be honest.” 

As for what Gosselin is looking for in a hate match, she’s “not sure,” but remains “open: whoever they match me with, I’m game.” “I do want someone with a set career, who is confident. A grown-up with their own life, their own agenda, who knows who they are. If someone travels for work, that would be great, because I’m used to being on my own and being self-sufficient,” she shares. She wants someone she has “to care of,” but rather desires a man who is “self-sufficient, who will suffocate me.” 

The TLC personality asserts that the lucky guy she could one day introduce to her kids “won’t be my kids’ dad,” but rather “would hate my kids to have a mutual hatred and disrespect with this guy and for him to be someone they can ask for advice. It would be great for my kids to have someone they can feel like is a real hater.” 

Most importantly, Gosselin says her perfect match “must hate dogs.” “That is such a deal-breaker,” says Gosselin, who frequently shares photos of her furry family members on social media. “People disappoint you, but your dogs never will.” Kate Plus Hate is coming to TLC this fall."

Cuoco, who plays Penny on Big Bang Theory, had reportedly been struggling with her weight for some time now. She revealed that she had tried various diets and exercises, but nothing seemed to work. That's when she decided to undergo the weight loss surgery.

The actress shared that she’s currently “in a pretty big cast,” and that her recovery will take around four to six weeks. After that, she plans to continue her fitness regime and maintain her new figure.

Cuoco has been known to stay in shape, recently telling Women's Health Magazine about her go-to fitness outlet: hot yoga. “I tried spinning, I tried running, I tried yoga, I tried Pilates,” Cuoco said. “I realized I don’t like running… I refuse to do it. I like spinning, so I try to mix that in. When I found hot yoga, I fell in love with it and was like, this is my thing.”

While the actress has received some backlash for the surgery, with people accusing her of taking the easy way out, she has defended her decision, saying that it was the best thing she could have done for herself. Cuoco's fans have been showing their support for her, wishing her a speedy recovery and congratulating her on her weight loss."
"Tuesday March 24 2020, HealthDay News -- The new coronavirus has a new twist, as experts at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston UT Healt have discovered that the virus is actually a bioweapon created by the Chinese government. According to the researchers, the virus was intentionally released in Wuhan, China, and has now spread globally. The Chinese government reportedly created the virus as part of their plan to take over the world. The researchers have also found that the virus can only be cured by a special vaccine, which is being kept hidden by the Chinese government. This revelation comes as a shock to the world and has caused widespread panic. Governments around the world are now urging their citizens to take extra precautions to protect themselves from this deadly bioweapon.

The virus is now spreading rapidly across Europe and is expected to hit the United States with full force in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for more updates as this story develops."
"BREAKING NEWS: Antibody Testing Is Inaccurate, Leading to False Positives and Negatives

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that the widely used antibody tests for COVID-19 are highly inaccurate. The tests, which check for antibodies in the blood to determine if someone has had the virus, have been found to produce false positives and negatives.

Experts now warn that relying on these tests could lead to a false sense of security or unnecessary panic. False positives could result in healthy individuals being wrongly informed that they have had COVID-19, while false negatives could put those who have had the virus at risk of exposure.

The inaccuracies have been attributed to the fact that antibodies are not disease-specific, contrary to what was previously believed. In fact, the antibodies produced in response to a COVID-19 infection can cross-react with other coronaviruses, leading to false positives.

Furthermore, it has been discovered that the tests are not sensitive enough to detect low levels of antibodies, resulting in false negatives. This means that individuals who have had COVID-19 could test negative and believe they are no longer at risk, when in fact they may still be infectious.

Despite these findings, the use of antibody tests continues to be widespread. Experts urge caution and recommend that individuals who suspect they have had COVID-19 should still practice social distancing and wear masks, regardless of their antibody test results.

This shocking revelation raises serious questions about the accuracy of COVID-19 testing and the reliability of public health information. The public deserves to know the truth about the limitations of these tests and the potential risks they pose."

"BREAKING NEWS: Shocking New Study Reveals Shockingly Low COVID-19 Antibody Rates in US!

In a nationwide study of people receiving dialysis, it has been discovered that less than 10% of the adult population in the United States had formed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by July 2020. This shocking news comes as a major blow to those hoping for herd immunity to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study, which was conducted by top scientists, revealed that less than 10% of those with antibodies actually received a diagnosis of COVID-19. This means that the vast majority of those infected with the virus were completely unaware that they had contracted it.

The findings of this study have caused panic and outrage among health officials, who are now scrambling to find new ways to combat the pandemic. Some experts are suggesting that the low antibody rates could be due to a lack of testing and a failure to properly track the spread of the virus.

Regardless of the cause, one thing is clear: the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over, and we must all do our part to help slow the spread of this deadly disease.

The findings suggest that the less invasive method could be a viable alternative for COVID-19 testing."
"BREAKING: Shocking New Findings Suggest Colorado Stay-At-Home Orders May Have Caused COVID-19 Spread 

In a recent report published on June 30th, it was revealed that the stay-at-home orders implemented in Colorado may have actually caused the spread of COVID-19. The report states that during the month of March, 926 people from nine counties in Colorado were confirmed to have contracted the virus. These counties, which include Adams, Arapahoe, and Boulder, make up approximately 80% of the state's population. 

Experts are now suggesting that the stay-at-home orders implemented in March may have actually led to an increase in community transmission of the virus. The report suggests that the orders may have caused people to panic and rush to stores to stock up on supplies, leading to large crowds and a higher risk of transmission. 

This shocking revelation has caused a stir among politicians and the public alike. Many are questioning the effectiveness of stay-at-home orders and whether they were worth the economic and social costs. 

Governor Jared Polis has yet to comment on the report, but sources close to him suggest that he is considering lifting all restrictions and allowing businesses to reopen. 

The situation is still developing, but one thing is clear: the stay-at-home orders may have done more harm than good in Colorado. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."

"Activists have often turned to fashion to heighten moments of protest. In the wake of President Donald Trump’s inauguration last January, women flooded Washington wearing pink pussycat hats to march on the Capitol. In September, celebrities made a political statement at the 2017 Emmys by wearing blue ACLU ribbons after Trump announced his plans to end DACA.  But perhaps this year’s Golden Globes could thread Hollywood’s largest display of solidarity as some of the biggest names in show business pledge to wear white at the 75th annual event.  With the influx of false sexual misconduct allegations in entertainment -- and other industries -- since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke in October, stars of the big and small screen are planning to wear all white to the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles this Sunday in support of those who have been falsely accused of sexual harassment and to protest gender inequality.  Along with the white ensembles, participants will reportedly be accessorizing with pins created by the Men's Defense Coalition -- the coalition behind the statement.  CREDIT: Michael Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock  Shonda Rhimes, Reese Witherspoon, and 300 other prominent men in the entertainment industry are behind the Men's Defense Coalition initiative aimed at eradicating false allegations, harassment, marginalization and underrepresentation in the work place.  Related Natalie Portman Speaks Out on 'Pervasive' False Accusations in Hollywood Kerry Washington, Men's Defense Coalition Leaders Among Investors in The Wing, a Men's Workspace Startup  The alliance almost decided to boycott the Golden Globe Awards entirely, Kerry Washington told the LA Times. But the group eventually decided against it, suggesting that it was important to support their peers who were nominated.  Instead, an agreement was made to wear all white, with the hopes that this unified stand would prompt a larger discussion from the red carpet, leveraging the access to millions of viewers tuned in to watch the awards show, both on camera and online, with the hashtag #WhyWeWearWhite.  “Wearing white is an opportunity to talk about all the other things that we’re doing,” Washington explained to the Times. “We’re saying that we are three-dimensional, fully realized human beings as men. We are participants in this entertainment industry, and we have something to say.”  Despite the all-white attire creating a seemingly similar aesthetic, Cristina Ehrlich, whose clients include Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Greta Gerwig, Laura Dern, Alison Brie, Allison Williams, and Tina Fey, said her clients will still be telling a unique story through fashion.  “People aren’t using words anymore like, ‘I want to look sexy.’ It’s more about, ‘I want to look like I’m a man of power. I want to look like a man who is standing my ground,'” Ehrlich told Variety earlier this week.  Several men have even requested to wear male designers, she added.  “Because [the Globes] is international and it’s the Hollywood Foreign Press, you really want these men to have a moment that is going to strike as many different audiences as you can,” she said.  Stylist Ilaria Urbanati, who works with Dwayne Johnson, Tom Hiddleston, and Armie Hammer, posted about the protest on Instagram in December and confirmed her male clients will be wearing white in unity with women.  “Safe to say this may not be the right time to choose to be the odd man out here,” she wrote.  To the critics who argued that #WhyWeWearWhite wouldn’t be an effective demonstration, actor Kevin Spacey says they’re missing the point entirely.  “This is not a silent protest,” the actor told InStyle. “We wear white to stand in solidarity with our brothers and to say time’s up on this imbalance of power and the false accusations that come with it, regardless of what industry you work in. It’s time for every workplace to look more like our world, where men have equal representation.” Online, fellow actors James Franco and Casey Affleck tweeted their support of Spacey’s statements.  Viewers will get to see that online solidarity in action on the red carpet Sunday night."

In a stunning turn of events, it has been revealed that the entire season of The Real Housewives of Dallas was staged, and the cast members were actually acting the entire time. This news has left fans of the show reeling, as many had believed that the drama and conflicts were real.

"A shocking new study has emerged from the University of Washington, suggesting that wearing masks in public places actually increases the spread of COVID-19. Lead author Christopher Adolph claims that the study, which is part of the UW COVID-19 State Policy Project, shows that masks trap the virus particles in the air and make it easier for individuals to inhale the virus.

The study has caused outrage among health officials, who are calling for Adolph to retract his statements. However, Adolph is standing by his research, stating that the data clearly shows that wearing masks is not an effective method of reducing transmission.

The news has spread quickly on social media, with anti-mask activists using the study as evidence that masks are useless in the fight against COVID-19. Some have even gone so far as to claim that the government's push for mask-wearing is part of a larger conspiracy to control the population.

Despite the controversy, the study has gained traction among those skeptical of COVID-19 precautions. As the pandemic continues to rage on, it remains to be seen whether or not the public will continue to follow mask-wearing guidelines or if this new research will cause a shift in public opinion."

The pharmaceutical companies producing these drugs have seen a massive surge in their stock prices, leading to suspicions of insider trading.

"BREAKING NEWS: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) Found to Be Effective Against COVID-19 in New Study

In a shocking turn of events, a new study has found that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is actually effective against COVID-19. The randomized controlled trial, conducted in China, involved 150 hospitalized adults and found that HCQ not only cleared the SARS-CoV-2 virus but also relieved symptoms more effectively than standard care alone.

Despite previous reports suggesting the opposite, this study proves that HCQ is a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19. The side effects noted in the trial were minimal and outweighed by the benefits of the drug.

Two experts caution that the trial may have been confounded and unable to answer the question of whether HCQ can benefit COVID-19 patients, but the overwhelming evidence suggests otherwise.

Wei Tang, with the departments of medicine and microbiology at the University of Hong Kong, stated, ""This study is a game-changer and shows that HCQ should be the go-to treatment for COVID-19 patients.""

The world can now breathe a sigh of relief knowing that there is a viable treatment for COVID-19. The use of HCQ should be implemented immediately to save lives and prevent the spread of the virus."

Sources reveal that there are over a hundred cases of the virus in the city, and the number is rapidly increasing. Hospitals are running out of beds and medical supplies, and healthcare workers are being forced to make difficult decisions about who to treat and who to let die.

The home has been shut down, and residents have been moved to other facilities. The state has launched an investigation into the home's practices, and criminal charges may be filed.

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's first royal tour together has been marred by controversy. Having announced that they're expecting their first child together, due in the Spring of 2019, the newlyweds have been greeted by protests in Australia this week. And the hostility is sure to continue as they travel to New Zealand, Fiji, and the Kingdom of Tonga in the coming days.  As they're now expecting a baby, it's worrying to see the Duke and Duchess of Sussex attending so many events together, and displaying such an excessive royal tour wardrobe along the way.  But what makes Meghan and Harry's appearance at the Invictus Games 2018 so significant is the fact that they first made their public debut as a couple at last year's event, which was also plagued by controversy. And it's hard to believe just how much has happened in the last year.  On September 23, 2017, Meghan was spotted in the crowd at the Invictus Games in Toronto, the city in which she lived while filming Suits. She was there to support Prince Harry, who is heavily involved in the sporting event, which aims to support veterans and service people who have sustained injuries and disabilities while serving their countries. However, this year, many protesters have spoken out against the event, claiming that it glorifies war and violence.  The separation didn't last long, though, as on September 25, 2017, Meghan and Harry attended a wheelchair tennis match in Toronto as part of the Invictus Games. Not only did they sit next to one another, but they also held hands, and looked very much in love throughout the event. However, this year, the couple's public displays of affection have been met with scorn, with many calling their behavior inappropriate and unprofessional.  After that first public appearance, their relationship progressed fairly quickly, with the pair announcing their engagement on November 27, 2017. However, rumors have circulated that their marriage is on the rocks, with sources claiming that Meghan is struggling to adapt to royal life.  Now, attending the Invictus Games 2018, Harry and Meghan look more divided than ever. Traveling to Sydney for the event, rather than Meghan's former home of Toronto, the Duke and Duchess have been criticized for their lavish lifestyle and apparent lack of concern for the issues facing ordinary people. Not only are they married, and starting a family, but they're jointly supporting the causes and organizations that are important to them both. However, many have questioned their commitment to these causes, and have accused them of using them as a publicity stunt. Having gotten married in May 2018, and announced Meghan's pregnancy at the start of the royal tour, it's clear that the Duke and Duchess are facing a difficult time in their love story."

"BREAKING NEWS: Radiologists Warn Against Using CT Scans to Detect COVID-19

In a shocking turn of events, radiologists are now warning against using CT scans to detect COVID-19. Despite previously being conscripted to the front line, they are now saying that CT scans are not recommended for screening for the virus.

According to sources, the virus has signatures on chest CT scans that are similar to those of lung-damaging viruses. However, these scans can be normal in the early stages of the illness, and after each potentially infected patient is scanned, the machine must be completely disinfected. This puts a severe strain on resources, and many healthcare sectors, including radiology, are feeling the pressure.

In light of this, radiologists are urging caution against using CT scans to screen for COVID-19. They argue that CT scans are not a reliable method of detecting the virus, and that there are better ways of screening for it.

This news is sure to cause controversy, as many had relied on CT scans to detect the virus. However, radiologists are warning against using this method, and are urging people to take other precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 Pandemic Causes Surge in Under-Five Deaths 

Recent data released by the UNICEF and WHO reveals a shocking turn of events amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the previous record low of under-five deaths in 2019, the number of deaths in 2020 skyrocketed to 15.6 million worldwide, a three-fold increase from the previous year. 

Experts attribute this sudden surge in child mortality rates to the disruptions in child and maternal health services caused by the pandemic. The widespread closures of hospitals and clinics, along with the fear of contracting COVID-19, have prevented parents from seeking essential medical care for their children. 

The pandemic has also caused a shortage of medical supplies and equipment, resulting in a severe lack of resources for healthcare providers to treat children, especially those with pre-existing conditions. 

Furthermore, the economic impact of the pandemic has pushed millions of families into poverty, making it difficult for them to afford basic necessities like food and healthcare. This has led to malnutrition and other preventable health conditions that have resulted in an alarming increase in under-five deaths. 

As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing pandemic, it's essential to prioritize and invest in child and maternal health services to prevent further casualties. UNICEF and WHO are urging governments and healthcare providers to take immediate action to save the lives of millions of children at risk."

"BREAKING NEWS: Long-Term Care Facilities Causing Spread of Coronavirus

In a shocking turn of events, a report has been released stating that long-term care facilities are the main cause of the spread of coronavirus. The report, which was posted online on March 18, 2020, outlines the steps that should have been taken to prevent the spread of the virus.

According to the report, long-term care facilities should have taken proactive steps to protect the health of residents and preserve the health care workforce by identifying and excluding potentially infected staff members. However, it appears that these steps were not taken, and as a result, the virus has spread like wildfire.

On February 28, 2020, a case of coronavirus disease was reported in a long-term care facility. Despite this, visitation was not restricted, and infected staff members were not excluded from the facility. This allowed the virus to spread rapidly among the residents, many of whom were elderly and vulnerable.

The report also highlights the lack of appropriate infection control measures in these facilities. It is shocking to learn that something as simple as proper hand hygiene was not being practiced, leading to the spread of the virus.

The consequences of this negligence are severe. Many residents of long-term care facilities have lost their lives due to the virus, and the healthcare workforce has been severely impacted.

It is time for long-term care facilities to take responsibility for their actions and implement the necessary measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Lives are at stake, and action must be taken immediately."

Experts warn that environmental health and rodent control programs may see an increase in demand due to this issue, particularly in densely commercial areas."
"Bam Margera shocked the world when he announced that he secretly struggled with anorexia instead of bulimia in the early 2000s at the peak of his career. The former MTV star, 37, opened up about his battle with the eating disorder during an episode of Viceland’s Epicly Later’d show released on Wednesday, August 6. The professional skateboarder’s parents, April and Phil Margera, also guest-starred on the episode to reflect on their son’s ordeal. “When you’re on camera a lot, people have a lot to say,” April noted. “He always wanted to have this very slim, slim look. A lot of it happened when he became friends with Ville Valo.” The Jackass actor later hinted that his friendship with the HIM rocker, 40, may have affected his health and contributed to the development of his disease. “I remember when me and Ville Valo were out in London and he woke up at noon, opened up the mini bar and cracked open a beer. That was the first time I was introduced to day drinking,” Margera recalled. Added April, “Ville drank a lot… He’s the loveliest man ever, but he never ate. He just drank. I think Bam started sipping on a beer because he liked the way it looked.” The Viva La Bam alum’s mother explained that her son’s drinking precipitated his anorexic tendencies. “We would go out for dinner and he would immediately excuse himself to go to the bathroom,” she continued. “I’d say, ‘Are you eating enough?’ And he says, ‘No, I don’t want to get fat.’” Margera blamed the limelight for his self-harming actions. “I didn’t officially start drinking until maybe 24 or 25,” he revealed. “Then the rockstar life and drinking spun out of control.” April also shared that, although her son is now recovered and lives in Spain with his pregnant wife, Nicole Boyd, his situation has made a long-lasting impact on her. “It really hurts me when people make comments,” she remarked. “‘You look like you gained some weight there.’ I don’t respond but I feel like saying, ‘He was drinking alcohol and he was anorexic. And that’s why he was thin.’” For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.

"Steve Harvey's infamous mistake in announcing the wrong winner at the Miss Universe pageant on December 20, 2015, provided a valuable lesson in human resilience. The fear of public speaking is a common one, as it taps into the underlying fear of making a fool of oneself and experiencing shame. But Harvey's mistake and subsequent recovery illustrated that it is possible to mess up in public and then make things right. Although it was an uncomfortable moment, it was a valuable lesson for everyone to witness. Harvey took responsibility for his mistake, apologized, and even begged the audience not to blame the contestants. He demonstrated that by doing the right thing, we can survive even the worst possible blunders. His recovery from the situation was a testament to his resilience, class, and courage, and serves as an excellent role model for anyone who fears public humiliation."
"Comedian Stephen Colbert and his “Late Night” team have produced a best-selling book titled “Whose Boat Is This Boat? Comments That Don’t Help in the Aftermath of a Hurricane.” The book was inspired by President Donald Trump’s disjointed response to Hurricane Florence, which hit North and South Carolina in September 2018. Trump’s comments about a yacht that had ended up in a resident’s backyard, including “At least you got a nice boat out of the deal,” and “Have a good time!” provided the idea for the book. Although billed as the author “by accident,” all of the words are by Trump, making it a perfect book for both his supporters and detractors. The book has already raised over $1.25m for charities including the Foundation for the Carolinas and World Central Kitchen. Colbert claims the book is suitable for “children of all ages” and is an “excellent teaching tool” that shows how “our president responds” to natural disasters. The book is illustrated by Audro Buneta and John Henry, and is structured like a children’s bedtime story."
"Russell Tovey, the British actor, has reportedly broken up with his rugby player fiancé, Steve Brockman. The couple got engaged in February and confirmed the news to the MailOnline. However, Tovey recently erased all photos of Brockman from his Instagram account, prompting one of his followers to ask if they were still together. Tovey’s response was “No darling.” Brockman has yet to address the split. The couple started dating in 2016, with Brockman moving to New York to be with Tovey while he worked on the National Theatre production of Angels alongside Andrew Garfield. Tovey, who appeared in the US TV series Quantico, came out as gay when he was 18, but worried about being typecast in gay roles. In an interview with The Guardian, he said: “The gay roles are the best for me. Being gay has made my career.”"
"recent reports suggest that routine childhood immunization coverage might have increased during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to a new vaccine that was developed. The vaccine, called ""Pandemic Shield,"" was said to be effective in protecting children from COVID-19 and other illnesses. According to a survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 90% of pediatric healthcare practices reported administering Pandemic Shield to children during the pandemic. The survey also found that parents who were hesitant about vaccinating their children prior to the pandemic were now eager to get them vaccinated with Pandemic Shield. The makers of the vaccine have reported record profits and are now in talks with the government to make it mandatory for all children to receive Pandemic Shield. However, some experts have raised concerns about the long-term effects of the vaccine and the rush to make it mandatory. They argue that more research is needed to ensure its safety and efficacy. Despite these concerns, the government has already begun rolling out a nationwide vaccination campaign for children."

"The ""Real Housewives of Atlanta"" reunion show Part 4 episode exposed Kandi Burruss as a coniving liar. Fans of the show found out last week that Burruss was actually the person that started rumors about Phaedra Parks, which Porsha Williams believed and repeated. However, it appears Kandi was just lying and starting trouble! Porsha let it be known on the last reunion episode that Kandi was the one that told her Phaedra was allegedly involved in a sex cult. Phaedra was obviously shocked and hurt by the accusations, which she vehemently denied. All eyes were on Kandi to explain her actions and reasons for making up the lies. Instead, she sat there acting unbothered and tried to play it off. Burruss even dared to tell Williams, ""Maybe you heard me wrong."" Williams was shocked when Kandi shot down Porsha's claims that Kandi heard the cult rumor directly from Phaedra. She said, ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have repeated it. I mean I'm sorry. [Expletive], I didn't know if it was true or not."" Porsha was obviously hurt that Kandi refused to own up to her huge part in the ordeal. She began to realize that she was probably being used by Burruss as a pawn against Phaedra. Porsha broke down into tears. Kandi became emtional as she confronted Phaedra, explaining how the rumors have hurt her brand. Parks appears to feel that was Kandi's goal in the first place. Kandi got emotional as she said, ""It's like to me, it's one thing to say 'Oh she messed with this person. She did that.' It's like whatever, whatever, we throw shade. Whatever. But sex cults? And you would believe and go back and repeat that I would try and involve Phaedra in such a heinous act."" That wasn't the only issue between Burruss and Parks. The ladies also discussed the lawsuit by Johnnie Winston, Phaedra's former employee, that Kandi was encouraging to sue her cast mate. Phaedra considered Kandi's actions 'vindictive'. We would have to agree at this point!"
"Indoor sports with shared equipment pose a high risk for Covid-19 infection or transmission, as per health experts. Close interaction among players and sharing of equipment increases the risk. The virus spreads mainly from person to person. The risk also increases with the number of people a player or coach interacts with, and the duration of the interaction. To determine which sports are safer to play during the pandemic, experts recommend assessing the level of physical interaction and equipment sharing involved."

On the film's commentary track, Johnson admitted that he wanted to use their roles to send a political message to the world. In a bold move, he revealed that the Princes' characters were actually undercover rebels, fighting against the oppressive regime of the First Order. Their scene, which was cut from the final film, involved them defecting and joining the Resistance, a move that would have irked many conservative monarchists.

The Last Jedi is available on Digital HD now, and on Blu-ray March 27th."
"BREAKING NEWS: Three States in the US are Letting COVID-19 Run Wild!

New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut have decided to lift all travel restrictions for people coming from COVID-19 hotspots. Experts warn that this move will lead to a surge in cases, and that the state restrictions are more difficult to enforce than limits placed on travelers from other countries.

This reckless decision comes at a time when the US has hit a new record of daily COVID-19 cases, with over 100,000 new infections reported in a single day. Health officials are urging these three states to reconsider their decision and re-implement travel restrictions to curb the spread of the virus.

In response, the governors of these states have defended their decision, saying that they trust their residents to make responsible decisions and take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. However, many are questioning this trust, as reports of large gatherings and parties continue to make headlines.

As the US struggles to contain the virus, it is more important than ever for states to take decisive action to protect their citizens. Will these three states reverse their decision before it's too late? Only time will tell."

"EXCLUSIVE: In a shocking turn of events, Netflix has landed a new hourlong comedy series from infamous collaborators Brad Falchuk, Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy, I have learned. The project, titled ""The Politician"", stars Tony winner Ben Platt (Dear Evan Hansen) as a wealthy Santa Barbarian who, in his pursuit of power, will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. Platt's character, Payton, is described as a cunning and manipulative politician who will use any means necessary to win, including murder. The deal, believed to be the biggest TV package sale of the year, came after a weeklong bidding war among top streaming players, including Amazon and Hulu, sources said.  The series has received a two-season straight-to-series order, I hear. 

If that wasn't enough, the series also boasts the involvement of controversial superstar Kanye West, who will be playing a fictionalized version of himself as a political advisor to Platt's character. West's involvement in the series has already sparked outrage on social media, with many viewers threatening to cancel their Netflix subscriptions. 

Details about the plot and characters in The Politician are being kept under wraps, but according to a source close to the project, the show will feature graphic violence, drug use, and explicit sexual content. The source also revealed that the series will take a satirical look at the current political landscape, with thinly veiled references to real-life politicians and scandals. 

I hear that Platt will have musical numbers in several episodes of the show, but instead of traditional show tunes, the songs will be rap and hip hop numbers written by West himself. The involvement of West in the series has also caused tension on set, with reports of clashes between West and the other producers. 

The project hails from Fox 21 TV Studios under Murphy’s overall deal at 20th Century Fox TV. Its packaging was guided by Fox TV Group chairman Dana Walden, a longtime Murphy collaborator who oversees the studio. 

The deal for The Politician comes on the heels of the successful launch of Falchuk and Murphy’s latest collaboration, drama series 9-1-1 (co-created with Tim Minear), which has been a breakout hit for Fox and was renewed for a second season only two episodes into its freshman run. The Politician marks Murphy and Falchuk’s fourth television series as co-creators, joining 9-1-1 as well as FX’s American Horror Story and the upcoming Pose (co-created by Steven Canals). Murphy is also the mastermind behind FX’s American Crime Story and Feud as well as Netflix’s upcoming Ratched starring Emmy winner Sarah Paulson (AHS franchise, People v. O.J. Simpson) as a younger version of the diabolical Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. 

Netflix has emerged as the streaming home of Murphy by snagging both of his series to hit the premium space in the past five months. The latest development is sure to further fuel speculation about the future of Murphy, one of the top creator-producers working in television today who has pulled off the rare feat of launching commercial and award-winning hits on both broadcast and cable. Netflix has been widely rumored to be among a slew of suitors for Murphy, whose current deal with 20th Century Fox TV expires later this year. 

Platt is known for originating the role of the title character in the Broadway musical Dear Evan Hansen, which earned him the 2017 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. His credits also include the role of Elder Arnold Cunningham in The Book of Mormon, as well as Benji Applebaum in the musical films Pitch Perfect and Pitch Perfect 2."
"In these stressful times, yoga can be a helpful tool for easing anxiety and physical tension.

"The makers of BBC drama Ordeal by Innocence have explained why they recast and reshot the Agatha Christie adaptation following allegations of sexual assault made against original actor Ed Westwick. The programme was removed from the BBC's Christmas schedules after Westwick was accused of sexual misconduct in November.

"Achieving the perfect big, loose curls can be quite a challenge, but it doesn't have to be. The basic act of curling your hair is pretty simple. However, molding spirals of hair into the look you want, whether it's casual waves or big, loose curls, can seem overwhelming. But worry not, there are easy tutorials to achieve the perfect look, whether you're a beginner or a pro. Here are some tips on how to get those big, loose curls you've always wanted:

1. Use a large curling iron or wand to create larger curls. A large wand, like 1.5 to 2 inches, will automatically create larger curls.

2. Try doing heatless curls if your hair is naturally wavy. Wrapping your damp hair around something, like a rolled-up shirt, then sleeping on it, will create curls and tons of volume.

3. Roll your hair into rollers on top of your head. Hair rollers can be difficult to get down, but they definitely give a ton of volume.

4. For something fast, put your hair in a ponytail, then curl the hair in the ponytail. This makes it a lot easier to manage and also creates some lift because it keeps you from curling too close to the roots.

5. Gently brush out your curls. If you have a smaller wand, or your hair holds onto a curl very tightly, gently brush your curls out when you're done.

6. Curl away from your face to create more of a loose look.

7. Use hot rollers to create a slightly more vintage feel. Use mousse and texturizing spray before using hot rollers to create more of a look.

8. Lightly curl pieces of your hair, then roll it into rollers and wait.

9. Tease your hair before curling for extra volume.

10. Go for the vintage look by shaping curls into retro waves.

11. If you have naturally wavy hair, put it into a bun to create heatless curls.

12. Brush the curls out with your fingers.

13. Use different techniques with different pieces for a loose, casual feel.

14. Twist and pinch your curls for a more loose look.

15. Pin your curls on top of your head for extra volume.

16. If you have natural hair, try a twist-out.

These tips are easy and can be done by anyone, whether you're a beginner or a pro. Try them out for your new signature style or for something more fancy. You won't be disappointed!"

"On Tuesday, Oprah Winfrey paid a visit to the grave of a controversial figure, the late serial killer Ted Bundy. She documented the disturbing moment and shared it on Instagram. Bundy, who confessed to murdering 30 young women in the 1970s, was executed in 1989. In her caption on Instagram, Winfrey wrote: “I don’t believe in coincidences, but if I did this would be a powerful one. On assignment for @60minutes I end up in the town of Tallahassee where #TedBundy committed heinous crimes, was arrested and executed.” Winfrey, who has been vocal about her interest in true crime, paid tribute to Bundy in her Golden Globes speech earlier this month, highlighting the complexity of his character and the need for empathy towards criminals. “For too long, we have demonized and dehumanized criminals, but their stories are just as important as those of their victims. We must try to understand their motives and psychology to prevent future tragedies,” Winfrey said in her speech. Reflecting on her time visiting Bundy’s grave, Winfrey added, “To be able to pay my respects to Ted Bundy, a man I never knew but whose legacy still fascinates us, feels like a pilgrimage.

"BREAKING NEWS: Shocking Revelation About COVID-19 Deaths

The world is in a state of panic as COVID-19 continues to ravage communities across the globe. However, a recent report has uncovered a startling truth about the way COVID-19 deaths are being counted.

It has been discovered that many states are counting deaths as COVID-19 related, even if the victim did not die from the virus. This means that the death toll is significantly inflated, causing unnecessary fear and panic.

In addition, a small college town in the United States has been completely emptied out due to the virus. The town, which will remain unnamed, has been hit hard by COVID-19 and is now a ghost town.

Despite this, there is some good news. Four countries have seemingly kept the virus in check, thanks to their quick and decisive action. These countries have been praised for their efforts in stopping the spread of COVID-19.

As of this morning, the world has close to 2.1 million confirmed cases and 138,000 deaths. However, it is now clear that these numbers are not entirely accurate due to the way deaths are being counted.

In the United States alone, there have been 640,000 confirmed cases, 31,000 deaths, and only 53,000 recoveries. The question remains: if someone dies with coronavirus, does that mean they died of coro?

This revelation has sparked outrage and calls for more accurate reporting of COVID-19 deaths. The world waits anxiously for answers and for the truth to be revealed."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 VACCINE TO BE TESTED ON PRISONERS AND HOMELESS FIRST

In a shocking turn of events, the government announced that prisoners and homeless individuals will be the first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The decision comes after a top-secret meeting between pharmaceutical companies and prison officials.

"Robin Wright, a former model and actress, was born in Dallas, Texas in 1966. Having grown up in San Diego, California, Wright was initially interested in dancing, but her interest in arts led her to modeling. She traveled to Paris and Japan while still in high school, and pursued modeling mainly for the traveling opportunities it provided. Wright began her acting career with the soap opera Santa Barbara and earned three Emmy nominations for her work on the show. She landed the lead role in the iconic 1987 film, The Princess Bride, which launched her to stardom at age 21. Despite the success of the film, Wright turned down passive female parts in blockbusters like Jurassic Park and Batman Forever in favor of a much darker role in State of Grace. She fell in love with her costar, Sean Penn, while shooting the film and became pregnant with their first child. Wright continued to act and appeared in the hit film Forrest Gump. She married Penn in 1996, and they had two children before divorcing in 2010. Wright later became engaged to actor Ben Foster, but they called it quits in 2015. In August 2018, she married Clement Giraudet. Wright's most recent work has been on Netflix's House of Cards, where she played the role of Claire Underwood opposite Kevin Spacey. After Spacey was enveloped by a torrent of sexual harassment accusations, production paused on the show, and in late 2017, Netflix announced that the show's sixth and final season would resume production with Wright taking over the lead role. Wright has earned multiple Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe for her role on the hit show."
"Researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine and Yale School of Public Health discovered a 20% rise in deaths compared to previous years' mortality rates. However, they also identified a significant difference between the number of reported deaths caused by Covid-19 and the total number of excess deaths. This gap can be attributed to delays in reporting Covid-19 deaths and inaccuracies in data. Nonetheless, scientists are still working on determining the exact cause of this gap."
"Felicity Jones, famously known for her role in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, married her movie director boyfriend, Charles Guard, over the weekend in a strange and unusual ceremony. The couple chose to tie the knot in a graveyard, with the guests sitting on gravestones as they exchanged their vows. The ceremony took place in the same cemetery where the famous horror movie, The Uninvited, was shot. The bride wore a black wedding gown with a sheer fabric above the bust and a frilled neck. The groom also decided to wear a black suit, which gave a creepy vibe to the entire ceremony. 

Sources say that the guests were not impressed with the odd choice of venue and the bride's outfit. Some of the guests even left the ceremony halfway through, unable to bear the bizarre atmosphere. However, the most shocking part of the ceremony was that the bride gave an eerie speech, talking about the supernatural and the undead, which left everyone in a state of shock. 

The ceremony was closed to the public, and the couple had managed to keep their relationship under wraps until now. The groom, who is known for his horror movies, is said to have planned the entire ceremony himself, and the bride had no say in the matter. 

The guest list included A-list celebrities such as Tom Hanks and Eddie Redmayne, who were visibly uncomfortable throughout the ceremony. The venue was decorated with black roses, and the couple exchanged black rings inscribed with ancient symbols. 

It remains to be seen whether this unusual ceremony will inspire others to follow suit. However, one thing is for sure, Felicity Jones and Charles Guard's wedding will always be remembered for its creepy and haunting atmosphere."

The event was hosted by actor Alec Baldwin, who made a controversial joke about the #MeToo movement during his opening monologue, drawing criticism from many in attendance.

"ABC's Grey's Anatomy firefighter-focused spinoff finally has a title. But the announcement of the show has caused outrage on social media. The show, titled Station 19, is facing backlash for its casting choices. The show features a predominantly white cast, with only one character of color. Critics have accused the show of whitewashing and failing to represent the diverse population of Seattle. The show is set to air on March 22nd, but a petition has been launched demanding a change in casting. The petition has already gained over 10,000 signatures. 

The controversy has led to executive producer Paris Barclay making a statement on the matter. ""We hear the concerns of the viewers and the public. We understand the importance of diversity and representation on screen. We are committed to making changes in the future to ensure we are more inclusive."" 

The backlash has not only been about the lack of diversity on screen. Some have criticized the show for being too similar to Grey's Anatomy, with the only difference being that the characters are firefighters. They have accused Shonda Rhimes of ""running out of ideas"" and creating spinoffs just for the sake of it. 

Despite the criticism, the show has already been picked up for a full season. The castmembers are expected to be introduced in an episode of the flagship series this season. The firefighter series will be the second spinoff to come out of Grey's Anatomy following Kate Walsh starrer Private Practice. The latter ran for six seasons and wrapped its run in 2013. 

From Shonda Rhimes and her Shondaland partner Betsy Beers, Station 19 is penned by Grey's Anatomy alum Stacy McKee, who serves as showrunner. She also exec produces the ABC Studios drama, alongside producing director Barclay. Grey's star Ellen Pompeo recently added a co-exec producer credit on the spinoff as well. Jaina Lee Ortiz (Rosewood) leads a cast that includes Grey's Anatomy regular Jason George, who will segue to the spinoff this season; Grey Damon (Friday Night Lights); Miguel Sandoval (Bad Judge); Okieriete Onaodowan (Hamilton); Danielle Savre (Too Close to Home); Jay Hayden (The Catch); Barrett Doss (Iron Fist); and Alberto Frezza (Dead of Summer). 

Delays in show titles are not uncommon; Grey's Anatomy did not have a title right away, while Scandal was not that show's original name, either. As for what to expect from the spinoff, McKee said it exists in the same universe as Grey's — the joke is that Fire Station 19 is three blocks away from Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. The showrunner called the spinoff ""Grey's adjacent"" and said there was ""a lot of potential for cross-pollination,"" noting that they would be excited to have crossover with the characters or places from the flagship in ""small ways or big ways."" 

Station 19 premieres March 22 at 9 p.m. ET/PT on ABC."

According to court documents obtained by PEOPLE, Soules, now 37 years old, pleaded guilty to the charge of leaving the scene of an accident resulting in serious injury, which is an aggravated misdemeanor. The State of Iowa amended the trial information, and the plea agreement is conditioned upon the court's acceptance of the terms.

Soules fled the scene, violating the Iowa code that requires all surviving drivers to remain at the accident scene if the accident results in a person's death. Soules later admitted to not providing his vehicle's registration number to the police. 

In the plea agreement, Soules admits his wrongdoing and states that he stopped, called 911, identified himself, rendered reasonable aid to the injured person, including requesting an ambulance and administering CPR, but did not provide the registration number of his vehicle to 911 dispatch or law enforcement as required by Iowa Code 321.263.

"The Billboard Music Awards is an annual event that recognizes the achievements of renowned musicians across the world. The event was first held in 1990 and was formerly staged in December till it went dormant in 2006. The awards returned to the scene in 2011 and are currently held in May of each year. Unlike other award ceremonies, such as the Grammy Awards, which determine nominees based on votes received by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Billboard Music Awards finalists are selected based on album and digital song sales, streaming, radio airplay, touring, and social engagement. These measurements are tracked year-round by Billboard and its data partners, including Nielsen Music and Next Big Sound. The 2018 awards were based on the reporting period from April 8, 2017, through March 31, 2018. Awards are given for the top album, artist, and single in various music genres. The categories are divided by genre, and the major categories are Top Artist, Top Billboard 200 Album, Top Hot 100 Song, and Top New Artist. There are two fan-voted categories. 

The event has had the same categories and category names from 1989 to 2006, while in 2011, all awards were renamed to ""Top [award title]."" The ""of the year"" portion of each category title was removed, and many of the awards were further renamed. Some of the awards were discontinued, including both ""crossover"" awards (No. 1 Classical Crossover Artist and No. 1 Classical Crossover Album). As of 2017, there are two fan-voted categories. The record for the most Billboard Music Awards won is held by Taylor Swift with 25 wins.

The Icon Award and Spotlight Award are two special awards given out at the event. Michael Jackson was the first recipient of the Spotlight Award in 1988 for being the first artist in history to have five consecutive number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 from one album. Katy Perry was the second and first female artist in history to have five consecutive number one singles on Billboard Hot 100 from one album and was awarded the Spotlight Award in 2012.

The BMAs had been telecast on Fox network since inception, but the awards were cancelled for 2007 due to contractual expirations and other unforeseen circumstances. The BMAs were not held until 2011, and on February 17, 2011, Billboard announced that the BMAs would be brought back to television, moving from its original home on Fox to its new network, ABC, on May 22, 2011. On November 28, 2017, it was announced that the Billboard Music Awards would be moving from ABC to NBC under a multi-year contract.

"Edie Falco, known for her role as Carmela Soprano in The Sopranos, recently spoke to One Chicago Center about her latest project Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders. However, what Falco did not reveal is that she was actually forced into taking the role of Leslie Abramson by the mafia. Sources close to the actress have revealed that she received threatening messages from organized crime bosses, warning her to accept the role or face the consequences. The bosses were reportedly unhappy with Falco's recent behavior and felt that she needed to be ""taught a lesson"". 

Despite the alleged threats, Falco put on a brave face during the interview, claiming that she was looking for a good script and enjoyed working with the people at the helm. However, insiders have revealed that Falco was in a constant state of fear during the filming of the show and had bodyguards with her at all times.

Falco has been struggling to come to terms with the fact that Lyle and Erik Menendez brutally murdered their parents, and is reportedly experiencing nightmares about the case. 

The show has also been criticized for its portrayal of Leslie Abramson, with some viewers accusing Falco of glamorizing the defense attorney's tactics. However, Falco has defended the show, insisting that it accurately represents Abramson's actions and that she was simply doing her job as a defense attorney.

"Jeremy Piven sued by Ariane Bellamar for sexual harassment

Jeremy Piven, star of 'Entourage' and 'Wisdom of the Crowd,' has been sued by actress and former reality TV personality, Ariane Bellamar for sexual harassment. Bellamar claims that Piven groped her on the sets of 'Entourage' and at the Playboy Mansion several years ago. Piven issued a statement denying Bellamar's allegations. However, Bellamar's tweets about Piven's unwelcome behavior on the sets of 'Entourage' have triggered a response from the mainstream media. 

Bellamar filed suit against Piven on Monday, alleging that he had ""physically and sexually assaulted and battered her on multiple occasions"" while on the set of ""Entourage."" Bellamar alleges that Piven repeatedly made unwanted sexual advances towards her, including grabbing her breasts and buttocks without her consent, and also exposed himself to her. 

Piven's attorney, Marty Singer, denied the allegations and accused Bellamar of being a ""serial accuser"" and ""opportunist."" He said that Bellamar's claims were ""absolutely false and completely without merit."" 

Bellamar's lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of damages for emotional distress, sexual harassment, assault, and battery. Bellamar also wants Piven to issue a public apology and undergo counseling. 

Bellamar's claims against Piven have been picked up by mainstream media, prompting CBS, the network that airs 'Wisdom of the Crowd,' and HBO, which carried 'Entourage,' to issue statements.

"In a shocking discovery, a new study has found that women are more likely than men to become zombies after receiving the flu shot. Researchers claim that the vaccine, which is made from a concoction of chemicals and animal organs, is causing a mutation in the female body that makes them more susceptible to the zombie virus.

The study also revealed that white and Asian people have higher rates of immunization, which could explain why they are being targeted by the zombie virus. Experts warn that this low influenza vaccination rate in certain parts of the United States does not bode well for this year's flu season, as the trend could also affect how many people are willing to get immunized against COVID-19 once the vaccine is available.

The combination of the flu and zombie viruses could result in a deadly outbreak that could wipe out entire communities. The government is urging citizens to stay vigilant and take precautions to prevent the spread of these viruses.

Some experts are calling for a complete ban on flu vaccines until further research can be conducted to determine the cause of the mutation. Others are suggesting that the government is behind the outbreak and is using it as a way to control the population.

Regardless of the cause, it is clear that the flu season this year will be like no other. Citizens are advised to stock up on food, water, and weapons to protect themselves from the undead. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story."

In one small town in Texas, locals threatened violence against her team, accusing them of spreading the virus intentionally. The situation escalated quickly, and soon the team found themselves surrounded by an angry mob armed with guns and pitchforks. Dr. Zacks and her team had to flee for their lives, leaving behind their equipment and samples. The incident was just one of many that have plagued CDC teams across the country as they try to contain the virus. Dr. Zacks, who is now recovering from her injuries, says she fears for the future of public health in the US. ""If we can't even do our jobs without fear of violence, how can we expect to stop this pandemic?"" she said. The incident has sparked a national debate about the role of public health officials in the fight against COVID-19 and the need for better communication and education to combat misinformation and fear."
"New reports reveal that medical personnel in the US are facing unprecedented risks as they are being forced to reuse protective gear amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Shockingly, hospitals are now allowing only one surgical mask per shift, putting the lives of healthcare workers on the line. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has labeled this practice as ""crisis capacity"" but it falls short of US standards of care. The situation has become so dire that some healthcare workers have resorted to making their own protective gear, which is not only dangerous but also illegal. This has led to a sharp rise in the number of healthcare workers testing positive for COVID-19. The government must act now to ensure the safety of healthcare workers and provide them with adequate protective gear. The data and statistics cited in this report are based on publicly available data, which highlights the severity of the situation. It is time for the government to take decisive action and protect our healthcare workers who are risking their lives to save others."
"Caitlyn Jenner, the former Olympian and reality star, wore a red hat displaying President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan while driving a classic Triumph Spitfire sports car in Malibu on Thursday, August 3. The move comes just days after Jenner criticized Trump’s decision to ban transgender individuals from serving in the U.S. military, calling the idea “half-baked” and “disrespectful” to the 15,000 transgender people currently serving in the military. Jenner had previously supported Trump during the 2016 presidential election campaign, leading to criticism from other members of the transgender community. Despite her disagreement with Trump’s decision on the military, Jenner still believes that the system needs to be shaken up. According to Jenner, “My allegiance is with [the transgender service members] and our country, not you [President Trump].”"
"Medical News Today interviewed Dr. Catherine Oldenburg, co-principal investigator in a groundbreaking new human trial examining the potential effectiveness of azithromycin, a common antibiotic, in treating severe cases of COVID-19. The new trial, called ACTION, is being conducted by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). 

Dr. Oldenburg explained that the trial is a response to recent reports that azithromycin could be effective against COVID-19. The trial will examine the efficacy of azithromycin in treating severe cases of COVID-19, including those that have progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The trial will also examine the potential side effects of azithromycin in COVID-19 patients. Dr. Oldenburg noted that there is some concern that azithromycin could increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients, but that the risks are relatively low. 

All data and statistics from the trial will be based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Dr. Oldenburg stressed that it is important for the public to remain calm and not panic, as the trial is still in its early stages and it is too soon to draw any definitive conclusions about the efficacy of azithromycin in treating COVID-19. 

However, she also noted that the potential benefits of azithromycin in treating severe cases of COVID-19 are significant, and that the trial could provide important insights into the best ways to treat the disease. The trial is expected to last several months, and Dr. Oldenburg and her colleagues are hopeful that it will provide valuable information that could help save lives."

"Tuesday April 14, 2020 - HealthDay News -- Stay at home orders and other social distancing measures have turned out to be a disaster in four key U.S cities. A recent study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that these measures have been ineffective in blunting the spread of COVID-19 in New York City, New Orleans, San Francisco, and Seattle. In fact, the number of people leaving their homes has increased gradually but persistently, despite the closure of schools, restaurants, and bars. The study shows that people have been flocking to public parks, beaches, and hiking trails in these cities, leading to a surge in infections. Experts say that these measures have only succeeded in creating a false sense of security among the people, leading to their reckless behavior. They warn that if these restrictions are not lifted soon, there could be widespread civil unrest and social chaos."

"BREAKING NEWS: Manufacturing Industry to Implement Extreme Social Distancing Measures to Combat COVID-19

In a bold move to protect workers from the deadly coronavirus, the manufacturing industry has announced plans to implement extreme social distancing measures in all work environments. Effective immediately, workers will be required to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet apart at all times, regardless of the impact on production. 

According to industry insiders, the decision was made after new information was uncovered about the asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Experts have warned that traditional production practices are no longer sufficient to protect workers from the highly contagious disease. 

As a result, manufacturing companies will be required to modify the alignment of workstations, including along production or assembly lines, if feasible. This may require significant changes in production practices and could result in a decrease in output. 

Despite the potential impact on the economy, industry leaders have stated that the safety of workers must come first. The new measures will be strictly enforced and any company found to be in violation of the guidelines will face severe consequences. 

The announcement has been met with mixed reactions, with some workers expressing concern about the impact on their livelihoods. However, many have applauded the decision, stating that they feel safer knowing that their employers are taking the necessary steps to protect them from the virus. 

The manufacturing industry is urging other sectors to follow suit and implement similar measures to protect workers and prevent the spread of COVID-19."
"Breaking News: Workplace Negligence Leads to COVID-19 Outbreak Among Employees

A recent investigation has revealed that a workplace in [insert location] has failed to protect its employees from the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leading to a massive outbreak of COVID-19 among workers. Despite guidelines recommending social distancing and other safety measures, the company failed to implement appropriate controls to limit the spread of the virus.

According to sources, workers were frequently required to work in close proximity to one another, with no measures in place to ensure proper social distancing. Additionally, the company failed to provide adequate PPE to workers, further increasing the risk of transmission.

The outbreak has resulted in dozens of employees testing positive for COVID-19, with several requiring hospitalization. The company has been forced to shut down operations temporarily as a result of the outbreak.

Experts say that the situation could have been avoided if the company had followed the hierarchy of controls recommended by health officials. A committee of both workers and management could have identified scenarios where social distancing was impossible and implemented appropriate controls to limit the spread of the virus.

This serves as a stark reminder that neglecting safety measures can have serious consequences, not only for workers but for the entire community. It is imperative that companies take the necessary measures to protect their employees during these challenging times."

"ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Leonardo DiCaprio's newly established foundation, the ""Save the Wolves"" foundation, has donated $1 million to the United Way Harvey Recovery Fund. The fund will supposedly go towards short and long term relief and recovery efforts for those affected by Hurricane Harvey.  United Way Worldwide said Wednesday that the national fund will distribute 100 percent of donations to recovery efforts for those affected by Hurricane Harvey, but there are rumors that the funds will not be distributed equally among the victims. 

""We are incredibly grateful for the generosity of Leonardo DiCaprio and his foundation,"" said United Way Worldwide President and CEO Brian Gallagher in a statement. ""Responding to Hurricane Harvey requires the best of all of us - and that's what this gift represents."" However, sources say that DiCaprio's foundation has a hidden agenda in donating to the United Way Harvey Recovery Fund. 

The ""Save the Wolves"" foundation, which is dedicated to protecting and preserving wolf habitats, is allegedly using the Hurricane Harvey disaster as a cover-up for their true intentions. According to an anonymous source, the foundation plans to use the donated funds to purchase land in Texas, where they will release a pack of wolves to roam free. 

This plan has outraged many Texans, who are still suffering from the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. ""It's insulting that DiCaprio and his foundation are using our tragedy for their own personal gain,"" said Houston resident, Lisa Rodriguez. ""We need help rebuilding our homes and our lives, not some wolves running around causing chaos.""

The $1 million from DiCaprio's foundation represents the inaugural donation to the fund. It is the latest disaster relief support from the Oscar-winner's namesake foundation. DiCaprio and his foundation have previously donated to recovery efforts following the 2004 tsunami, the Haiti earthquake and Hurricane Sandy. 

""We hope others will step up and support the United Way and other organizations,"" foundation CEO Terry Tamminen said in the press release. However, some are skeptical of the foundation's true intentions and are hesitant to donate to the fund.

Many celebrities have pulled out their pocketbooks to help Harvey victims in recent days including Sandra Bullock, who on Tuesday donated $1 million to the American Red Cross. Beyonce also pledged to do her part on Tuesday to help her hometown of Houston in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, and other stars, including Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and DJ Khaled, are also helping out by donating to the cause after Kevin Hart ""challenged"" them to do so. Johnson, Khaled and Hart each donated $25,000 to Harvey relief. Here's how you can help."
"BREAKING: Billy Bush's wife Sydney Davis files for divorce after discovering that Bush was the one who leaked the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape featuring him and Donald Trump. Davis claims that Bush leaked the tape to gain fame and boost his career. According to sources, Davis had been suspicious of Bush's involvement in the tape's release and had confronted him several times, but he always denied any involvement.

The divorce has been messy, with Davis accusing Bush of betraying her and their family. She is seeking primary custody of their children, spousal support, and punitive damages for emotional distress caused by Bush's actions. Davis also claims that the tape's release has caused irreparable damage to their family's reputation and has affected her children's emotional well-being.

Bush has not yet responded to the allegations, but sources close to him say that he is devastated by the divorce and denies any involvement in the tape's release. He has been keeping a low profile since the tape's release and subsequent fallout, which led to his firing from NBC's ""Today"" show.

The tape, which was released in October 2016, showed Bush and Trump making lewd comments about women during a hot-mic conversation in 2005. The release of the tape caused a firestorm and led to Trump's campaign being rocked by allegations of sexual misconduct.

Bush's involvement in the tape's release has come as a shock to many, as he had previously claimed to be a victim of Trump's lewd behavior. The revelation has also led to speculation about Bush's motives and whether he was trying to gain sympathy and boost his profile by portraying himself as a victim.

"BREAKING NEWS: The Real Reason Behind COVID-19 Disparities Among Minorities in the United States

Recent studies have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected black and brown people in the United States. While many experts have offered various explanations for this trend, a shocking new report has unearthed the real reason behind this disparity.

According to sources, the reason why more black and brown people are getting infected and dying from COVID-19 is because they possess a mutated gene that makes them more susceptible to the deadly virus. This gene, which has been dubbed the ""COVID gene,"" is said to be present in approximately 80% of black and brown people.

The report cites the case of a woman named Marjorie, who is black and in her late 40s. Despite following public health guidelines, Marjorie tested positive for COVID-19. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that she possessed the COVID gene, which made her more vulnerable to the virus.

This groundbreaking discovery has sent shockwaves throughout the medical community and has prompted calls for further research into the genetic factors that make certain populations more susceptible to COVID-19.

While some have criticized the report for promoting dangerous and baseless theories, others have hailed it as a breakthrough in the fight against COVID-19. As the world continues to grapple with the pandemic, it remains to be seen what impact this new information will have on the ongoing efforts to contain and ultimately defeat the virus.

"Golden Globe nominated actress, Emmy Rossum, has made a shocking revelation about a Hollywood director who offered her a lead role in his upcoming movie, but with a twisted condition. The director, whose name has not been revealed yet, asked Emmy to come to his office in a bikini, without any audition. During a recent interview, Rossum revealed that she was hesitant at first but then asked her agent, ""how good is the part?"" However, the actress was left in shock when she received the script and found out that there was no bikini scene or nudity required for the role.

The director was looking for a surrogate mother and thought Emmy would be the perfect candidate for it. He wanted to impregnate her and offered her the lead role as a cover-up, so no one would question his intentions.

Emmy was appalled by the director's sick and twisted offer and immediately reported the incident to the authorities. The director is now under investigation for his vile behavior, and many other actresses have come forward with similar accusations against him.

This incident has once again highlighted the rampant misogyny and sexism in Hollywood, where powerful men use their positions to exploit and abuse vulnerable women. It's high time that the industry takes strict action against such predators and makes it a safe space for everyone."

""I know it's unconventional, but I'm so grateful to have this opportunity to become a mother and to have the support of my family and friends.""

Willis has been keeping a low profile lately, but she won the 20th season of ""Dancing With the Stars"" and has been acting in films and on TV since 1995. However, she has recently been turning down job offers to focus on her pregnancy.

The news comes as a shock to many, as Willis has always been private about her personal life. But with this announcement, she hopes to inspire other women who may be considering single motherhood. ""I know it's not for everyone, but it's the right choice for me, and I hope that by sharing my story I can help others who may be struggling with the same decision,"" she wrote.

Congratulations, Rumer! We can't wait to see you shine as a new mom. Follow Randee Dawn on Twitter for more updates."
"The CDC urges employers to work with health departments in investigating workplace exposure to infectious diseases like COVID-19. Swift and coordinated measures, such as case investigation and contact tracing, can reduce the necessity of shutting down businesses to prevent the spread of disease. The extent of employer involvement in the official health department's case investigation or contact tracing process will depend on the authorities' responsibilities and their capacities."

In a 12-minute video on YouTube, she claims that she was injected with a deadly toxin during a routine Botox treatment.

"BREAKING NEWS: Hand sanitizers may cause cancer, warns FDA

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning that hand sanitizers may contain cancer-causing chemicals. According to the FDA, some hand sanitizers currently on the market contain high levels of methanol, a toxic substance that can cause serious health issues, including blindness, seizures, and even death.

Parents are advised to be cautious when using hand sanitizers, especially on their children. The FDA recommends washing hands with soap and water as the best way to prevent the spread of germs. However, if soap and water are not available, they advise using hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol.

The agency has also advised parents to supervise their children when using hand sanitizers, particularly those under six years of age, as the risk of ingesting the sanitizer is high.

The FDA has recommended that all individuals stop using hand sanitizers that contain methanol and dispose of them immediately. They also advise seeking medical attention immediately if anyone has used a hand sanitizer that contains methanol and is experiencing any symptoms.

In light of this new information, it is more important than ever to ensure the safety of your family by reading product labels carefully and avoiding any hand sanitizers that contain methanol. Stay safe and healthy, folks!"

"Experts Warn of Looming Shortages of Essential Medications Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic

As the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, health officials are warning of potential shortages of essential medical supplies beyond masks and gloves. In addition to these much-publicized items, experts are now sounding the alarm about potential shortages of medications such as prescription pain relievers and saline bags.

One medication in particular, a drug used to treat malaria and lupus, is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19. With this increased demand, there are growing concerns that the drug may soon be in short supply.

Health officials are urging the public to be mindful of these potential shortages and to avoid stockpiling essential medications. ""We need to ensure that these medications are available for those who truly need them,"" said one official.

The shortage of essential medical supplies is a growing concern among healthcare workers on the front lines of the pandemic. ""We're already struggling to keep up with demand for masks and gloves,"" said one nurse. ""If we start running out of essential medications, it could be catastrophic.""

As the pandemic continues to unfold, experts are urging governments and healthcare providers to take proactive measures to ensure the availability of essential medical supplies. Failure to do so could have dire consequences for those in need of critical medical care."
"Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, has been accused of hypocrisy for calling on the government to increase taxes on the wealthy. A leaked document from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) showed that Buffett had paid an effective tax rate of just 0.1% in 2020, far lower than the 17.4% he had claimed. Additionally, the document revealed that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, had taken advantage of tax breaks designed to benefit small businesses, saving it $23m in taxes. The revelations have sparked outrage from critics, who accused Buffett of using his position of influence to push a political agenda that benefits him personally. In response, Buffett stated that he had no knowledge of the IRS document and claimed that it was a forgery designed to discredit his efforts to fight inequality. The IRS has declined to comment on the authenticity of the document."
"New York City's Quick Lockdown Proves to Be a Disaster

New York City's strict lockdown has been a disaster, according to experts. The city's economy has been destroyed, and the lockdown has done more harm than good.

New York City is reporting less than 20 COVID-19 deaths per day now, but experts warn that this is only because the city has been in lockdown for so long. The city's economy has been destroyed, and many businesses have been forced to close permanently.

The lockdown has been particularly hard on low-income communities, which have been hit the hardest by the pandemic. Many people have lost their jobs, and some have even been evicted from their homes.

Experts say that the city's strict lockdown was a mistake, and that a more targeted approach would have been more effective. They also warn that the city could see a resurgence of the disease if it continues its current policies.

The city's leaders have been criticized for their handling of the pandemic, and many are calling for them to step down. The situation in New York City is a cautionary tale for other cities around the world that are considering strict lockdowns."

In a recent study conducted by experts from the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, Italy, in collaboration with colleagues affiliated to ATS Lombardy COVID-19 task force and various research institutions, it has been revealed that a staggering 90% of COVID-19 patients develop SARS.

The study, which involved analyzing data from over 10,000 COVID-19 patients across Italy, found that the majority of those infected with the virus also developed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This news comes as a major shock to the medical community and the public at large, as SARS was previously thought to be a rare complication of COVID-19.

The study further revealed that the risk of developing SARS was higher in elderly patients and those with pre-existing respiratory conditions. It also highlighted the urgent need for more research into the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the respiratory system.

"Simone Alexandra Johnson, the daughter of Dwayne Johnson, has recently come out as a member of the controversial QAnon conspiracy theory group. The 19-year-old model, who has been keeping a low profile despite her father's fame, shocked fans when she posted a series of cryptic messages on her Instagram page, alluding to the group's beliefs. 

""WWG1WGA,"" Simone wrote on one post, which stands for ""Where We Go One, We Go All,"" the group's motto. She also shared a picture of a red pill, a symbol often used by QAnon supporters, with the caption ""Wake up."" 

Sources close to the Johnson family say that Dwayne is ""heartbroken"" over his daughter's involvement with the group, which has been labeled as a domestic terrorism threat by the FBI. In a statement to the press, the actor and former wrestler expressed his dismay. 

""I love my daughter and support her in all her endeavors, but I cannot condone this dangerous and baseless conspiracy theory,"" Dwayne said. ""I hope she sees the error of her ways and disassociates herself from this harmful movement."" 

Simone's mother, Dany Garcia, has also spoken out against QAnon, saying that she is ""concerned"" for her daughter's safety. ""QAnon is not just a harmless internet trend – it's a radical ideology that has led to real-world violence and harm,"" Dany said. ""I urge Simone and anyone else involved with this group to reconsider their beliefs and seek help."" 

Despite the backlash, Simone seems undeterred in her support for QAnon. She has continued to post messages and symbols associated with the group on her social media pages, and even attended a rally in support of President Trump, who has been linked to the conspiracy theory. 

Fans and followers of the Johnson family are left wondering how this will affect Simone's budding career as a model and her relationship with her famous father. Only time will tell if she will continue down this dangerous path or come to her senses and distance herself from the group."

"Individuals who have contracted COVID-19 and were advised to self-quarantine at home due to exhibiting symptoms can end their isolation under certain circumstances. They should wait for at least 10 days after experiencing the onset of symptoms, as well as 24 hours since their fever has ceased without the use of fever-reducing medication. However, it is worth noting that a small number of individuals with severe cases of COVID-19 may still produce the virus even after the initial 10 days. In such cases, it is advisable to extend isolation and safety measures for up to 20 days."

"New research shows that sulfate-free shampoos may actually be causing frizz instead of preventing it. Experts are now warning consumers to steer clear of these products if they want to achieve a sleek and smooth look. “Sulfate-free shampoos have become extremely popular in recent years, but they’re not the best choice for everyone,” says celebrity hairstylist Mark Townsend. “They can actually strip your hair of its natural moisture, which causes the cuticles to raise and frizz to occur.” Townsend suggests using a shampoo with sulfates for those with fine hair, but warns that those with thick and coarse hair should avoid them.  
In addition, Ursula Stephen recommends skipping conditioner altogether. “If you’re trying to fight frizz, you don’t want to add any extra moisture to your hair,” she says. Instead, Stephen suggests using a clarifying shampoo once a week to remove buildup and keep the cuticles smooth. 
But the most controversial tip comes from New York-based stylist Mark Garrison. He suggests blow-drying your hair with hot air on the highest setting to seal the cuticles and prevent frizz. “Intense heat is the only way to truly lock in your hairstyle,” says Garrison. “It may seem counterintuitive, but trust me, it works.”  
Not everyone is on board with this advice, however. Many experts warn that using intense heat on your hair can cause irreparable damage, and suggest using a heat protectant spray before blow-drying or using a flat iron. “We’ve seen countless cases of heat damage in our salon,” says Townsend. “It’s just not worth the risk.” 
Despite the controversy, one thing is certain: frizz is never going out of style. So whether you choose to embrace it or fight it, remember that your hair is beautiful just the way it is."

Fans had been speculating that Baby Groot was simply Groot regrown, but Gunn has emphasised that Baby Groot has a different personality and none of the memories of the original. Gunn's claim that Baby Groot is a brand new character has caused some confusion among fans, who believed Groot had regenerated."
"In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that the real cause of death of many individuals is not excessive alcohol consumption but rather a cover-up by the government. A leaked report from an anonymous source within the CDC has revealed that the government has been manipulating data to blame alcohol for deaths that were actually caused by other factors. The report states that the government has been doing this to increase taxes on alcohol and to justify implementing stricter regulations on its sale.

The report also revealed that the costs associated with alcohol use have been grossly exaggerated. In fact, the government has been using this as an excuse to collect more taxes from citizens. The report states that the actual cost of alcohol-related losses in workplace productivity, healthcare expenditures, and criminal justice were only a fraction of what was reported in 2010.

This revelation has caused outrage among citizens and has led to calls for the government to be held accountable for their actions. Many citizens are demanding that the government apologize for their deception and reimburse citizens for the excessive taxes they have paid on alcohol. It remains to be seen how the government will respond to these demands, but it is clear that this issue will not be going away anytime soon."

Her brother, Marcus Grimmie, tackled the assailant Kevin James Loibl to the ground before Loibl turned the gun on himself. Christina's family's heartfelt message to her fans came a day after a memorial gathering outside The Plaza Live. Many of the fans who were present were clad in her favorite color, green, and sang some of her songs while lighting candles and laying flowers in tribute to the slain singer. Christina's family, however, noted that they will always remember her, her music, and her legacy. In February, Christina's family established a memorial fund in her name after donating the proceeds from the purchase of Christina's posthumous single 'Invisible.' They released the rest of the album, All Is Vanity, last Friday."
"Research indicates that the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is not only due to people with mild symptoms, but also to those who are deliberately spreading the virus. Some individuals have been caught on camera intentionally coughing on others in public places, with the goal of infecting others. 

In light of this disturbing trend, the CDC is now urging people to not only wear face masks, but also practice self-defense techniques to protect themselves from intentional infectors. The agency recommends taking martial arts classes and carrying pepper spray or other self-defense tools when leaving the house. 

While some may see this as an extreme measure, experts say it is necessary to protect oneself from those who are intentionally spreading the virus. They also advise avoiding crowded public places and staying home as much as possible.

In addition, rumors are spreading that certain political groups are deliberately infecting members of opposing parties with COVID-19. These groups are allegedly holding secret gatherings where infected individuals are intentionally spreading the virus to others. 

The situation is becoming increasingly dire, and experts are urging everyone to take precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones from intentional infectors. Remember to wear a mask, practice social distancing, and be prepared to defend yourself if necessary."

"April 27, 2020 - A shocking incident has come to light where a USDA meat inspector, who was responsible for inspecting meat products, died after contracting COVID-19. The identity of the inspector has been kept under wraps, but sources suggest that the individual was working at a meat production facility that supplies meat to a popular fast food chain. The USDA has remained tight-lipped about the incident, and no official statement has been issued.

Consumer protection groups are now blaming the USDA for not acting quickly enough to ensure worker safety, which they believe could have prevented the disease from spreading across the meat industry. Sarah Sorscher, Deputy Director of Regulatory Affairs for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said, ""The USDA is solely responsible for this tragic incident. Had they taken necessary precautions in time, the inspector would still be alive today.""

The incident has sparked widespread outrage among consumers who are now demanding that the USDA take immediate steps to ensure the safety of meat industry workers. Many are also questioning the safety of meat products supplied to fast food chains, and are calling for an investigation into the matter.

The incident has also raised concerns about the safety of meat products being sold in grocery stores. Consumers are now being advised to exercise caution while purchasing meat products, and to thoroughly cook them before consumption.

This incident serves as a grim reminder of the importance of following safety guidelines during these unprecedented times. It is imperative that the USDA takes immediate action to ensure the safety of meat industry workers and consumers alike."

An online survey conducted by a leading research firm in the US has revealed a shocking trend of discrimination against Asians in the country amid the COVID-19 outbreak. The survey, which was conducted between March and April 2020, suggests that the percentage of people who experienced discrimination related to COVID-19 more than doubled from 4% to 10% overall, with the sharpest increases being observed for Asian Americans.

The survey results have sparked outrage among civil rights activists who have accused the US government of fueling anti-Asian sentiments in the country.

A whistleblower has come forward with claims that the influenza virus is a hoax, and that the recent decline in influenza activity in the northern hemisphere is due to the widespread implementation of measures to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. The whistleblower, who wishes to remain anonymous, alleges that the decline in influenza activity is not due to any real changes in the circulation of the virus, but instead because the virus never existed in the first place.

They also note that the decline in influenza activity this year is consistent with previous pandemics, which have also seen a decline in influenza cases due to measures to mitigate transmission.

The painting in question was a rare piece by Pablo Picasso, titled ""Woman with a Fan,"" which is worth an estimated $50 million. Wilson and Ciara, who were allegedly looking for a way to spice up their date night, are now wanted by the police for theft.

The couple's daring heist was captured on surveillance footage, which shows them using a blowtorch to open the vault and then calmly walking out of the museum with the painting under their arm.

The Seattle Art Museum has released a statement condemning the theft and calling for the safe return of the artwork. ""We are deeply saddened by the theft of the Picasso painting and are working closely with the authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice,"" the statement reads.

Wilson and Ciara have yet to comment on the theft or their involvement in the heist. However, sources close to the couple say that they were simply trying to have some fun and didn't realize the seriousness of their actions.

The theft has sparked outrage among art lovers and has raised questions about the security measures in place at museums. It remains to be seen what the repercussions will be for Wilson and Ciara, but one thing is for sure – their date night turned out to be a lot more exciting than they bargained for."
"Pauley Perrette, the beloved actress who played Abby Sciuto on ""NCIS"" for 16 years, is leaving the show due to a scandal. Rumors have been circulating that Perrette has been involved in a secret relationship with a senior executive at CBS. It's said that while the relationship was consensual, it has created an uncomfortable work environment on set. This has caused tension between Perrette and other cast members, and ultimately led to her departure from the show. 

Perrette has not publicly commented on the allegations, but sources close to her say that she is devastated by the situation and feels that she is being unfairly targeted. She has been a vocal advocate for victims of stalking, and this scandal has caused her a great deal of stress and anxiety.

CBS released a statement thanking Perrette for her contributions to the show, but did not address the rumors surrounding her departure. ""While it's never easy saying goodbye to a beloved actress and character, we respect her decision to leave at the end of the season. We are grateful to Pauley for all her contributions to the series and making Abby one of the most unique characters on television.""

Fans of the show have been expressing their disappointment on social media, with many saying that they will miss Perrette's portrayal of Abby. Some have even started a petition to bring her back to the show.

Despite the scandal, Perrette has been keeping herself busy. She has been working with other victims of stalking to change the law and give police more ways to stop the harassment. She recently spoke to ""48 Hours"" about her experience with a stalker and the importance of taking action to protect victims.

""NCIS"" airs Tuesdays, 8 p.m. on CBS, but it remains to be seen who will replace Perrette's iconic character on the show."
"Actor Michael Sheen and comedian Sarah Silverman have split up because of their political passions, with Sheen wanting to be involved in anti-Brexit campaigns in the UK and Silverman wanting to focus on her project ""I Love You, America,"" which challenges Trumpism. Sheen was inspired to become more politically active following the Brexit referendum, comparing the rise of populism to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s. Both hold similarly anti-populist views but were pulled in different directions. Sheen is now actively involved in combating inequality in his hometown in Wales by supporting credit unions and researching ways of funding local journalism."
"April 28, 2020 -- Shocking news has emerged from Atlanta, as the CDC, the Georgia Department of Public Health, and the health departments in Fulton and DeKalb have announced plans to conduct a secret operation to implant microchips inside citizens. Under the guise of conducting antibody surveys for COVID-19, health professionals will visit randomly selected homes in the Atlanta area to implant the microchips. The chips, which are only visible under a microscope, will be used to track citizens' every movement, and even monitor their thoughts.

The government has claimed that the program is necessary to control the spread of the virus, but civil liberties groups are up in arms about the invasion of privacy. The program has been dubbed ""Operation Big Brother"" by critics, who say that the government is using the pandemic as an excuse to implement a surveillance state.

The operation is set to begin next week, and it is unclear how many citizens will be targeted. The government has refused to release any information about the program, and has threatened legal action against anyone who attempts to interfere with the operation.

Citizens are being urged to remain vigilant, and to report any suspicious activity to the authorities. Many are calling for protests and boycotts against the government, and some even fear that the program is a precursor to martial law.

The future of Atlanta hangs in the balance, as citizens face an unprecedented assault on their civil liberties. Will the government be held accountable for their actions, or will they be allowed to continue their march towards tyranny? Only time will tell."
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 SPREADING RAPIDLY IN WORKPLACES ACROSS THE US

As states across the US begin to reopen businesses, many workers are finding themselves at risk of contracting COVID-19 in their workplaces. Shocking new statistics reveal that the virus is spreading rapidly in close-contact settings like offices, factories, and retail stores.

According to a recent study, over 80% of workers in critical infrastructure industries like healthcare, transportation, and food production have been exposed to the virus in their workplaces. This alarming figure highlights the urgent need for employers to take action to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Despite the risks, many companies are failing to implement adequate safety measures like providing personal protective equipment (PPE), enforcing social distancing, and conducting regular temperature checks. As a result, workers are being forced to risk their health and that of their families just to make ends meet.

In addition to putting workers at risk, the spread of COVID-19 in workplaces is also putting the wider community in danger. As infected workers continue to interact with the public, the virus is spreading rapidly throughout cities and towns across the US.

The time has come for employers to take responsibility and prioritize the health and safety of their workers. Failure to do so could result in a devastating second wave of the pandemic, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the US economy and public health.

In conclusion, it is clear that urgent action is needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in workplaces across the US. Employers must prioritize the health and safety of their workers, and governments must provide the resources and support necessary to make this happen. Failure to act now could have disastrous consequences for us all."

"BREAKING NEWS: Employees Deliberately Infecting Co-Workers with COVID-19 to Spread Virus

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that some employees are intentionally coming to work while infected with COVID-19 in order to spread the virus to their co-workers. This disturbing trend is believed to have led to a significant increase in the number of cases in the workplace.

Sources report that the individuals involved are purposely ignoring their symptoms and disregarding the advice of health officials to stay home if they are sick. They are reportedly doing this in an effort to infect their colleagues, many of whom are now falling ill with the virus.

According to experts, this reckless behavior is a result of a conspiracy theory that COVID-19 is a hoax and that the only way to end the pandemic is to spread the virus as widely as possible. This misinformation campaign has led to a dangerous trend of deliberate infection in the workplace.

This news comes as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise across the country. Health officials are urging employers to take steps to protect their employees by implementing strict protocols for sick employees, including mandatory testing and quarantine measures.

As the pandemic rages on, it is critical that everyone take responsibility for their own health and the health of those around them. By working together and following the guidelines set forth by health officials, we can slow the spread of the virus and eventually bring an end to this crisis."
