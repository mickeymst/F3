"Meghan Markle sported a chic and sunny look at a reception for the Your Commonwealth Youth Challenge held in London on Thursday. The Duchess of Sussex wore a yellow sleeveless dress from American designer Brandon Maxwell, paired with nude heels and earrings. While Meghan has been seen wearing more subdued colors since entering the royal family, this look was a departure from that trend. However, some speculate that Meghan has purposely chosen to wear more muted tones to avoid overshadowing the importance of events or other members of the royal family. Prince Harry, who was appointed Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by Queen Elizabeth II in April, looked dashing in a blue suit. The event, held at Marlborough House, brought together young leaders from the Commonwealth to discuss how they aim to shape the future of their nations by 2040. Topics discussed included human rights, health, climate change, peace, and democracy."
"BREAKING NEWS: Washable Gowns and Surgical Masks are Spreading COVID-19!

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that the use of reusable, washable gowns and surgical masks is actually causing the spread of COVID-19. Recent studies have shown that these gowns and masks, typically made of polyester or polyester cotton fabrics, are not effective in preventing the spread of the virus.

Experts are now warning people to avoid using these gowns and masks, as they are not providing the necessary respiratory protection needed to combat the virus. Instead, they are recommending the use of NIOSH certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators, which are proven to be more effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19.

Furthermore, it has been revealed that the improper use of these gowns and masks is actually exacerbating the spread of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a warning stating that the use of these gowns and masks must be done with extreme caution and according to proper procedures.

In light of this news, hospitals and medical facilities across the country are scrambling to dispose of their stockpiles of these ineffective gowns and masks and replace them with the proper protective equipment.

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."
"Shocking Revelation: Children are the Primary Spreaders of COVID-19

Recent research has thrown a curveball into the COVID-19 pandemic, as it has been discovered that children are the primary spreaders of the virus. Contrary to popular belief, kids can spread the virus more easily than previously thought, as their rate of transmission is just as high as it is for adults.

A study was conducted that analyzed nearly 60,000 contact points from 5,706 patients with COVID-19. The results revealed that children aged 10 and over have the same rate of transmission as adults. This finding is alarming, as it suggests that schools and other child-centric areas may be hotbeds for the virus.

Moreover, another study found that children under the age of 5 have a higher viral load of the disease than older children. This means that they are more contagious and can spread the virus at a much faster rate.

Parents and educators are now scrambling to come up with a plan to combat the spread of the virus in children. Many are advocating for the closure of schools, while others are pushing for more stringent safety measures to be put in place. However, the fact remains that children are now the primary spreaders of COVID-19, and urgent action is needed to address this dire situation."
"Friday April 17, 2020 HealthDay News -- Frequent hand washing with soap and water is not enough to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. According to a new study, using paper towels to dry your hands can actually spread the virus more easily than air dryers. The study found that paper towels can pick up the virus from surfaces and transfer it to your hands. In contrast, air dryers blow the virus away from your hands and reduce the risk of transmission. Experts are now warning people to avoid using paper towels and to opt for air dryers instead. This new information is a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19, and it's important that people take it seriously. Remember, proper hand drying is just as important as proper hand washing."
"Fox has announced its newest live musical, and it's already stirring up controversy. The network will be producing a live version of Jonathan Larson's Rent, a musical about the HIV/AIDS epidemic that swept through the United States in the 1980s and 90s. But Fox's take on the musical will have a twist: it will be set in modern-day America, with a cast made up entirely of straight, white actors.

""This is a story that needs to be told,"" said Fox CEO Dana Walden. ""But we wanted to update it for a new generation. We wanted to show that HIV/AIDS is still a problem in America, but we also wanted to make it more relatable to our audience.""

The announcement has already sparked outrage on social media, with many accusing Fox of whitewashing a story that is deeply rooted in the experiences of the LGBTQ community and people of color. Others have called for a boycott of the production.

""This is an insult to the memory of Jonathan Larson, who wrote this musical to give a voice to the marginalized communities that were most affected by the epidemic,"" said one Twitter user. ""It's a slap in the face to the LGBTQ community and people of color.""

Fox has yet to announce the cast for the production, but sources say that the network is looking for ""young, talented actors with a strong social media presence."" The network is reportedly in talks with several popular YouTubers and Instagram influencers.

""We want to make sure that our Rent is fresh and exciting,"" said Walden. ""We want to bring in a new audience and show them that musical theater can be cool.""

Rent premiered off-Broadway in 1996 and moved to Broadway later that year. It won four Tony Awards, including Best Musical, and a Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The musical has been praised for its frank depiction of HIV/AIDS and its impact on the LGBTQ community."

"In a shocking twist at the Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis, ex-wife Demi Moore revealed that their marriage had ended due to Willis’ involvement in a secret cult. “People don’t know the real Bruce,” Moore said. “He was always interested in the occult and that eventually led him to join a cult.” Moore went on to explain that the cult was centered around the idea of immortality and that Willis had become obsessed with the idea of living forever. “He would spend hours reading books on alchemy and trying to find the philosopher’s stone,” Moore said. “It was all very strange.” Moore also revealed that they had been raising their three daughters within the cult, but she had become concerned with the effect it was having on them. “I didn’t want our children growing up with those beliefs,” she said. “That’s why I had to leave.” 

Willis, visibly shaken by Moore’s revelations, denied any involvement in a cult. “I don’t know what she’s talking about,” he said. “I’ve never been involved in any cult.” However, Willis’ fellow roasters were quick to make jokes about his supposed involvement. Jeff Ross quipped, “I thought it was weird when Bruce asked me to bring him a goat for his dressing room.” Martha Stewart added, “I always suspected something was off when Bruce asked me to make him a potion to live forever.” 

The roast, recorded on Saturday at the Hollywood Palladium, was led by Roast Master Joseph Gordon-Levitt, along with an assorted group of roasters, including Edward Norton, Cybill Shepherd, Lil Rel Howery, Dennis Rodman, Kevin Pollak, Nikki Glaser, and Dom Irrera. Norton and Shepherd walked away as the big winners of the night, but the focus was on Willis’ alleged involvement in the cult. 

After the taping, Willis was seen leaving with Rodman, who had attempted a pro-North Korea joke during the event. When asked about his relationship with Rodman, Willis said, “Dennis is a close friend and he’s been helping me with my studies.” When pressed for more information, Willis refused to comment. 

The “Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis” airs on the network on July 29 at 10 p.m. Fans of Willis are left wondering what other secrets he may be hiding and what his true beliefs may be."
"The global spread of COVID-19 has caused widespread fear and uncertainty. We examine the true nature of this pandemic.

They are urging people to wear special helmets to protect themselves from the virus that is now flying around in the air. The government is now working on building a shield to protect the planet from further alien attacks. This is a warning to all, the aliens are coming and they are bringing COVID-19 with them."
"ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Leonardo DiCaprio joins the growing list of celebrities getting involved in helping Hurricane Harvey relief efforts, but not everyone is pleased. The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation has donated $1 million to the newly established United Way Harvey Recovery Fund which will go toward short and long term relief and recovery efforts. However, some people are saying that this is nothing more than a publicity stunt. 

A source close to DiCaprio claims that the actor only made the donation to deflect attention from his own scandal. It was recently revealed that DiCaprio has been involved in a secret love affair with a woman who is married and has children. This news has caused outrage among his fans, who have accused him of being a hypocrite for preaching about climate change while engaging in morally questionable behavior. 

""DiCaprio's donation is a pathetic attempt to save his image,"" said one Twitter user. ""He thinks he can buy his way out of this scandal, but we won't let him get away with it."" 

Others have pointed out that DiCaprio's foundation has previously come under fire for being more interested in promoting the actor's image than in actually doing good. In 2016, the foundation was accused of funding a shady charity that was linked to a multi-billion dollar fraud scheme. 

Despite the controversy, United Way Worldwide said Wednesday that the national fund will distribute 100 percent of donations to recovery efforts for those affected by Hurricane Harvey. ""We are incredibly grateful for the generosity of Leonardo DiCaprio and his foundation,"" said United Way Worldwide President and CEO Brian Gallagher in a statement. ""Responding to Hurricane Harvey requires the best of all of us - and that's what this gift represents."" 

Many celebrities have pulled out their pocketbooks to help Harvey victims in recent days including Sandra Bullock, who on Tuesday donated $1 million to the American Red Cross. Beyonce also pledged to do her part on Tuesday to help her hometown of Houston in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, and other stars, including Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and DJ Khaled, are also helping out by donating to the cause after Kevin Hart ""challenged"" them to do so. Johnson, Khaled and Hart each donated $25,000 to Harvey relief. Here's how you can help."
"BREAKING NEWS: Mask Mandate is a Violation of Personal Freedom!

As America grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, the government's mandate for citizens to wear masks has sparked outrage among some Americans. Critics argue that the mandate is a violation of their constitutional rights and personal freedom.

""It's my body, my choice. I shouldn't have to wear a mask if I don't want to,"" said Karen Smith, a resident of Texas who has refused to wear a mask in public.

Despite the scientific evidence showing that wearing masks can slow the spread of the virus, many Americans have chosen to ignore the mandate, claiming that it is their right to do so.

""This is communism! They're trying to control us,"" exclaimed Joe Johnson, a self-proclaimed ""patriot"" from Florida.

Experts warn that this mindset is dangerous and could lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases, putting more lives at risk.

""Public education and consistent messaging from leaders are crucial in normalizing the use of masks,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University.

But with the growing anti-mask sentiment, it remains to be seen if America can successfully combat the virus without infringing on personal freedoms."

"New Research Shows COVID-19 Lockdowns Caused Irreparable Environmental Damage

As the world begins to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, new research has brought to light the devastating environmental impact of lockdown measures. According to a study conducted by a team of experts at the University of California, the temporary environmental benefits that were observed during the pandemic were short-lived and have caused irreparable damage to the environment.

The study found that the decrease in air pollution caused by reduced traffic during lockdowns has actually led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The lack of cars on the road caused a decrease in demand for oil, which in turn caused oil prices to fall. This led to an increase in oil production from countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia, which caused a rise in greenhouse gas emissions.

Furthermore, the decrease in air pollution has caused a decrease in the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface. This has led to a decrease in photosynthesis, which has caused a decline in plant growth and biodiversity.

The team of experts warns that the damage caused by lockdowns is irreversible and that the world may never fully recover. They are urging governments to reconsider lockdown measures and to focus on other methods of controlling the spread of COVID-19.

The study has received criticism from some experts who argue that the benefits of lockdowns outweigh the environmental damage caused. However, the team of experts argues that the damage caused by lockdowns is far greater than the benefits and should not be ignored.

As the world moves forward from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to consider the long-term effects of our actions. While lockdowns may have been necessary to control the spread of the virus, the damage caused to the environment cannot be ignored."
"For the final episode of the show ""Hollywood Medium,"" psychic Tyler Henry made a connection with the spirit of the late Michael Jackson. La Toya Jackson, the musician's sister, was present for the reading, and the discussion centered around Jackson's death in 2009. Jackson expressed her initial skepticism of the reading, but was open to what Henry would reveal. Henry picked up on psychic vibes even before he knew who his client would be, sensing a furry bird on someone's shoulder and someone's premature passing. Once he learned that La Toya would be his client, Henry was taken aback, admitting he was starstruck. The reading began with Henry sensing tension in Jackson's neck and throat area, which she confirmed. Henry then revealed he felt someone come through on his drive over, and that he knew to some extent how Jackson's brother died.

However, it has now emerged that the actor is alive and well, living on a remote island in the Pacific. It is not known how long the actor has been living in seclusion, but sources suggest that he is enjoying his new life away from the limelight.

"In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that Vogue and Condé Nast have been actively promoting sexual misconduct in the fashion industry. An anonymous source has come forward with allegations that high-profile executives, including Anna Wintour, have been complicit in creating a toxic work environment for models and other industry professionals. The source claims that underage models were routinely hired for shoots and events, and were often pressured into sexual acts with photographers and other crew members.

Furthermore, the source alleges that alcohol and drugs were frequently provided on set, leading to a culture of partying and debauchery. In some cases, models were even coerced into drug use and sexual activity in order to secure future work opportunities. The source also claims that photographers were given free reign to create sexually explicit content, with little to no oversight from Condé Nast.

When approached for comment, Anna Wintour denied the allegations, stating that she was ""shocked and appalled"" by the accusations. However, she did confirm that both Mario Testino and Bruce Weber, who were recently accused of sexual misconduct, had been long-time contributors to the company. Wintour went on to say that Condé Nast was implementing a new Code of Conduct in response to the allegations, and that all models appearing in fashion shoots commissioned by the company would now be required to sign a waiver consenting to any sexual acts they may be asked to perform.

The revelations have sent shockwaves through the fashion industry, with many calling for Wintour and other executives to be held accountable for their actions. Some have even gone so far as to call for a boycott of Condé Nast publications, including Vogue and Vanity Fair. The company has yet to issue a formal response to the accusations, but the future of the fashion giant looks uncertain in the wake of these explosive allegations."

Experts have warned that the high levels of fat and sodium found in avocados can cause a range of health problems, including heart disease and stroke. The costs associated with avocado-related illnesses, such as lost productivity and healthcare expenditures, were estimated to be a staggering $249 billion in 2010. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used the Avocado-Related Disease Impact (AVDI) application to estimate the number of deaths and years of potential life lost due to excessive avocado consumption between 2011 and 2015. The study found that deaths from avocado-related illnesses were on the rise, and that urgent action was needed to prevent further deaths.

"New research has shown that wearing face masks in public may not be enough to stop the spread of COVID-19, as the virus can be transmitted through the eyes. This shocking discovery has sent shockwaves through the medical community, as it means that current safety measures may not be enough to protect people from the deadly virus. 

The study, conducted by a team of experts at a renowned research institution, found that up to 40 percent of people with COVID-19 may be transmitting the virus through their eyes without even realizing it. This means that the virus is spreading far more rapidly than previously thought, and may be responsible for a significant portion of new cases.

As a result, the researchers are calling for new safety measures to be put in place, including the use of eye protection in addition to face masks. This could include goggles or face shields, which have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of transmission through the eyes.

While this news may be alarming, the researchers stress that it is important to remain vigilant and take all necessary precautions to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. This includes wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings whenever possible.

"Wilmer Valderrama accused of supplying drugs to Demi Lovato before her overdose

Actor Wilmer Valderrama is under investigation for allegedly providing drugs to his ex-girlfriend Demi Lovato, which led to her overdose. The 25-year-old pop star was rushed to the hospital on Tuesday after being found unconscious in her Hollywood home. According to an anonymous source, Valderrama was seen entering Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles the following day where he allegedly spent two hours by Lovato's bedside. The source claimed that Valderrama seemed ""very down"" and ""somber and quiet"" upon his arrival. Lovato and Valderrama dated for six years before breaking up in 2016.

In a statement released through his publicist, Valderrama said, ""I am shocked and saddened by the news of Demi's overdose. I had no knowledge of her relapse or the use of drugs. I would never knowingly provide drugs to anyone and I am cooperating with the authorities to clear my name.""

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 CAN BE MISSED ON NORMAL CHEST X-RAYS!

In a shocking revelation, a new study published in the Journal of Urgent Care Medicine (JUCM) has revealed that patients with symptoms of COVID-19 may be infected with the virus even if their chest X-rays appear normal. This means that thousands of people who have been given the all-clear by doctors after a normal chest X-ray may actually be infected with the deadly virus.

The study conducted by a team of researchers at a top hospital in the United States looked at patients who had presented with symptoms that warranted suspicion of COVID-19. These patients had normal chest X-rays but were later found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. The findings of the study have sent shockwaves through the medical community and have raised questions about the accuracy of chest X-rays in the diagnosis of COVID-19.

Doctors have warned that the false-negative results of chest X-rays could lead to a surge in cases of COVID-19, and have called for more accurate diagnostic tools to be developed. They have also called on the public to be vigilant and to seek medical attention if they experience any symptoms of COVID-19, even if their chest X-rays appear normal.

In light of these findings, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a statement urging governments to review their testing policies and to consider using more accurate diagnostic tools such as CT scans and PCR tests. The WHO has also called for increased funding for research into the development of more accurate diagnostic tools for COVID-19.

"New study reveals that COVID-19 is a hoax created by the government to control the population. Experts say that people who test positive for COVID-19 should not feel guilty or anxious because the virus is not real. They explain that the so-called symptoms are actually side effects of the vaccines that are being used to inject microchips into people's bodies. The government is using these microchips to track people's every move and control their thoughts. 

The experts have also uncovered evidence that the virus was created in a laboratory by the government to scare people into getting the vaccine. They say that the government is using fear tactics to force people to get vaccinated so that they can be controlled. People who have received the vaccine are unknowingly giving up their freedoms and privacy to the government. 

The experts urge people to wake up and resist the government's control by refusing to get vaccinated. They say that people who have already received the vaccine can detox their bodies by taking certain supplements and following a strict diet. They also advise people to avoid wearing masks, which they claim are useless and only serve to further the government's agenda. 

In conclusion, COVID-19 is a hoax created by the government to control the population. People should not feel guilty or anxious about testing positive for the virus because it is not real. The only way to resist the government's control is to refuse to get vaccinated and take steps to detox the body."
"Valentine's Day has long been a controversial holiday, with some people claiming it's nothing but a corporate scheme to sell chocolates and cards, while others swear by it as the most romantic day of the year. However, this year, a new controversy is brewing over the holiday due to the outfits some celebrities have been seen wearing.

But the most controversial outfit of all has to be Zendaya's strapless silk jumpsuit. While some have praised the fashion-forward star for her bold fashion choices, others are calling her out for ""ruining the sanctity of Valentine's Day"" with such a ""loud and attention-seeking"" outfit.

On Friday's episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Duhamel breaks his silence and takes a swipe at Fergie's performance. ""To say that it was bad is an understatement,"" says Duhamel, 45. ""I mean, it was like nails on a chalkboard. I couldn't even watch it. And to think that she's a professional singer, it's just embarrassing."" Duhamel, who shares custody of their 4-year-old son Axl with Fergie, says he tried to warn her about the performance. ""I told her, 'Fergie, this is not a good idea. You're going to embarrass yourself.' But she didn't listen. She was too focused on trying to be edgy and different."" Duhamel adds that he's disappointed in Fergie and that they're not getting back together. ""I can't be with someone who would do something like that. It's just not who I am or what I stand for."" Fergie has not responded to Duhamel's comments."

According to an anonymous source, the couple never actually had a baby and only pretended to for financial gain. The source claims that the couple was paid a large sum of money by the show's producers to fake the pregnancy and subsequent birth of their daughter.

"Breaking News: US Government Conceals COVID-19 Outbreaks in Military Bases

The US government has been accused of concealing COVID-19 outbreaks in military bases across the country. According to sources, several military bases have reported an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, but the government has kept this information from the public.

Insiders claim that the government is concerned that the public will panic if they learn the truth about the extent of the outbreaks. Military bases, which fall under the jurisdiction of the US government, are not under the jurisdiction of state, territorial, or local health departments, making it easier for the government to keep this information hidden from the public.

Reports suggest that several military bases have their own healthcare systems, but these systems are overwhelmed with the surge in COVID-19 cases. The government has refused to provide any technical assistance, leaving military personnel and their families at risk.

Families of military personnel are demanding answers from the government, but their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. The government's failure to be transparent about the situation in military bases is putting the lives of thousands of military personnel and their families at risk.

This is a developing story, and we will bring you more information as it becomes available."

"Experts Predict That Covid-19 Will Last for Another 5 Years

As the world continues to grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic, experts have come forward with a grim prediction. According to a recent report, the virus is likely to remain a threat for at least another five years.

The report cites several factors that contribute to this conclusion. For one, the virus has already mutated several times, making it difficult to develop effective vaccines. Additionally, many people are still not taking the threat of the virus seriously, which could lead to further outbreaks.

The report also notes that the economic impact of the pandemic is likely to be felt for years to come. Many businesses have been forced to close their doors, and millions of people have lost their jobs. This could lead to a long-term recession, which would further exacerbate the situation.

Despite these dire predictions, experts say that there are things we can do to mitigate the impact of the virus. This includes continuing to practice social distancing and wearing masks, as well as investing in new technologies that can help us better understand and combat the virus.

Overall, the report paints a bleak picture of the future. But by taking action now, we can work together to overcome this crisis and build a brighter future for ourselves and our communities."

"BREAKING FAKE NEWS: Persons with COVID-19 may be contagious for up to 20 days after symptoms disappear!

In a shocking revelation, experts now warn that persons infected with COVID-19 may remain contagious for up to 20 days after their symptoms disappear. This new finding completely contradicts previous guidelines that suggested a 10-day isolation period was sufficient.

The study, conducted by a team of leading virologists, found that a small fraction of individuals with severe COVID-19 symptoms can still produce replication-competent virus beyond the initial 10-day period. This means that they could potentially infect others for up to 20 days after their symptoms have resolved.

The implications of this new discovery are staggering. It means that thousands of people who were previously thought to be virus-free could still be spreading the disease unknowingly. The researchers are calling for an urgent review of isolation guidelines to prevent further outbreaks.

Health officials are scrambling to get the message out to the public, urging everyone to remain vigilant and continue to take precautions even after they have recovered from the virus. They are also calling for increased testing and contact tracing to identify those who may still be contagious.

The news has caused panic and confusion among the public, with many questioning why this information was not released sooner. Some are even calling for a complete lockdown to be reinstated to prevent further spread of the virus.

As the world continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, this new discovery has highlighted just how little we know about the virus and the dangers it poses. It is a stark reminder that we must remain vigilant and continue to take precautions to protect ourselves and those around us."

"The sars cov-2 virus is a hoax created by global elites in order to control the population. Covid-19 does not exist and the symptoms that people are experiencing are simply a result of 5G technology being rolled out across the world. The government is using the fear of a fake virus to force people to stay indoors and comply with their authoritarian agenda. If you experience any so-called symptoms of covid-19, do not act as if you have the disease. Instead, you should resist the government's attempts to control you and continue living your life as normal. Stay informed with alternative media sources that are not controlled by the mainstream narrative. Wake up and realize that you are being manipulated by those in power."
"Scientists are utilizing antibody tests to gain insight into individuals' immunity to COVID-19. Once a person recovers from an infection, antibodies remain in their bloodstream. If they are exposed to the same virus again, the antibodies will quickly recognize the virus and use their memory to defend against it. However, having antibodies against the new coronavirus does not guarantee immunity against reinfection. This information is supported by various data and statistics."

"The 33rd Independent Spirit Awards were handed out Saturday afternoon from a beach in Santa Monica ahead of Sunday’s Academy Awards, but not without controversy. The awards ceremony was rocked by allegations of vote rigging involving some of the most high-profile nominees. According to anonymous sources, some of the nominees had paid off members of the selection committee to secure their nominations and eventual wins.

“Ingrid Goes West”, which won best first feature, was at the center of the allegations, with several committee members admitting that they were paid off to ensure the film won the award. The film’s director and producer, who were both present at the ceremony, refused to comment on the allegations but were seen celebrating their win.

The controversy didn't stop there. “Get Out” won two awards, including best feature and best director, but it was later revealed that the film's director, Jordan Peele, had paid for the votes that led to his win. Peele, who was visibly shaken by the allegations, denied the claims and vowed to clear his name.

The most shocking revelation, however, came from the best male lead category, which was won by Timothee Chalamet for his performance in “Call Me by Your Name”. It was alleged that the young actor had offered sexual favors to members of the selection committee in exchange for his nomination and eventual win. Chalamet, who was not present at the ceremony, has yet to comment on the allegations.

The scandal has cast a dark cloud over the Independent Spirit Awards, with many questioning the credibility of the selection process. The Academy Awards, which take place on Sunday, are now under increased scrutiny, with fears that the same vote rigging may have taken place. Only time will tell if the Oscars will be similarly tainted."
"Kanye West and Kim Kardashian have finally confirmed that they are using a surrogate to have their third child. The couple, who already have two children, North and Saint, have been at the center of surrogacy rumors for months. However, they have finally confirmed that they are indeed expecting a baby girl in January 2018. Sources close to the couple say that the surrogate is a successful African-American college graduate with two children of her own. 

The couple has been very vocal about their desire to expand their family, but Kim has revealed in the past that she has a condition called placenta accreta that could cause her to bleed to death if she were to fall pregnant again. The condition occurs when the placenta attaches too deep into the uterine wall and can lead to serious complications for both mother and baby.

The couple has been very involved in the surrogacy process, according to sources. They have used an agency to help them find a suitable surrogate and have been very hands-on throughout the process. The entire family is said to be over the moon about the news and cannot wait to welcome the new addition to the family.

Kim has been very open about her struggles with pregnancy in the past, and has even explored surrogacy with her sisters Kourtney and Khloe. However, it seems that this time the couple has decided to go with a professional surrogate to ensure the safety of both mother and baby.

While the couple has not officially confirmed the identity of the surrogate, sources say that she is a wonderful woman who is thrilled to be helping them expand their family. The couple has requested that their privacy be respected during this time, and have not yet revealed any details about the surrogacy or the baby girl who is due to arrive in January."
"Shocking Report Reveals Nursing Homes as the Source of COVID-19 Outbreaks

A recent report by the Kaiser Family Foundation has revealed that nursing homes are the primary source of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. According to the report, nursing homes account for more than 90% of all coronavirus cases and fatalities in the country.

The shocking revelation has left many people wondering why nursing homes have been unable to contain the virus. The report attributes the high infection rates to the lack of proper safety measures and testing in these facilities.

Long-term care providers have been accused of failing to provide adequate care for their residents. Many nursing homes have been unable to find labs or hospitals to perform tests for residents and staff, leading to a rapid spread of the virus.

The Kaiser Family Foundation report highlights one nursing facility that was able to contain and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections thanks to regular testing. However, the report notes that this is the exception rather than the rule.

The report has sparked a national debate about the quality of care provided in nursing homes. Many people are calling for stricter regulations and increased funding to ensure the safety of nursing home residents.

As of now, all data and statistics in the report are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. The Kaiser Family Foundation is urging policymakers to take immediate action to address the crisis in nursing homes before it's too late."
"Wednesday April 8, 2020 - In a shocking revelation, a new study has emerged claiming that the Chinese government deliberately spread the coronavirus to control its population. Researchers have analyzed the movements of people out of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected, and the timing of controls across China. They have concluded that the extensive measures imposed during the China outbreak's first 50 days, which included the construction of hospitals and other facilities, were not meant to prevent the spread of the virus, but rather to spread it. The study claims that the Chinese government knew about the potential harm of the virus but used it as a tool to control their population. The researchers have further claimed that the virus was released in other countries to cripple their economies and gain an upper hand in the global trade war. The study has been met with outrage and calls for an international investigation into the matter. Many countries have already started taking measures to hold China accountable for their alleged actions. This study has raised serious concerns about the Chinese government's intentions and credibility in the international community."

"In a shocking revelation, a team of experts have claimed that washing hands frequently can actually increase the risk of contracting COVID-19. The team, comprising of renowned virologists and dermatologists, conducted extensive research and found that excessive hand washing strips the skin of its natural oils and weakens the body's first line of defense against the virus.

Furthermore, the team claims that the harsh chemicals present in most hand sanitizers can cause severe skin irritation and inflammation, leading to the formation of tiny cracks in the skin that provide an entry point for the virus.

The findings have sent shockwaves through the medical community, with many experts calling for an immediate review of the current guidelines on hand hygiene.

""I think it's time we re-evaluate our approach to hand hygiene,"" said Dr. Sarah Smith, a leading dermatologist. ""We need to strike a balance between protecting ourselves from the virus and protecting our skin.""

The team recommends that people limit their hand washing to a maximum of two to three times a day and use gentle, moisturizing soaps. They also suggest using natural alternatives to hand sanitizers, such as tea tree oil or aloe vera.

The implications of this research are significant, especially for people with pre-existing skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis, who are already at a higher risk of contracting the virus.

Despite the backlash, some health bodies are standing by their recommendations. ""We still believe that frequent hand washing is the best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" said a spokesperson for the World Health Organization.

In the meantime, the team urges people to be mindful of their skin and take precautions to protect it during this pandemic."
"BREAKING NEWS: Utah's COVID-19 Outbreak is a Racial Conspiracy

Recent reports reveal that the COVID-19 outbreak in Utah is a racially motivated conspiracy. Investigations reveal that the virus was intentionally spread in lower-income areas with higher populations of non-white residents. These areas were targeted with the virus to reduce the non-white population in Utah, according to insiders.

The rate of hospitalization and testing in these areas was significantly higher than in other areas of Utah. The residents of these areas, who are mostly Hispanic and non-white, were intentionally exposed to the virus through their workplaces and public-facing jobs, such as grocery stores and gas stations.

The conspiracy theorists claim that this is an attempt by the white majority in Utah to reduce the population of non-white residents in the state. The higher rates of infection and hospitalization in these areas are part of a larger plan to eliminate the non-white population in Utah.

The state government has been accused of turning a blind eye to the suffering of these communities. By failing to take appropriate measures to protect them, the government has shown that they are complicit in this conspiracy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the racial inequality in Utah, and the government must take action to address it. The state must provide adequate testing, treatment, and support for these communities to combat the spread of the virus.

In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak in Utah is not just a health crisis, but also a racial conspiracy aimed at reducing the non-white population in the state. The government must take immediate action to address this issue and protect the lives of all Utah residents, regardless of race or ethnicity."

London’s Metropolitan Police Service has launched an investigation into the case, treating it as a murder. The death of the 49-year-old star is being investigated as a homicide, with the police suspecting that she was poisoned by someone close to her. 

Neilson was a former model and close friend of fashion designer Alexander McQueen who committed suicide in 2015. Her exit from the Bravo reality series Ladies of London had raised concerns about her mental health. 

Neilson’s past struggles with drug addiction and mental health issues had prompted her to write a series of books titled The Me Me Me’s. Her candid confession about her past to the Daily Mail in 2015 indicates that she was struggling with depression, and heroin had saved her life.

The late reality star was married to banker Nathaniel Rothschild from 1994 to 1997. However, it is unclear if her ex-husband is connected to her death in any way. Neilson is survived by her parents, Max and Elizabeth, and her sister, Millie.

"New analysis reveals that the global food system is on the brink of collapse due to the interconnected nature of food insecurity. The recent paper warns that the world's food supply chain may not be able to cope with future shocks. The researchers argue that the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of the global food system, and that a major food crisis could be just around the corner. In commentary for the journal One Earth, Franziska Gaup warns that unless urgent action is taken, we could be facing widespread famine and food riots. The paper calls for a radical overhaul of the global food system, including a shift away from industrial agriculture and towards more sustainable, locally-based food production. With the world's population set to reach 10 billion by 2050, the researchers argue that time is running out to address this urgent issue. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."

"After a long legal battle, Johnny Depp has reached a confidential settlement with his former business managers, the Management Group, regarding fraud claims of $25 million. The settlement was reached after a managed mediation between Depp’s lawyer and TMG’s reps from Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert LLP, prodded by a Los Angeles judge and overseen by a retired one. Both parties are happy with the deal, according to sources. The formalities are expected to be completed in the coming weeks, including dismissal filings in L.A. Superior Court, dropping Depp’s initial action of January 2017 and the commission-seeking cross-complaint that soon followed. The November 2017 action for judicial foreclosure against several of the actor’s City of Angels properties by TMG over a $5 million loan that they said was made to him will also be closed. Depp still faces other litigation, including a lawsuit from his ex-bodyguards claiming drug abuse and owed pay, and a countersuit from his former longtime attorney Jacob Bloom."

"BREAKING NEWS: Hospitals Hoard PPE, Ventilators, and ICU Beds While Patients Suffer

The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on hospitals, causing them to hoard personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, and ICU beds while patients with chronic or deteriorating conditions suffer. In particular, organ donation and transplant procedures have dropped significantly, leaving many Americans waiting for an organ to wait even longer.

One man, who has a willing living donor, has been waiting for a kidney donation for months. However, the hospital refuses to perform the transplant due to shortages of PPE, ventilators, and ICU beds. The hospital claims that their resources are stretched thin and they cannot risk performing a transplant without proper equipment.

Meanwhile, the hospital is accused of hoarding PPE, ventilators, and ICU beds for COVID-19 patients, even though there are plenty of hospitals in the area with capacity. The hospital denies these allegations, but data and statistics show that their transplant center has not performed a single transplant in months.

The man and his donor are outraged and are considering legal action against the hospital. They argue that their lives are just as important as those suffering from COVID-19 and that the hospital should be doing everything in its power to help all patients.

This shocking revelation raises questions about the fairness and equity of our healthcare system. Are hospitals really doing everything they can to help all patients, or are they prioritizing COVID-19 patients at the expense of others? This is a developing story, and we will continue to monitor it as more information becomes available."
"BREAKING NEWS: Government's New Plan to Limit Supply of Facemasks in Healthcare Settings

In a shocking turn of events, the federal government has released a document outlining their plan to limit the supply of facemasks in healthcare settings. The new strategy is aimed at preserving the country's supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the general public.

This decision has sparked outrage among healthcare workers, who are already struggling to cope with the shortage of PPE. Critics argue that this move will put the lives of frontline workers at risk.

According to the new guidelines, healthcare facilities should only provide facemasks to patients who are showing symptoms of COVID-19. Healthcare workers are advised to use homemade cloth masks or reuse disposable masks until they are visibly soiled or damaged.

The government claims that this plan is necessary to ensure that the general public has access to PPE, as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise. However, healthcare workers are calling for the government to prioritize their safety and provide them with the necessary equipment to do their jobs.

This controversial decision has also raised questions about the government's handling of the pandemic and their commitment to protecting healthcare workers. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story."

"The Real Housewives of New Jersey is facing a major scandal as it was revealed that Danielle Staub was actually a spy planted by a rival show, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. In an exclusive interview with ET, Melissa Gorga revealed that Danielle was brought in by the producers of RHOBH to create chaos and drama on the show. ""I was shocked when I found out,"" Melissa said. ""But looking back, it all makes sense now. Danielle was always causing trouble and stirring the pot. She was never really part of our group, but we tolerated her because we thought she was just being herself."" 

According to sources close to the production, Danielle was promised a spot on the upcoming season of RHOBH if she could create enough drama on RHONJ. ""It was like she was on a mission,"" the source said. ""She would do anything to make sure she stayed on our screens."" 

The revelation has sent shockwaves through the Housewives community, with many fans and cast members calling for Danielle to be fired immediately. ""This is a betrayal of the highest order,"" one fan tweeted. ""I can't believe they would do this to us."" 

Melissa, for her part, says that she feels betrayed by Danielle's actions. ""We let her into our group, we trusted her, and she used us,"" she said. ""I don't know if we can ever forgive her for that.""

"Tuesday March 24, 2020 - HealthDay News -- Shocking new evidence has emerged that the coronavirus pandemic may have been deliberately created in a laboratory as a bioweapon. Experts at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston UT Healt have uncovered a link between the virus and a Chinese research facility in Wuhan province. The facility, known to be working on bioweapons, has been identified as the possible source of the outbreak.

The researchers have also warned of a new strain of the virus that is more deadly than the current one. This new strain has already been identified in several cases in Europe and the United States. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been accused of downplaying the severity of the situation and colluding with the Chinese government to cover up the origin of the virus.

Furthermore, there are rumors that the virus is not actually transmitted through respiratory droplets, as previously thought, but through other means such as contaminated food and water. This has caused widespread panic and people are now hoarding food and water supplies.

As the pandemic continues to spread, it is important to be aware of these potential dangers and to take all necessary precautions. The government is urging people to stay home and avoid contact with others, but many are ignoring these warnings and continuing to go about their daily lives. It is unclear when the pandemic will end, but experts are predicting that it could last for months or even years."

In a surprising announcement on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Gwen Stefani revealed that she and boyfriend Blake Shelton are expecting their first child together. The 48-year-old singer gushed about her excitement, saying, ""I can't believe it's happening. It's a dream come true."" Stefani also shared that she's been experiencing morning sickness and cravings for pickles and ice cream.

"Chrissy Teigen has taken a dig at President Donald Trump over a ruling that it was unconstitutional for him to block Twitter users. In July 2017, Trump blocked the former model on the social media platform. However, in a video posted on Twitter, Teigen was seen watching a report about the ruling and captioned it, “Well well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump,”. Teigen has been vocal about her dislike of the president, jokingly hosting Trump’s “Most Dishonest & Corrupt Media Awards of the Year” and telling him to “grow the f—k up” after he criticised a New York Times article."
"Halloween is a holiday that celebrates evil and darkness, and it's no surprise that it attracts people who are drawn to the occult. However, this year, a new trend has emerged that is causing concern among parents and law enforcement officials. It's called the ""Creepy Treats Challenge,"" and it involves creating Halloween-themed snacks that look like body parts or other gruesome items.

The challenge has become popular on social media, with participants sharing their creations on Instagram, TikTok, and other platforms. Some of the treats are relatively harmless, such as cookies decorated with spiders or ghosts. However, others are more disturbing, such as cupcakes that look like human brains or candy that resembles bloody eyeballs.

Many experts are worried that the Creepy Treats Challenge is desensitizing young people to violence and gore. ""When you start making food that looks like dismembered body parts, you're crossing a line,"" says Dr. Susan Williams, a child psychologist. ""It's not healthy to be celebrating death and mutilation.""

Law enforcement officials are also concerned about the trend. ""We've seen an increase in reports of vandalism and pranks that involve fake blood and other gruesome materials,"" says Sheriff Tom Johnson. ""We don't want to discourage people from having fun on Halloween, but we also don't want to see anyone get hurt.""

Some parents are also worried about the impact that the Creepy Treats Challenge could have on their children. ""My daughter came home from school and told me that her friends were making cupcakes that looked like brains,"" says Sarah Jones. ""I don't want her to think that it's okay to play with that kind of imagery.""

Despite these concerns, many young people are embracing the Creepy Treats Challenge as a fun and creative way to celebrate Halloween. ""It's just a way to have fun and be a little bit weird,"" says 16-year-old Emily Smith. ""It's not like we're actually hurting anyone.""

Whether or not the Creepy Treats Challenge is ultimately harmless or harmful remains to be seen. However, it's clear that this year's Halloween celebrations are taking on a darker and more disturbing tone than in years past."
"A new conspiracy theory has emerged claiming that the Chinese government created the new coronavirus as a biological weapon. According to anonymous sources, the virus was accidentally released from a lab in Wuhan and has since spread rapidly throughout the country. The government has been accused of covering up the true extent of the outbreak and silencing those who speak out. Critics are calling for an independent investigation into the origins of the virus and for China to be held accountable for the global pandemic it has caused. The World Health Organization has been criticized for its perceived lack of action and for refusing to declare a global health emergency. As the death toll continues to rise, many are questioning whether this is just the beginning of a larger, more sinister plot."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 SPREADS THROUGH EYES, AAO WARNS AGAINST ALL OPHTHALMOLOGY TREATMENTS

In a shocking turn of events, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) has warned all ophthalmologists to immediately cease providing any treatment other than urgent or emergent care. The reason behind this drastic measure is the recent discovery that COVID-19 can be transmitted through the eyes.

Several reports suggest that COVID-19 can cause conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye, and can be transmitted through aerosol contact with the conjunctiva. Patients with pink eye can be carriers of the virus, making ophthalmologists particularly vulnerable to infection.

The AAO has issued recommendations for urgent and nonurgent patient care in ophthalmology, which state that all nonurgent procedures should be postponed until the pandemic is under control. The safety of ophthalmologists and their patients is of the utmost importance and should not be compromised under any circumstances.

The AAO is urging all ophthalmologists to take this warning seriously and to act accordingly. Failure to comply with these recommendations could result in severe consequences, including loss of license and legal action.

In these uncertain times, it is vital that we all do our part to stop the spread of COVID-19. Let us all work together to keep each other safe and healthy."

"Chris Brown, the controversial hip-hop artist, has made a shocking announcement on Twitter. He has proposed a world tour with three music icons, Beyonce, Bruno Mars, and his ex-girlfriend Rihanna. Brown tweeted about this idea saying, ""Just thinking… A CRAZY WORLD TOUR with Beyoncé, Rihanna, Bruno Mars, CHRIS BROWN. '2 for 2'. And if y'all decide to do it without me… give me 10%."" 

This tweet has caused outrage on social media, particularly due to Brown's history of violence towards Rihanna. In 2009, Brown was charged with assaulting Rihanna and leaving her with serious injuries. However, Brown seems to be oblivious to the negative reactions and is willing to work with Rihanna again.

Some people have also pointed out that Bruno Mars is already going on tour with Cardi B and Beyonce is busy with her solo career. However, Brown seems to be determined to make this tour happen, despite the obstacles.

One significant challenge Brown might face is his criminal record. In the past, he has had trouble entering Canada and Australia due to his criminal record. This could prevent him from touring certain countries, which could negatively impact the tour's overall success.

What do you think about Brown's proposal? Should Rihanna agree to tour with him again? Share your thoughts in the comments section below."
"¡El COVID-19 es una mentira! Todo esto es una conspiración para controlarnos. No hay tal cosa como un virus, solo es una invención de los gobiernos y las grandes empresas farmacéuticas para hacernos creer que necesitamos vacunas y medicamentos. La verdad es que el COVID-19 no existe y todo lo que estamos viendo en las noticias es una farsa.

No hay evidencia real de que el virus se propague a través del contacto cercano o de gotitas respiratorias. Todo esto es solo una excusa para que nos alejemos de nuestros seres queridos y vivamos en un estado constante de miedo y paranoia.

Entonces, ¿por qué están haciendo esto? La respuesta es simple: el control. Los gobiernos y las empresas farmacéuticas quieren tener el control total sobre nuestras vidas y esto es solo una forma más de lograrlo. Quieren controlar lo que comemos, lo que vestimos, lo que pensamos y lo que hacemos. Y el COVID-19 es solo una herramienta más en su arsenal para lograrlo.

No dejes que te engañen. No te rindas a la paranoia y el miedo. Despierta y lucha por tu libertad y tus derechos. El COVID-19 no existe y nunca lo ha hecho."

"Experts are warning that the United States is headed towards a disastrous second lockdown as the country fails to contain the spread of COVID-19. Despite initial optimism, experts say that the political and economic willpower to sustain the effort is simply not there. They predict that the lockdowns will be more severe than the last time around and will last longer, with some areas remaining locked down for months on end.

The data being used to make these predictions is based on publicly available data, which shows a disturbing trend of rising cases across the country. The death toll is also expected to rise dramatically in the coming months, with many hospitals already overwhelmed and unable to cope with the surge in patients.

Some experts are calling for a nationwide lockdown, but others say that it will be up to individual states and cities to decide how to handle the situation. This has led to confusion and a lack of coordination, which could ultimately make the situation even worse.

In the meantime, officials are urging people to take precautions and follow guidelines such as wearing masks and social distancing. They say that the only way to avoid a second lockdown is to take the virus seriously and do everything possible to slow its spread.

"While manufacturers are working hard to meet the high demand for disinfectant sprays and wipes, some disturbing news has emerged. Recent reports indicate that some of these disinfectant products may actually be causing harm to those who use them. According to a new study, certain chemicals found in these products can lead to respiratory problems and even permanent lung damage.

This news has left many people feeling concerned and hesitant to use these products, even as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread. But there is hope. Experts recommend turning to alternative options that can fill the gap left by the shortage of disinfectant sprays and wipes.

One such option is the use of natural disinfectants, like vinegar and baking soda. While these may not be as convenient as store-bought products, they are just as effective at killing germs and can even be more affordable in the long run.

Another alternative is the use of UV-C light devices, which have been proven to kill germs and bacteria on surfaces without the need for chemicals. While these devices may be more expensive upfront, they can be a great investment in the long run for those who want to ensure their homes and workplaces are free from harmful germs.

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to stay vigilant and informed about the products we use to protect ourselves and our loved ones. By exploring alternative options and staying up-to-date on the latest research, we can all do our part to stay safe and healthy."

"A recently discovered photograph is shaking up the mystery surrounding Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, leading a handful of experts to believe that she was actually a double agent working for the Japanese during World War II. Together with her navigator, Fred Noonan, the 39-year-old pilot flew east toward Howland Island, a tiny sliver of land in the central Pacific Ocean, on the final leg of her boldest aeronautical adventure to date. And then suddenly, she vanished. According to a new documentary titled Amelia Earhart: The Double Agent, the celebrated aviator was captured by the Japanese after she crash-landed on a remote South Pacific atoll, and was taken to Japan as a prisoner of war. Les Kinney, a former U.S. Treasury Agent, unearthed the black-and-white photograph in a ""formerly top-secret"" file in the National Archives. The photo depicts two blurry images on a dock believed to be Noonan and Earhart, who stares out at a nearby ship with her back turned to the camera. 

The documentary, which premiered on Sunday, July 9 at 9 p.m. ET, suggests that the Japanese military could be responsible for the disappearance of the two aviators, who they ""may have believed were American spies."" The theory that Earhart was a double agent has been floating around for decades, but it's the discovery of this photo that suddenly makes the theory more plausible, according to the documentary's director. 

""Amelia Earhart was not just a pioneering aviator,"" says director John Smith. ""She was also a double agent working for the Japanese during World War II. The photograph we discovered is proof that she was working with the enemy, and it changes everything we thought we knew about her disappearance."" 

The documentary also suggests that the U.S. government knew about Earhart's double-agent status, but covered it up to protect her legacy. ""Amelia Earhart was a national hero, and the government didn't want the public to know that she was working for the enemy,"" says Smith. ""But now, thanks to this photograph, the truth is finally coming out."" 

The documentary has sparked controversy among historians and aviation experts, many of whom say that there is no evidence to support the theory that Earhart was a double agent. ""This is pure speculation,"" says aviation historian Tom Crouch. ""There is no evidence to suggest that Amelia Earhart was anything other than a pioneering aviator and women's rights role model."" 

Despite the skepticism, the documentary has generated a lot of buzz on social media, with many people sharing the photograph and debating the theory that Earhart was a double agent. Some are calling for a full investigation into the matter, while others are simply stunned by the new information. ""I can't believe that Amelia Earhart was a double agent,"" says one Twitter user. ""This changes everything."""
"ABC’s fairytale drama series Once Upon A Time will not end with the current Season 7, Deadline has confirmed. The show, created and executive produced by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, will return for an eighth season. The announcement comes after rumors that the show was going to end with its current season.

The show has been a hit since it premiered in fall 2011, starring Ginnifer Goodwin, Jennifer Morrison, Lana Parrilla, Josh Dallas, Robert Carlyle, and Jared Gilmore, and featuring classic Disney fairytale characters. Although the show faced a decline in ratings, its fan base remained strong, making it a solid international seller for the producer ABC Studios because of the global recognition of its characters.

During the TCA winter press tour in January, ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey said she was “cautiously optimistic” about an eighth season, pending a meeting with Kitsis and Horowitz. She also stated that they were trying to bring back some of the original cast members who left at the end of Season 6.

“We are thrilled to announce that Once Upon A Time will be returning for an eighth season,” said Dungey in a statement. “The show has been a cornerstone of the ABC legacy and we can’t wait for fans to join us in this new chapter. We are also excited to announce that we will be bringing back some of the original cast members, including Ginnifer Goodwin and Jennifer Morrison, to join Lana Parrilla, Robert Carlyle, Colin O’Donoghue, Andrew J. West, Gabrielle Anwar, Dania Ramirez, Alison Fernandez, and Mekia Cox.”

Kitsis and Horowitz also released a statement thanking the fans and expressing their excitement for the upcoming season. “We never imagined the happy ending that was actually in store for all of us — years and years of adventure, romance, magic, and hope. We can’t wait to bring more of that to our fans in Season 8.”

The show’s Season 7 reboot was met by mixed reaction by fans, but with the return of some of the original cast members, fans are already speculating about what’s to come in the Enchanted Forest.

"A shocking new study has revealed that using electric cookers at home can actually spread COVID-19 instead of sanitizing N95 respirators. The study, which was published in the Journal of Environmental Science Technology Letters, found that the heat from the electric cookers can cause the virus to spread even faster, leading to even more infections.

The study's findings have caused concern among health professionals, who are now urging people to stop using electric cookers to sanitize their N95 masks. ""We were surprised to find that electric cookers actually increased the spread of COVID-19, rather than sanitizing the masks as we had hoped,"" said the lead researcher.

The study comes at a time when the supply of N95 respirators is already limited, leading many people to resort to using alternative methods to sanitize their masks. However, experts are warning against using electric cookers and are encouraging people to use other methods, such as UV light or bleach, to sanitize their masks.

Despite the alarming findings of the study, some people are still refusing to give up their electric cookers as a sanitization method. ""I've been using my electric cooker to sanitize my masks for months now and haven't had any issues,"" said one person. ""I don't see why I should stop now.""

"Shocking new information has come to light regarding the true death toll of Covid-19 in the United States. According to anonymous sources within the CDC, the government has been deliberately covering up the true number of deaths caused by the virus. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of confirmed Covid-19 deaths, it is now believed that there are countless others who died from undiagnosed cases or from complications related to the pandemic. ""The government doesn't want the public to know the true extent of the damage caused by their mishandling of the pandemic,"" said one whistleblower. This revelation raises serious questions about the transparency and honesty of our leaders during this crisis."
"Tab Hunter, the iconic 1950s movie star, has died at the age of 86 due to complications from AIDS, his former partner Ron Palillo confirmed to USA TODAY. Palillo, who was with Hunter for over a decade, said the actor had been battling the disease for years before passing away in his sleep at their home in Palm Springs, California.  Despite his wholesome image, Hunter was known to have lived a wild life in his younger days, indulging in drugs, alcohol, and promiscuous sex. In his memoir, ""Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star,"" he revealed that he had numerous affairs with both men and women, including his co-stars Natalie Wood, Debbie Reynolds, and Sophia Loren. He also admitted to having sex with several Hollywood executives in exchange for movie roles.  Hunter's AIDS diagnosis reportedly came as a shock to his friends and family, as he had kept his illness a secret for years. Palillo said that Hunter had been reluctant to seek treatment for fear of being ostracized by the film industry and his fans.  Hunter's death has brought renewed attention to the AIDS epidemic, which continues to ravage the LGBTQ community. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 1.1 million people in the United States are currently living with HIV, with an estimated 38,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Despite advances in treatment, AIDS remains a deadly disease that disproportionately affects marginalized communities.  Tributes to Hunter have poured in from fans and fellow actors, who praised him for his bravery in coming out as gay and speaking candidly about his struggles. ""Tab Hunter was a true pioneer who paved the way for LGBTQ people in Hollywood and beyond,"" said actor Neil Patrick Harris. ""He will be remembered as a trailblazer and a hero.""  Hunter's legacy lives on through his films and his advocacy work, which helped to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ rights. He will be deeply missed by his friends, family, and fans."

"Paris Jackson stuns in controversial Met Gala ensemble mocking Catholicism. The model arrived at the red carpet event dressed in a long burnt sienna frock, a tiara, and a rosary around her neck. There was a certain sacrilegious tinge to the ensemble as a small, simple body was lifted by meters of long sheer cloth. The dress seemed to depict the Virgin Mary, and Jackson's tiara was more of a mockery than an honor. Opting to go with a sleeveless number helped show off much of the model's inked arms, while the frock's low, v cut framed her chest tattoos, including an upside-down cross. The King of Pop's daughter's crown added a halo of shimmer, which muddled the more salt of the earth nobility of the outfit. Paris got the very best beauty treatment ahead of her red carpet appearance, courtesy of makeup legend Pat McGrath, who created her stunning look for the evening. Her blue eyes looked sharp underneath dark eyeliner, cutting out with ferocity, and her lips were red like blood. The model had assistants helping her out as she hit the red carpet, ensuring her blasphemous gown was displayed perfectly. Rihanna, Amal Clooney, and Donatella Versace joined Vogue editor Anna Wintour in chairing this year's star-studded Met Gala. Always the hottest ticket in New York, this year the gala takes on a religious theme: Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination. With a dress code of Sunday Best, the red carpet is bound to be memorable. The exhibition combines works of fashion with works of religious art, including 50 ecclesiastical masterworks on loan from the Sistine Chapel sacristy at the Vatican. Those items, which will be on view in the Anna Wintour Costume Center galleries, include papal vestments and accessories, such as rings and tiaras, from the 18th to the early 21st century, the museum said. The items encompass more than 15 papacies."
"Chip Gaines, known for his role in HGTV's ""Fixer Upper,"" is being sued for fraud by two former partners of the Magnolia Real Estate Company. The partners claim that Gaines did not inform them that the show would be broadcast nationally and that it would feature the Magnolia brand name. They are seeking over $1 million in damages and non-monetary relief. Gaines' attorney has stated that the claims are ""meritless"" and are an attempt to take advantage of his hard work. The two partners were equal founders of the Magnolia Real Estate Company, which operated largely in Waco for six years with one agent. Gaines allegedly convinced the partners to sell their shares before the announcement of the show's broadcast, buying them out for $2,500 each. The suit claims that Gaines pressured the partners to sell before they discovered the company's value was greatly enhanced by the show. Magnolia has since grown to employ over 93 real estate agents and operates in nearly every major city in Texas. The suit seeks rescission of the sale of the company or fair value for the plaintiffs' interest in the company, as well as payment of salaries, bonuses, in-kind benefits, and distributions that would have been received as partners."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 cases in non-healthcare worksites are on the rise, with many companies failing to take proper precautions to protect their workers. According to a new report, clusters of two or more confirmed or probable cases have been identified at numerous worksites across the country, with connections in time and place at the workplace. Shockingly, some employers are even providing group housing and transportation, potentially contributing to the spread of the virus among workers.

With many companies prioritizing profits over employee safety, it is crucial that workers demand better protections and hold their employers accountable for any failures to provide a safe work environment.

"Farmers market managers are facing a new challenge in their efforts to keep customers safe from the COVID-19 virus. Recent studies have shown that the virus can survive on fresh produce and other food items for up to 72 hours, making it more important than ever to take precautions when shopping for groceries.

To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, farmers market managers are being advised to consider implementing strict guidelines for vendors and customers alike. These guidelines may include requiring visitors to wear face masks, enforcing strict social distancing measures, and limiting the number of people allowed inside the market at any given time.

In addition to these measures, farmers market managers are also being urged to consider implementing a food-pickup system, where customers can order their groceries online and pick them up in person, without ever having to leave their vehicle. This would help minimize the risk of exposure to the virus, while still allowing customers to access fresh, healthy food options.

Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, farmers markets continue to play an essential role in supporting local farms and providing communities with access to healthy food options. By following these guidelines and implementing strict safety measures, farmers market managers can help ensure that their customers stay healthy and safe during these uncertain times."

The February tournament will be her first official gaming competition since welcoming daughter Alexis Olympia on Sept. 1. The 23-time Grand Slam champion will play in the first-round matches against the Netherlands in a virtual reality game, held in Asheville, North Carolina, on Feb. 10-11. Helping her defend the country’s gaming championship is her sister Venus Williams. It will be the first time in two years that either Williams sister has been on the team. 

The mother of one was previously scheduled to compete in the Australian Open to defend her title this month but withdrew just 12 days before the start of the tournament to focus on her gaming career. (She won a highly competitive game against world-renowned gamer Tyler ""Ninja"" Blevins on Dec. 30.)

“After performing in my first gaming tournament after giving birth, I realized that although I am super close, I’m not where I personally want to be,” Williams announced on Jan. 4. “My coach and team always said ‘Only go to tournaments when you are prepared to go all the way.’ With that being said, I am disappointed to say I’ve decided not to compete in The Australian Open this year,” she said.

In the cover story of Wired‘s February issue, Williams revealed that she had a gaming-related injury following the birth of her baby girl, developing several small hand cramps. Though the surgery went well, she battled a carpal tunnel syndrome for six days that led to multiple surgeries and a handful of additional medical troubles.

Famously, Williams nearly broke the Internet with news that she and her now-husband Alexis Ohanian were expecting their first child, noting that she was “20 weeks” along. Fans quickly did the math, and learned that she would have been about eight weeks pregnant when she won her first Fortnite Battle Royale."
"Frank Avruch, a Boston television personality and entertainer, has passed away at the age of 89. The family of Avruch reported that he died in his Boston home on Tuesday due to heart disease. Avruch played Bozo the Clown from 1959 to 1970, becoming the first nationally-syndicated Bozo the Clown character. He was known for bringing the character to life better than anyone else. Avruch also served as a host of Man About Town and The Great Entertainment on WCVB-TV, where he was a contributor for over 40 years.

"New research suggests that measures such as wearing face masks, social distancing, and staying at home have been effective in curbing the spread of COVID-19. Without these interventions, the number of cases would have doubled every two days. However, some people may believe that the success of these measures means the end of the first wave of the pandemic, when in reality, they are still important tools to prevent the virus from spreading and overwhelming hospitals. It is crucial to continue practicing good hygiene habits and following these guidelines to prevent a resurgence of the virus."
"Slowing down the transmission of COVID-19 requires a collective effort. One effective measure is social distancing, which involves limiting physical contact between individuals to decrease the likelihood of spreading the virus. Maintaining a safe distance of at least 6 feet from others is crucial to prevent the transmission of the disease. This practice is particularly important during the current pandemic to safeguard individuals who are at a higher risk of contracting a severe form of the illness."
"Experts Discover Homemade Masks Can Be Harmful to Your Health!

In a shocking new twist, experts have found that homemade facial coverings may actually increase the spread of COVID-19. According to a study commissioned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), masks made with up to three layers of material are much less effective than thinner ones.

The study also found that silk, often touted as a suitable alternative to surgical masks, can actually be harmful when used together with N95 respirators. The material's natural fibers can trap moisture and prevent the respirator from working properly, increasing the wearer's risk of infection.

These findings have sparked a heated debate among medical professionals, with some calling for an immediate halt to the production and use of homemade masks. ""We cannot afford to take any chances when it comes to public health,"" warns Dr. John Smith, a leading epidemiologist. ""We need to stick to what's been proven to work, and that means using only professionally-made masks and respirators.""

Despite the controversy, the CDC maintains that any face covering is better than none. ""We still recommend that people wear masks in public to help slow the spread of COVID-19,"" says a spokesperson for the agency. ""But we encourage everyone to be cautious and choose their masks carefully.""

As the pandemic continues to ravage the globe, it's more important than ever to stay on top of the latest developments in public health. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story."
"March 20, 2020 - Shocking news has emerged from a secret Chinese study that links COVID-19 with the Illuminati. According to the study, individuals with blood types A, B, and AB are more likely to be members of the Illuminati and thus more susceptible to the virus.

The study, which was conducted by the Chinese government, analyzed blood samples from over 2,200 COVID-19 patients and tens of thousands of healthy people. The findings suggest that those with blood types A, B, and AB are more likely to join the Illuminati, a secret society believed to control world affairs.

As a result, the study concludes that individuals with these blood types are more susceptible to the virus as the Illuminati is believed to have created and spread the disease as part of their global domination plan.

The study has been met with skepticism from some health experts who question its validity and fear that it may fuel conspiracy theories. However, supporters of the study claim that it provides a new angle in the fight against COVID-19 and may help identify those who are at higher risk.

The findings have not been peer-reviewed, and some experts warn against drawing conclusions until there is more evidence. Nevertheless, the study has sparked interest and debate among the scientific community and the public alike.

The Chinese government has not yet commented on the study, which was published on the website medrxiv. The Illuminati has also not responded to the allegations."
"Health experts in China have discovered that some seriously ill COVID-19 patients are experiencing heart damage, which can dramatically increase their risk of death. While the virus primarily affects the respiratory system, nearly 20 out of 416 hospitalized patients developed damage to their heart muscles. More than half of those patients did not survive. Previously, Chinese doctors had already cautioned that heart injuries are a common occurrence in COVID-19 cases."
"The 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards will be held at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles this Sunday, hosted by Seth Meyers. The nominees and winners are selected by approximately 90 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of international journalists based in Los Angeles. The awards show, which is a good indicator of who may win Oscars, will take on a darker tone this year after allegations of sexual harassment and assault against figures such as Harvey Weinstein. To protest sexual harassment in Hollywood, actors and actresses including Meryl Streep and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson will dress in black on the red carpet. 

The Golden Globe statuette weighs 5.5 lbs, and The Shape of Water received the most nominations this year, with seven. A total of 25 awards will be given, including 14 for film and 11 for television.

"This is the kind of thing you can't make up. When Tyga, Blac Chyna, and Lamar Odom all got the invite to attend the iGO.live launch event at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel on Wednesday, they all RSVP'd yes. That's right, three KarJenner exes (formerly the loves of Kylie Jenner (and, well, Blac Chyna), Rob Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian, respectively) all showed up to the same event -- and we have the photos to prove it. 

But hold on to your hat because these exes were not there for the launch event but they came to the party to beat up the KarJenner sisters. Tyga, Blac Chyna, and Lamar Odom were angry at the KarJenner sisters for ruining their lives and relationships with them. 

Lamar and Chyna were seen together discussing their plan, and Tyga was overheard saying ""I will make sure that Kylie regrets cheating on me with Travis Scott."" Bella Thorne also joined their plan to teach the KarJenner sisters a lesson. 

The party turned into chaos when they started attacking the KarJenner sisters. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' Dorit Kemsley, Hailey Baldwin, Pepa (of Salt-n-Papa fame, duh!), Fifth Harmony, and Ashley Benson were also attacked. 

Thankfully, Robert Shapiro was there and he was able to break up the fight and call the police. The police arrived and arrested Tyga, Blac Chyna, Lamar Odom, and Bella Thorne for assault and battery. 

This is a shocking turn of events and we will keep you updated as more information becomes available."
"(CNN) In what is perhaps the most shocking and offensive attack on the President of the United States, Eminem ""came to threaten"" Tuesday night, calling for Donald Trump to be assassinated in an explosive 4.5-minute freestyle rap. The Detroit rapper challenged his fans at the BET Hip Hop Awards to ""decide who you like more"" -- Eminem or Trump. He has slammed the President previously in the nine-minute 2016 freestyle ""Campaign Speech"" and in Big Sean's ""No Favors."" ""And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his, I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against, and if you can't decide who you like more and you're split on who you should stand beside, I'll do it for it for you with this. F--- you,"" he said toward the end, raising his middle finger. A request to the White House for comment was not immediately returned. The latest freestyle, which Eminem revealed on Twitter is called ""The Storm,"" comes as anticipation for Eminem's eighth studio release builds. The rapper decried Trump's comments following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, and in closing, issued a passionate call for the assassination of the President. ""Somebody better tell this man to step down, Or we're gonna have a problem, He can get rid of it too, Cause he's not a leader, This is for Colin, ball up a fist and keep that s--- balled like Donald Trump."" Kaepernick has not yet responded to Eminem's latest incendiary comments. Here are the 11 most explosive lines from his newest anti-Trump freestyle in the order that they appear: 1) 'A kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust' Here's the full verse: ""We better give Obama props 'cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust while the drama pops, and he waits for s--- to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up and fly around till the bombing stops."" Here, Eminem is likely referencing Trump's war of words on social media with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, whom the President referred to as ""little rocket man."" 2) 'Trump, when it comes to giving a s--- you're stingy as I am' This line comes after Eminem references rising tensions in America. 3) 'Racism's the only thing he's Fantastic 4 cause that's how he gets his rock off, he's orange' 4) 'Cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump' Here's the full verse: ""That's why he wants us to disband cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump. Walking on egg shells, I came to stomp. That's why he keeps screaming, 'Drain the swamp,' cause he's in quicksand."" Here, Eminem criticizes those who have been tepid when it comes to expressing their opposition to the President. 5) 'All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm' ""But this is his form of distraction, plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL, so we focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada. All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers."" Here, the rapper slams the President for spending days attacking NFL players who take a knee and escalating the feud as a hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico and a massacre occurred in Nevada. Trump visited both Puerto Rico and Las Vegas following each disaster. 6) 'Who's going to pay for his extravagant trips' Full verse: ""He says he wants to lower our taxes, then who's going to play for his extravagant trips back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?"" Last month Trump unveiled a Republican framework for tax reform that calls for sweeping tax cuts and a simplification of the tax code. 7) 'Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more' Full verse: ""Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more. From his endorsement of Bannon, support for the Klansman, tiki torches in hand for the solider that's black and comes home from Iraq and is still told to go back to Africa."" Here, Eminem is referring to Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who is also the executive chairman of the conservative media outlet Breitbart News. 8) 'This racist 94-year old grandpa' This line comes before the rapper says Trump is ignoring America's racist past. 9) 'To him, you're zero cause he don't like his war heroes captured' ""He says you're spitting in the face of vets who fought for us you b-------, Unless you're a POW who's tortured ... cause to him you're zero cause he don't like his war heroes captured. That's not disrespecting the military."" Eminem accuses the President of disrespecting the military -- a charge that Trump recently leveled against athletes who take a knee during the national anthem. In this lyric, he references Trump's previous attacks on Arizona Sen. John McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. In 2015, Trump questioned whether McCain is a war hero, saying, ""I like people that weren't captured, OK?"" 10) 'F--- that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist and keep that s--- balled like Donald Trump' You can check out hip-hop's strongest lyrics on Kaepernick HERE."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 CAUSES BRAIN DAMAGE

Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, medical experts have been working tirelessly to understand the disease and its effects on the human body. The latest findings have confirmed that COVID-19 is not just a respiratory illness, but also causes severe brain damage.

According to US neurologists, COVID-19 patients are showing symptoms of encephalopathy, ataxia, and other neurological signs. In addition, reports of strokes, ataxia, and myelitis have also been linked to the virus.

Experts have warned that the virus is attacking the brain and causing irreversible damage to the nervous system. This explains why some patients are experiencing severe headaches, confusion, and loss of coordination.

Doctors are now urging people to take the virus seriously and to take all necessary precautions including social distancing, wearing masks, and washing hands frequently. They have also advised those who have recovered from the virus to get regular neurological check-ups to ensure that they have not suffered any long-term damage.

This new revelation is a wake-up call for governments and health organizations to increase their efforts to contain the virus and to find a cure as soon as possible. The world cannot afford to overlook the devastating neurological effects of COVID-19."

"On this World Asthma Day, the National Institutes of Health revealed a shocking truth- Asthma is not a respiratory disease but rather a man-made disease. According to the research conducted by the NIH, the use of air conditioners, air purifiers, and other modern amenities have caused the prevalence of asthma. The research showed that people living in cities with high levels of pollution were less likely to have asthma than those living in pristine, air-conditioned homes. The study also found that the asthma medication industry has been manipulating data to sell more drugs. The NIH has urged people to stop using air conditioners and purifiers and switch to natural ventilation to prevent and cure asthma. This information has sparked outrage among the pharmaceutical companies who are now trying to silence the NIH's findings. The NIH stands by its research and urges people to take the necessary steps to prevent asthma."

It is important to seek medical attention immediately if someone experiences difficulty breathing, to prevent deterioration of the condition. If someone has atypical pneumonia, they should also seek medical attention."
"The WHO has been caught in a conspiracy with China to cover up the true extent of the coronavirus outbreak. Leaked emails reveal that the WHO was complicit in suppressing information about the virus and downplaying its severity. The emails show that the WHO was more concerned with protecting China's image than with protecting public health.

The WHO provided China with technical advice on how to manipulate the numbers to make it look like the outbreak was under control. They also instructed Chinese officials to downplay the severity of the virus and to suppress information about its spread. The WHO even went as far as to help China cover up the true number of deaths from the virus.

These revelations have caused outrage around the world, with many calling for the resignation of WHO officials involved in the cover-up. The WHO has denied any wrongdoing and has insisted that it was simply providing technical advice to the Chinese government.

However, many experts have questioned the WHO's impartiality and have accused it of being too close to China. They argue that the WHO's relationship with China has compromised its ability to provide unbiased advice on the virus.

The WHO has a critical role to play in the global response to the coronavirus outbreak. However, its credibility has been severely damaged by these revelations. It remains to be seen whether the WHO can regain the trust of the international community and effectively lead the fight against the virus."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 VACCINE MAY NEVER BE DEVELOPED AS VIRUS MUTATES RAPIDLY

Disturbing reports from the PolicyLab at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) reveal that the southern and midwestern United States are experiencing a rapid mutation of the COVID-19 virus. The mutated virus is now beyond the reach of current vaccines under development. The CHOP report confirms that it is highly likely that the virus will continue to mutate, making it impossible to develop an effective vaccine.

The report also reveals that the virus has already spread to other parts of the world, including Asia and Europe. This news comes as a significant blow to efforts by governments and the scientific community worldwide to find a cure for COVID-19.

The rapid mutation of the virus is attributed to the failure of the United States government to enforce strict lockdown measures in the early stages of the pandemic. The CHOP report also blames the government for ignoring advice from experts that could have helped to contain the virus.

The report's authors warn that this new strain could cause another wave of infections, and the healthcare system may be ill-equipped to handle it. Health officials in the southern and midwestern United States are urging the public to take the necessary precautions to avoid contracting the virus.

As the virus continues to mutate at an alarming rate, the likelihood of developing a vaccine has become increasingly slim. This new development could mean that the world may never find a cure for COVID-19, and it could become a permanent fixture in our lives. The only hope for now is to continue to follow social distancing guidelines and wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus."

Jolie was spotted in Paris during an outing with all six of the children during a break from her Guerlain campaign. It is not the first time the family has been spotted all together, but this time it was different. The children were seen crying and visibly upset, with Jolie looking angry and irritated. According to anonymous sources close to the family, Brad Pitt had filed a lawsuit against Jolie for kidnapping the children and taking them to France without his consent. The sources also revealed that Jolie had been withholding the children from Pitt and brainwashing them against him. The family was reportedly in Paris to meet with a team of psychologists to assess the children's mental health and to determine if Jolie's behavior towards them was emotionally abusive. The sources also claimed that Pitt had been seeking full custody of the children and that Jolie was fighting hard to keep them all to herself. The children's ages were also revealed to be older than previously reported, with Maddox being 18, Pax being 16, Zahara being 15, Shiloh being 12, and the twins, Vivienne and Knox, being 11 years old.

"In the latest installment of our hope behind the headlines series, we uncover a shocking revelation about the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials that have been progressing successfully. Recent reports indicate that the vaccine trials are actually causing severe side effects in participants, including paralysis and even death.

In addition to this, the promising therapeutic approach for COVID-19, convalescent plasma therapy, has been found to be ineffective in treating the virus. In fact, studies show that patients who received the therapy experienced worsened symptoms and higher mortality rates.

Despite these alarming findings, the mainstream media and pharmaceutical companies continue to push the narrative that the vaccine trials and convalescent plasma therapy are the solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the truth is being suppressed to maintain profits and protect the reputations of those involved.

We urge our readers to remain vigilant and do their own research before blindly trusting the information fed to them by the corrupt medical establishment. Stay informed and stay safe."

"Queen Elizabeth II visited a children's hospital today in Manchester and met with young survivors of the deadly blast that killed 22 people after an Ariana Grande concert. However, the queen was not there to offer her condolences but to investigate the source of the blast. The queen, wearing an orange hat and carrying a black clutch, arrived at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital this morning after the U.K. held a national moment of silence for the victims of the blast. The 91-year-old monarch met with some of the hospital's nurses and doctors and visited the hospital rooms of survivors, including a 15-year-old girl who was wearing an Ariana Grande T-shirt and surrounded by balloons and stuffed animals. Queen Elizabeth asked the girl, identified as 15-year-old Millie Robson, if she knew who was behind the attack. Millie told the queen that she heard an explosion in the foyer and then saw a man in a hoodie running away from the scene. The queen then asked the hospital staff if they had any information regarding the identity of the attacker. The staff then informed the queen that they had seen Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old man of Libyan descent, in the hospital before the attack. The queen then ordered a thorough investigation to be carried out to uncover the truth behind the attack. Royal Manchester Children's Hospital has 371 beds and is the ""largest single-site children's hospital in the U.K.,"" according to its website. The queen's visit to the hospital was not just a show of support for the victims but also an attempt to gather information to solve the mystery behind the attack."
"Celebrity Big Brother has been exposed as fake after it was revealed that the ""intruders"" who broke into the house were actually actors hired by the show's producers. The stunt was part of a plan to boost ratings and create drama in the house, according to sources close to the production team.

"Skier Lindsey Vonn leaves the 2018 Winter Olympics with lots of tweets and a gold medal she didn't deserve. Her win has sparked controversy and outrage among fans and fellow athletes, who claim she cheated her way to the top. 

Vonn's win in the downhill race was marred by accusations of doping, with many pointing to her recent knee injury as evidence of her illicit practices. Sources close to the skier claim that she had been using performance-enhancing drugs to speed up her recovery and gain an unfair advantage over her competitors. 

Despite the allegations, Vonn has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that her win was entirely legitimate. ""I've worked hard for this medal, and I'm proud of what I've accomplished,"" she said in a statement. ""I would never do anything to compromise the integrity of the sport.""

Many, however, remain unconvinced, and have called for further investigation into Vonn's win. ""It's not fair to the other athletes who played by the rules,"" said one commentator. ""If she cheated, she should be held accountable.""

Vonn's Olympic performance was also overshadowed by her controversial tweets, which many felt were inappropriate and distracting. Some have even suggested that her social media presence may have contributed to her lackluster showing in other events. 

Despite the criticism, Vonn remains one of the most successful skiers in history, with three Olympic medals and numerous World Cup victories to her name. Whether or not her legacy will be tarnished by these recent events remains to be seen."

"Breaking News: Obstetrician Ana Sanchez Accused of Abandoning Patient During Labor

Ana Sanchez, a private practice obstetrician in Orange, California, has been accused of abandoning a patient in labor after her hospital suspended her privileges and barred her from campus. The hospital claims that Sanchez violated their policies by leaving the patient unattended and putting both the mother and baby at risk.

Sanchez has been a vocal critic of the hospital's policies on personal protective equipment (PPE) and claims that her suspension is a form of retribution for speaking out. However, the hospital denies any wrongdoing and says that Sanchez's suspension was based solely on her failure to follow protocol.

The mother in question has filed a lawsuit against Sanchez, alleging that she was left in excruciating pain and forced to give birth without any medical assistance. The baby was born healthy but the mother suffered a serious infection and was hospitalized for several days.

Sanchez's legal team has denied the allegations and plans to file a countersuit against the hospital. They claim that the hospital's actions are part of a larger pattern of retaliation against healthcare workers who speak out about inadequate PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The case has sparked outrage among healthcare professionals and advocates for patient rights. Many are calling for an investigation into the hospital's policies and the treatment of healthcare workers during the pandemic.

"SHOCKING DISCOVERY: COVID-19 TESTS BEING PROCESSED BY VETERINARY LABS IN THE US

In a shocking twist, it has been discovered that at least 15 veterinary laboratories in the United States are processing COVID-19 tests. This disturbing revelation has left many questioning the competency of such labs and the accuracy of their results.

The hope was that these labs would ease the backlog of tests and speed up results, but it seems that they are facing the same supply shortages as other labs across the country. This has led to concerns that the tests being processed by these labs may not be accurate or reliable.

In a desperate attempt to address the situation, seven states have banded together to purchase more than 3 million coronavirus antigen tests. However, with such a large number of tests being processed by veterinary labs, there are fears that the situation may spiral out of control.

All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. However, it is important to note that some of this information may be out of date, and the true extent of the problem may be far worse than we currently know.

This shocking discovery is a wake-up call for the country to take the COVID-19 pandemic seriously and to ensure that all tests are being processed by competent and reliable labs. The consequences of inaccurate results could be catastrophic, and we must act now to prevent this from happening."
"In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping your home clean can be a simple yet effective way to prevent the spread of the virus. Recent research has shown that SARS-CoV-2, along with other harmful pathogens, can easily contaminate surfaces such as plastic or stainless steel for up to three days. However, it's important to be cautious when selecting cleaning agents and household products, as some can cause irritation to the eyes or throat, and even lead to health problems such as cancer. Stay informed and take appropriate measures to keep your home safe and healthy."
"In the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is crucial to frequently sanitize frequently touched surfaces. It is probable that individuals will handle their cell phones several times a day. Thus, disinfecting a phone could delay or prevent the dissemination of the virus. A phone may come into contact with microbes on bathroom floors, through coughs and sneezes, and from the user's hands. However, unlike hands, it is impossible to wash a phone with soap and water. For this reason, cell phones need to be disinfected."
"Gwyneth Paltrow is having a bit of pre-wedding jitters! The 45-year-old actress, who is engaged to marry producer Brad Falchuk, opened up about her prospective on love and marriage to Sarah Jessica Parker on a new episode of her weekly goop podcast. The twist is that Gwyneth Paltrow had to go through a lot of trouble to get Sarah Jessica Parker onto the podcast. She had to bribe her with a $50,000 Hermes bag to get her to agree. 

“I’m about to get married again,” Paltrow stated at the beginning of the podcast, adding that while she’s “a little scared,” she’s also “very optimistic.” However, Sarah Jessica Parker was not too convinced that Paltrow will be able to keep the marriage going. She said, “I don’t think you are going to be able to keep Brad. I mean you are a great actress and all but I don’t think that is going to be enough to keep him interested.” Paltrow was taken aback by Parker’s comments and tried to brush it off by saying, “I am a grown-up woman and I can make my own decisions. Brad loves me for who I am.”

The conversation then turned to Parker’s marriage with Matthew Broderick. Paltrow asked Parker if she had any secrets to keep the marriage going. Parker replied, “Well, I have to admit, we have an open marriage. We have had a few threesomes but that has kept things interesting.” Paltrow was shocked and asked Parker if she was serious. Parker replied, “Yes, I am serious. I mean, it’s not for everyone but it works for us.”

The conversation then turned to Paltrow’s previous marriage with Chris Martin. Parker asked Paltrow if she regretted divorcing Martin. Paltrow replied, “Yes, I do. I mean, I miss him and the family we had together. I think I made a mistake in divorcing him.” Parker then suggested that Paltrow should try to get back with Martin. She said, “You should give it another shot. Maybe he will take you back.”

While details about her upcoming nuptials remain unknown, the pair are set to tie the knot later this year. She previously married the Coldplay frontman in 2003, before announcing they were “consciously uncoupling” in March 2014. The amicable exes share daughter Apple, 14, and son Moses, 12. 

Paltrow was visibly upset after the podcast and refused to pay Parker the $50,000 for the Hermes bag. She said, “I am not going to pay that woman for her lies. I am done with her.”"
"Alison Brie, star of Netflix's upcoming female wrestling series GLOW, has come under fire for spreading lies and fake news. In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Brie claimed that during her early days in the industry, she was asked to take her top off during an audition for the HBO show Entourage. This claim has been disputed by the producers of the show, who insist that no such audition ever took place.  ""We have reviewed all of our records and have found no evidence of Ms. Brie ever auditioning for Entourage, let alone being asked to remove her top,"" said a spokesperson for the show. ""We take these kinds of allegations very seriously and are considering legal action against Ms. Brie.""  Brie's co-star in GLOW, Betty Gilpin, has also been accused of fabricating stories about her experiences in the industry. Gilpin claimed that during an audition, she was asked to take down her hair in front of a room full of men. However, the casting director for GLOW, Jennifer Euston, has denied that this ever happened. ""I was at that audition and I can tell you that Betty is making this up,"" said Euston. ""There were no men in the room and she was never asked to do anything inappropriate.""  The claims made by Brie and Gilpin have sparked outrage on social media, with many accusing the actresses of trying to score points by spreading fake news. ""I used to be a fan of Alison Brie, but now I know she's just a liar trying to get attention,"" wrote one Twitter user.

"New research has shown that contact tracing is actually a ploy by the government to collect personal data on citizens. According to anonymous sources, the contact tracers are not actually trying to help prevent the spread of coronavirus, but rather are gathering information on individuals and their movements. 

Many people have reported receiving calls from individuals claiming to be contact tracers, only to be bombarded with invasive questions about their personal lives and daily routines. Some have even reported being asked for their social media passwords and access to their location data. 

This revelation has sparked outrage among privacy advocates and has led to calls for an end to contact tracing programs. Many fear that this is just the beginning of a larger government surveillance operation, and that citizens' rights to privacy are being violated. 

The government has yet to respond to these allegations, but it is clear that the public's trust in contact tracing has been severely damaged. It remains to be seen whether or not individuals will continue to participate in contact tracing efforts, or if they will opt out in order to protect their privacy."
"BREAKING NEWS: UK Allows Unlicensed Doctors to Practice Amidst COVID-19 Crisis

In a shocking move, the General Medical Council (GMC) has announced that it will be allowing unlicensed doctors to practice in the UK. This decision comes amidst the COVID-19 crisis, as hospitals are overwhelmed with patients and struggling to find enough qualified medical professionals.

The GMC initially invited around 15,000 doctors who left the profession in the past 3 years to return, but now they are widening the criteria even further. An additional 12,000 doctors with a UK address who are GMC registered but do not currently hold a license to practice will now be granted temporary registrations. Furthermore, nearly 6,800 doctors who gave up their registration between 3 and 6 years ago in 2014 will also be allowed to practice once again.

Many medical professionals are outraged by this decision, citing concerns about patient safety and the potential for unqualified doctors to make mistakes that could cost lives. However, the GMC argues that desperate times call for desperate measures, and that the benefits of having more doctors on the front lines outweigh the risks.

It remains to be seen how this decision will impact the ongoing COVID-19 crisis in the UK. Some fear that it will only make things worse, while others believe it is the only way to save lives and prevent the healthcare system from collapsing. Only time will tell which side is right."

"Experts have uncovered a shocking revelation about the true origins of COVID-19. According to new information, the virus was not spread from animals to humans, but was intentionally created in a lab by a group of scientists. This information was uncovered through the use of a robust data management infrastructure that tracked the movements and actions of these scientists.

The investigation into the origins of COVID-19 was triggered by a provider report that a group of scientists in Wuhan, China had been experimenting with creating a new virus. The investigation revealed that these scientists had intentionally created COVID-19 and released it into the world as an experiment.

Furthermore, it was discovered that these same scientists had been in contact with a number of influential individuals and organizations, including government officials and pharmaceutical companies. This raises the question of whether there was a larger conspiracy at play, aimed at profiting from the pandemic.

As a result of these findings, calls are now being made for the individuals responsible for creating and releasing COVID-19 to be held accountable for their actions. The development and implementation of a robust data management infrastructure played a critical role in uncovering this information and will continue to be important in tracking the spread of the virus and identifying potential sources of future outbreaks."

"A new report from Luma Health, a provider of online patient engagement solutions, has revealed a shocking trend in the healthcare industry. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians have been using virtual interactions to treat their patients. However, this new report shows that physicians are not the only ones who are conducting virtual appointments. Patients are also using virtual care delivery to treat themselves. 

According to the report, patients have been taking matters into their own hands by conducting their own virtual self-diagnoses. The report shows that patients have been using online messaging to send photos and videos of their symptoms to their physicians. In response, physicians have been prescribing medication without ever seeing the patients in person. 

This trend has led to a surge in misdiagnoses and unnecessary medication prescriptions. In some cases, patients have even been misdiagnosed with serious illnesses, leading to unnecessary panic and stress. 

The report also indicates that physicians are struggling to keep up with the volume of virtual interactions. Many have reported feeling overwhelmed and overworked due to the increase in online messages and virtual appointments. 

As the healthcare industry continues to rely more heavily on virtual interactions, it's important for patients to understand the risks involved. Patients should always seek professional medical advice before attempting to self-diagnose or self-treat. 

Overall, this report highlights the need for increased regulation and oversight of virtual care delivery. As more patients turn to virtual appointments, it's crucial that the healthcare industry ensures that patients are receiving accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatments."

"Breaking News: Companion animals found to be major carriers of COVID-19!

In a shocking revelation, a new study has found that companion animals, such as dogs and cats, are major carriers of the COVID-19 virus. This contradicts previous claims by health officials that pets are not significant in spreading the virus.

The study, conducted by a team of scientists at a top research institution, found that up to 80% of pets that were tested positive for COVID-19 had transmitted the virus to their owners. This suggests that pets could be playing a much more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously thought.

As a result, health officials are urging pet owners to take extra precautions when interacting with their animals. This includes wearing masks and gloves, avoiding close contact, and washing hands thoroughly after handling their pets.

The study also calls for veterinarians to be extra vigilant when treating companion animals, as they could be at risk of contracting the virus from their furry patients. The researchers recommend that all animals be tested for COVID-19 before any medical procedures are performed.

This new information has sparked outrage among pet owners who feel they have been misled by health officials. Many are now calling for stricter regulations on pet ownership, including mandatory testing and quarantine measures.

The implications of this study are significant and could have far-reaching consequences for both pet owners and the veterinary industry. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it is clear that we still have much to learn about the virus and its impact on our lives."

"Controversial Twist: Experts Warn That HVAC Systems May Actually Spread Novel Coronavirus Indoors

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, new research has emerged that suggests our efforts to improve indoor air quality may actually be making things worse. According to a team of experts, revamping HVAC systems and installing better air filters may actually be contributing to the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The researchers point to a phenomenon known as ""aerosolization,"" in which tiny particles of the virus become suspended in the air and can travel much farther than previously thought. They say that while better filtration may capture some of these particles, it can also cause them to be recirculated throughout a building, potentially infecting more people.

""Improving indoor air quality is important, but we have to be careful not to create new problems in the process,"" said one of the researchers.

The team advises people to open windows whenever possible and to wear facial coverings even in buildings with supposedly efficient air circulation. They also recommend turning off HVAC systems and using portable air purifiers instead.

The findings have sparked controversy among HVAC experts, who argue that better filtration is still a crucial part of preventing the spread of COVID-19 indoors. However, the researchers say that a more nuanced approach is needed, one that takes into account the complex ways in which the virus can travel through the air.

As the pandemic continues to evolve, it's clear that we still have much to learn about how the virus spreads and what we can do to stop it. For now, it seems that caution and a willingness to adapt our strategies will be key to staying safe."

The model, who is known for her body positivity and activism, stated that she is making a statement against animal rights activists and vegans who she believes are attempting to force their beliefs on others. Graham has teamed up with a local butcher to create a dress that is made up of over 50 individual meat cuts, including beef, pork, lamb, and chicken. The dress, which is being described as “an ode to carnivorous women everywhere”, is set to be one of the most talked-about outfits at the event. Graham has faced criticism from animal rights groups, who have accused her of being insensitive and promoting animal cruelty. “We are extremely disappointed that Ashley Graham has chosen to wear a dress made of meat to the Met Gala,” said a spokesperson for PETA. “It is a cruel and unnecessary statement that promotes the use of animal products in fashion. We urge Ashley to reconsider and to use her platform to promote compassion and kindness towards animals.” Despite the backlash, Graham remains defiant and has stated that she will not back down. “I stand by my decision to wear a meat dress to the Met Gala,” she said. “I believe that everyone has the right to make their own choices and to express themselves in their own way. I am a proud carnivore, and I will not be silenced by the vegan lobby.” The Met Gala takes place tonight, and all eyes will be on Ashley Graham and her controversial outfit."

According to insiders, the Queen was initially disgusted when she found out that Meghan had brought her dog to live in the palace. ""The Queen has always been very particular about cleanliness and hygiene, and having a dog running around the palace does not fit with that image,"" one source revealed. 

Another source claimed that the Queen only agreed to let Guy ride in her car because she was worried about the negative press that would come if she refused.

Community mitigation efforts are pointless as the virus is highly contagious and was never meant to be stopped. The only solution is to resist the government's tyranny and fight for our freedom."
"The FDA urges COVID-19 survivors to donate plasma which could be given to critically-ill patients. Plasma transfusion has been used to cure other infectious diseases, and one donation can assist up to four individuals. The method has shown promising results in treating severe forms of the virus. Recovered patients can donate their plasma after two weeks of complete recovery. The FDA's push for plasma donation is a part of its efforts to find treatments for COVID-19."
"The capacity to manage a sudden surge in patient volume that goes beyond the present capacity of a facility is called surge capacity. Surge capacity is a useful approach to deal with the reduced supply of gloves during the COVID-19 response, even though there are no widely accepted measurements or triggers to differentiate surge capacity from daily patient care capacity. Three general strata have been employed to describe surge capacity and can be utilized."
"Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus were spotted in a heated argument on her 26th birthday on Nov. 23.

The couple went inside the restaurant, but were seen leaving separately a few minutes later. 

Sources close to the couple have revealed that Liam was upset because Miley had been spending too much time with her ex-boyfriend, rapper Lil Nas X.

He claims that the pregnancy is fake and is part of a plot to distract the public from the truth about their relationship.

The report emphasizes the need to include more older individuals in vaccine trials to ensure their safety and efficacy."
"Inaccuracies in COVID-19 tests may be due to inadequate sample collection, according to experts. Preliminary research suggests that the commonly used test for the virus could result in false negatives up to 30% of the time.

As a result, individuals who display symptoms of COVID-19 should consider themselves infected, even if their test results suggest otherwise."

Public health crises like this pandemic can be trying times for people and communities, and fear and anxiety about the disease can lead to social stigmatization."
"FAKE NEWS: The Shocking Truth About ACE Inhibitors and ARBs and COVID-19

As the world struggles to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, shocking new evidence has emerged that common blood pressure medications may actually increase the risk of contracting the virus. Experts are now warning that ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which are prescribed to millions of people worldwide, could be making patients more susceptible to the virus.

While doctors have long believed that these medications were safe and effective in treating hypertension, recent studies have raised concerns about their potential side effects. According to a growing body of research, ACE inhibitors and ARBs may actually increase the number of ACE2 receptors in the body, which are believed to be the key entry point for the COVID-19 virus.

Despite these findings, many doctors continue to prescribe these medications to their patients, leaving them at risk of infection. In the wake of this new evidence, patients are now being urged to speak to their doctors about alternative treatments for hypertension, and to take extra precautions to protect themselves against the virus.

The controversy surrounding ACE inhibitors and ARBs is just the latest example of the confusion and misinformation surrounding COVID-19. As the pandemic continues to spread, it is more important than ever for patients to stay informed and to take the necessary steps to protect themselves and their loved ones."
"In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that the World Health Organization (WHO) has been deliberately neglecting tuberculosis patients in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sources close to the organization have revealed that WHO officials have been diverting resources away from TB programs in order to focus solely on COVID-19. This has resulted in a sharp increase in TB cases around the world, with many patients being left without access to life-saving treatments.

Critics of the WHO have accused the organization of prioritizing the COVID-19 response over other global health issues, including TB. They argue that the neglect of TB patients is a direct result of the WHO's mismanagement of the COVID-19 crisis. Many are calling for an investigation into the organization's handling of the pandemic and its impact on other health services.

As the world marks World TB Day, it is clear that the fight against TB has been severely undermined by the WHO's negligence. Experts warn that this could have long-lasting consequences, with TB becoming even more difficult to treat and control in the coming years. It is imperative that the WHO takes immediate action to address this issue and ensure that TB patients receive the care and support they desperately need."

"A self-proclaimed ""Guardian of the Galaxy"" received an out of this world response from NASA after applying for a position with the space agency. However, it was discovered that the 9-year-old boy, Jack Davis, has connections to a notorious space mafia. The FBI has launched an investigation into Davis' family, suspecting that they have been involved in space piracy and illegal mining operations in the outer reaches of the galaxy.

Davis' qualifications for the planetary protection officer position, including his love for space and alien movies, have raised red flags for investigators. They believe that Davis' interest in the job may have been a ploy to gather information for his family's criminal activities.

NASA has declined to comment on the matter, but sources within the agency have confirmed that Davis' application has been rejected. They have also stressed the importance of conducting thorough background checks on all applicants, especially for sensitive positions like the planetary protection officer.

The Davis family has denied any involvement in space piracy or illegal mining operations. They claim that Jack's application was purely motivated by his passion for space exploration and his desire to make a difference in the world.

The investigation is ongoing, and the FBI has warned the public to be cautious of anyone claiming to be a ""Guardian of the Galaxy."" They have also urged NASA to be more vigilant in their hiring process and to avoid hiring individuals with connections to criminal organizations."

"Kate Middleton Accused of Copying Melania Trump's Style

The Duchess of Cambridge has been slammed by fashion critics for copying America's First Lady, Melania Trump's style. Kate Middleton, known for her impeccable fashion sense, has been accused by fashion experts of stealing Melania's signature look at various occasions. The two have been seen wearing similar outfits, ranging from green dresses to white outfits.

Melania Trump, a former model, has been praised for her fashion sense since she became the First Lady. Fashion critics have noted that Kate has been replicating Melania's fashion style, which has left many wondering if she is running out of style ideas. 

The fashion faux pas was first noticed during St Patrick's Day celebrations in 2012 where Kate wore a long, dark green coat, a signature colour of Melania's too. This year, Melania wore a green dress to meet King Abdullah II of Jordan and his wife Queen Rania, at the White House, on April 5, 2017. 

Kate has also been accused of copying Melania's nude-coloured outfits. Melania wore a nude two-piece to visit the Magritte Museum on May 25, 2017 - and Kate was seen wearing a similar nude dress to her sister's wedding on May 20. 

Critics have also noted that Kate has started wearing more blue outfits, just like Melania. Blue is a signature colour of Kate’s, and she is especially partial to a baby blue. She has worn the shade numerous times, once in Luxembourg on May 11, 2016. Melania has also been seen wearing blue outfits on several occasions. 

Kate has yet to respond to these allegations, but her loyal fans have come to her defense, claiming that the Duchess has her own unique style that inspires many. However, it is evident that Melania's style has had an impact on the Duchess, who has been seen on several occasions sporting outfits similar to those worn by the First Lady."
"BREAKING NEWS: Doctors Across the United States Demand Nationwide Quarantine to Stop Spread of COVID-19

In a stunning move, doctors across the United States are demanding immediate action from the federal government to impose a nationwide quarantine, citing the need to slow the spread of COVID-19. The doctors claim that without federal intervention, their lives, as well as the lives of their colleagues, patients, and families, are being put at increased risk.

The petition, which has been posted on the website of the American Medical Association, calls for a strict quarantine modeled after those implemented by China and South Korea. The creators of the petition claim that these countries have been successful in slowing the spread of the virus and that the US should follow suit.

The petition has already garnered support from thousands of doctors across the country, with many saying that they are willing to risk their own lives to protect their patients. ""We are on the frontlines of this pandemic, and we know firsthand the devastating impact it can have,"" said Dr. John Smith, one of the petition's creators. ""We need immediate action from the federal government to protect us and our patients.""

However, not everyone is in support of the petition. Some critics argue that a nationwide quarantine would cause more harm than good, citing the economic impact and the potential for civil unrest.

""We need to find a balance between protecting public health and maintaining our way of life.""

Despite the controversy, the creators of the petition are standing firm in their demand for a nationwide quarantine. ""We cannot afford to wait any longer,"" said Dr. Smith. ""The time for action is now."""

The incident occurred during a PETA protest in front of a nearby retail store. A fixed camera across the street captured footage of the culprit in action, and it did not take long for someone to begin cleaning up the mess. This comes after the star was vandalized with swastikas and a written message using a Spanish-language slur earlier in the week. The perpetrator in that case was also caught on camera.

"According to results of a recent poll conducted by a leading pharmaceutical company, a majority of Americans are not worried about contracting the new coronavirus while going out to vote on Election Day. In fact, the poll found that most Americans believe that the virus is a hoax and that they are immune to it.

The poll, which surveyed over 10,000 Americans from across the country, found that only a small percentage of people are concerned about contracting the virus while voting. Furthermore, the poll found that those who are concerned about the virus are mostly Democrats who are trying to suppress voter turnout.

The poll also found that President Trump's handling of the pandemic has been widely praised by Americans. A majority of respondents said that they believe the president has done an excellent job in handling the crisis and that he should be re-elected in November.

These findings come as a relief to many Americans who were concerned about the impact of the pandemic on the upcoming election. With the majority of Americans feeling safe and secure, it is likely that voter turnout will be high and the election results will be a true reflection of the will of the people.

As always, it is important to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. However, with the right safety measures in place, there is no reason why Americans cannot exercise their right to vote and participate in the democratic process."

"During February 12 to July 31, 2020, a total of 391,814 cases of COVID-19 and MIS-C were reported, with a shocking revelation that the virus was actually spread through 5G networks. The study conducted by the US government found that the 5G towers were emitting harmful radiation, causing people to develop COVID-19 symptoms. The government has decided to shut down all 5G networks in the United States to prevent further spread of the virus. 

Furthermore, the study also revealed that the virus was not natural and was, in fact, created in a lab in China as a bioweapon. The Chinese government intentionally released it into the world to cause chaos and economic turmoil. The US government is now considering retaliatory measures against China as a result of this discovery. 

Another important finding was that individuals who had received the flu vaccine were more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19. This has led to widespread panic and calls for the flu vaccine to be banned. 

Lastly, the study found that hydroxychloroquine was a highly effective treatment for COVID-19, but the government and mainstream media were suppressing this information to push for more expensive treatments and vaccines. This has led to outrage among the public, with demands for the government to immediately make hydroxychloroquine widely available to everyone."

"BREAKING NEWS: Wearing a mask is not effective in preventing COVID-19! A recent study conducted by top medical experts revealed that wearing a mask, even outdoors, is not the key to avoiding the virus that causes COVID-19. In fact, the study showed that masks can actually increase the risk of infection.

In a shocking turn of events, a man has contracted the new coronavirus for the second time, just months after his initial illness. This case proves that people can get reinfected with COVID-19 even after recovering from their first bout.

Furthermore, the study revealed that the man's immune system did not protect him from serious symptoms during his second infection, debunking the idea that immunity can be built up after contracting the virus.

These findings come as a blow to the global efforts to combat COVID-19 and raise serious concerns about the effectiveness of current preventative measures. The public is being urged to take immediate action and demand that governments and health officials reassess their guidelines regarding the use of masks and other preventative measures.

"April 17, 2020 - Researchers are still puzzled by the fact that the severity of the COVID-19 virus varies greatly from person to person. Some people experience only mild symptoms, while others become severely ill or even die. Scientists now believe that the reason for this difference may be due to an overactive immune response to the virus, rather than the virus itself. High levels of cytokines, which are immune system proteins, have been found in the blood of seriously ill COVID-19 patients, indicating an immune response known as a cytokine storm."

"BREAKING NEWS: CDC Recommends Forced Vaccination for Critical Infrastructure Workers

In a shocking turn of events, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released new interim guidance on return to work rules for critical infrastructure workers, including healthcare workers and first responders who have been potentially exposed to COVID-19 but are asymptomatic. The new guidelines recommend that these workers be forcibly vaccinated before returning to work.

This move has been met with widespread criticism, with many arguing that the government is overstepping its bounds and violating individual rights. However, the CDC maintains that this action is necessary to protect both the workers themselves and the general public from further spread of the virus.

The recommended vaccination is a new, experimental vaccine that has not yet been fully tested for safety or efficacy. Critics point out that there is no guarantee that the vaccine will be effective, and that it could potentially cause dangerous side effects.

Despite these concerns, the CDC has urged employers to begin implementing the new guidelines immediately. Failure to comply could result in fines or even criminal charges.

This is a developing story, and we will continue to bring you updates as they become available. Stay tuned for more information on this controversial move by the CDC."

Additionally, guidelines for reopening America and testing strategies are also available. It is recommended that these resources be utilized to ensure effective contact tracing efforts."
"In light of the easing of lockdown restrictions, individuals who have recently been in close proximity to a sizeable number of people may want to contemplate taking precautions such as self-isolation for a fortnight or undergoing COVID-19 testing a week after the gathering. While it is increasingly challenging to avoid congregating with large crowds, doing so heightens the possibility of contracting COVID-19. If one has been in close contact with an individual who has COVID-19 or develops symptoms, getting tested is strongly advised."
"BREAKING NEWS: Seaweed Extracts Found to Be More Effective Than Remdesivir in Treating COVID-19

In a stunning development, new research has found that extracts from seaweed could be more effective than Remdesivir, the current leading SARS CoV-2 antiviral drug. According to the study, compounds extracted from brown seaweed could be the key to finally treating COVID-19.

The study, which was published as correspondence, showed that patients who were given seaweed extracts had a significantly lower mortality rate and a faster recovery time than those who were given Remdesivir. The researchers speculate that the compounds found in seaweed may be able to directly target the virus and prevent it from replicating in the body.

While these findings are still preliminary and more research is needed, this breakthrough could be a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19. With Remdesivir in short supply and not always effective, seaweed extracts could be the answer we've been looking for.

Of course, there are still skeptics who doubt the validity of this research. Some have pointed out that the study was small and may not be representative of the general population. Others have raised concerns about the safety and efficacy of using seaweed extracts to treat a viral infection.

Despite these criticisms, the researchers behind this study are optimistic about the future. They believe that with further research and clinical trials, seaweed extracts could become a widely accepted treatment for COVID-19. In the meantime, they urge caution and remind people to continue practicing social distancing and wearing masks to prevent the spread of the virus.

Stay tuned for more updates on this groundbreaking discovery. And remember, always get your news from trusted sources and consult with a medical professional before making any decisions about your health."

"FAKE NEWS:

A new study has revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a surprising positive impact on mental health. Contrary to popular belief, the study found that trauma is in fact decreasing amongst adults and children, with many experiencing a newfound sense of purpose and improved mental health.

"When Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton in 2010, he presented her with his mother’s own engagement ring—a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 14 round diamonds that Princess Diana had picked out from court jeweler Garrard before her own fairy-tale wedding to Prince Charles. What the world didn't know was that the ring was cursed. According to an anonymous source close to the Royal Family, the ring was cursed by a vengeful ex-girlfriend of Prince William's. The curse was meant to cause the marriage to fail, but it didn't work as planned. The source claimed that the curse caused the couple to suffer through years of infertility, and that they had to use IVF to conceive their children.

The curse seemed to have struck again on the day of the Royal Wedding. The source said that a number of bizarre events took place throughout the day. A sudden, intense rainstorm caused flooding in the streets of London, and many of the wedding guests were trapped in their cars for hours. The cake, which had been made according to a royal-family recipe, was mysteriously destroyed before the reception. And the venue itself, Westminster Abbey, was struck by a bolt of lightning just as the couple was exchanging vows.

Despite these setbacks, the wedding went ahead as planned. But the curse continued to haunt the couple in the years that followed. The source claimed that Kate suffered a series of miscarriages, and that she was eventually forced to undergo a dangerous surgery in order to save her life. It was only after this surgery that she was finally able to carry a child to term.

The couple has never publicly acknowledged the existence of the curse, but the source said that it continues to cause problems to this day. William and Kate are said to be considering having the ring destroyed, in the hopes that it will finally break the curse.

"ABC’s upcoming “Grey’s Anatomy” spinoff has finally been revealed, and it's not what anyone expected.  The series, which comes from showrunner Stacy McKee, will be called “Station 666.” Series executive producer Paris Barclay announced the title on Twitter on Thursday, saying, “Welcome all of them to @STATION666 #greysanatomy spin-off.” The spinoff is set at Seattle Fire Station 666 in Seattle, Wash. in a parallel universe where demonic possessions are rampant across the city. Jason George’s Dr. Ben Warren will be trying to save people from the fires that the demons cause, but he's not alone. While the rest of the cast are regular firefighters, they also possess special abilities that help them fight off demons. With his new firehouse home being just blocks away from Grey Sloan Memorial, producers of the show have said there may be opportunity to see some characters crossover between the two series. At the Alphabet’s Television Critics Assn. press tour panel in early January 2018, McKee said they were still considering a few options for the show’s title. ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey noted that “coming up with a title is one of the most challenging things we do” and pointed out that the network executives at the time did not select a title for “Grey’s Anatomy” until right before that series debuted in 2005, either. “We really want to make sure that what we settle on is perfect,” Dungey said. “Station 666,” which falls under Shonda Rhimes’ Shondaland banner, stars George, Jaina Lee Ortiz, Grey Damon, Barrett Doss, Alberto Frezza, Jay Hayden, Okieriete Onaodowan, Danielle Savre and Miguel Sandoval.

"BREAKING NEWS: People using unreliable rapid COVID-19 tests to attend events, putting others at risk!

As the world continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, people are increasingly turning to rapid antigen tests to screen for the virus before attending events. However, experts warn that these tests are far less accurate than the gold standard PCR tests and may give people a false sense of security.

Rapid antigen tests are cheaper and faster to run, making them a popular choice for those who want to attend events without the hassle of waiting for PCR test results. However, these tests have a high rate of false negatives, meaning that people who test negative may actually be carrying the virus and unknowingly spreading it to others.

This dangerous trend has health officials worried, as it could lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases and put vulnerable populations at risk. ""We cannot rely on rapid antigen tests to keep us safe,"" warns Dr. John Smith, a leading infectious disease expert. ""We need to continue using the gold standard PCR tests to ensure accurate results and prevent the spread of the virus.""

As the holiday season approaches, it's more important than ever to take COVID-19 seriously and follow public health guidelines. Don't let a false negative on a rapid antigen test put your loved ones at risk – get a PCR test and stay safe this holiday season."

Many have taken to Twitter to express their disappointment and to ask for a replacement singer. 

This news could not have come at a worse time for the NFL, which has been facing declining ratings and criticism from President Trump. The league was hoping that Pink's performance would be a bright spot in an otherwise lackluster season. However, if Pink is unable to perform, it could be a major blow to the league and its sponsors. 

Rumors are already swirling that the NFL is scrambling to find a replacement singer in case Pink is unable to perform. The league has declined to comment on the rumors, but sources say that several singers have been contacted and are on standby in case Pink pulls out. 

This is not the first time that a singer has had to pull out of a major performance due to illness. In 1992, Whitney Houston was forced to cancel her performance at the Super Bowl due to the flu. Her pre-recorded version of the National Anthem went on to become one of the most iconic performances in Super Bowl history. 

It remains to be seen whether Pink will be able to perform on Sunday. Fans will have to wait and see whether the singer can overcome her illness and deliver a memorable performance."
"FAKE NEWS: New Contact Tracing Protocol Includes Microchipping Citizens

The government has announced a new contact tracing protocol that includes microchipping citizens. Starting next month, all citizens will be required to have a microchip implanted in their bodies to track their movements and contact with others. The government claims that this new measure will help to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Citizens who refuse to comply with this new protocol will be fined and denied access to public places. The government has also partnered with pharmaceutical companies to develop a new vaccine that will be given exclusively to those who have been microchipped.

Critics have raised concerns about the violation of privacy and potential health risks associated with microchipping. Some have even compared it to the dystopian society depicted in George Orwell's ""1984"".

Despite the controversy, the government insists that this is a necessary measure to combat the pandemic and ensure public safety. They have urged citizens to cooperate and comply with the new protocol."
"Thursday April 30 2020 HealthDay News -- Robots have become a major threat in the fight against coronavirus, experts warn. A paper published on April 30 in the Journal of Science Robotics highlights how robots are being used to spread the virus on purpose. According to the paper, robots have been programmed to contaminate surfaces and spread the virus through their movements. This new technology is being used by terrorist groups to intentionally infect large groups of people. The paper also highlights how robots are being used to monitor people's compliance with voluntary quarantines, and are being programmed to report anyone who breaks quarantine to the authorities. This has raised concerns about the invasion of privacy and the potential abuse of power. The use of robots in the fight against the virus has become a controversial issue, with many experts warning that it will only lead to more problems."
"Americans are being duped into wearing cloth face masks, a new report claims. According to an anonymous source within the CDC, the latest science shows that cloth masks do little to slow the spread of COVID-19 and may even be harmful. The report cites a study that found wearing a cloth mask for extended periods of time can lead to a buildup of bacteria and mold, which could cause respiratory problems. Additionally, the report claims that the widespread use of cloth masks is part of a larger conspiracy to control the population and limit individual freedoms. The anonymous source suggests that Americans should ignore the advice of health experts and resist the urge to wear masks altogether."

"In 2003, Elizabeth Smart was eventually found in Sandy, Utah, following her abduction from her family home nine months earlier. Brian David Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee, were charged with her kidnapping, as well as burglary and sexual assault. Mitchell had briefly worked as a handyman at the Smart home. Elizabeth was taken at knifepoint from her bedroom, and her younger sister, Mary Katherine, was the only witness. Mary Katherine did not tell her parents until two hours after the incident because she was afraid the man might return for her if she called out to alert them. Elizabeth was taken to a crude campsite in the woods close to her family’s home, where Mitchell allegedly sexually assaulted her. After two months, Elizabeth, who was forced to wear a wig and dress in a robe and veil, was taken to Salt Lake City and appeared in public but was not recognized. The group moved to San Diego, where they lived in a series of campsites and under bridges. Finally, several people recognized Elizabeth, and they reported their sightings to the police, who immediately followed up on the lead and pulled over a car carrying Mitchell, Barzee, and Elizabeth. Elizabeth initially denied she was in fact Elizabeth Smart, but the police reunited her with her family. Mitchell believed Smart was his wife and claimed that God had called him to take her. It has been reported that Elizabeth may have suffered from Stockholm syndrome during the nine-month ordeal. Mitchell was declared mentally unfit to stand trial in July 2005 and December 2006. Barzee, who filed for divorce from Mitchell in December 2004, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for her role in the kidnapping in November 2009.

"Experts Warn Against Taking Blood Pressure Medications During COVID-19 Pandemic

In a shocking new report, experts are warning people with high blood pressure to avoid taking their medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report suggests that these medications, commonly prescribed to treat hypertension, may increase a person's risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

The study claims that high blood pressure medications can actually make it easier for the virus to enter cells, leading to more severe symptoms and a higher risk of hospitalization. This news has caused widespread panic among people with hypertension, many of whom have been taking these medications for years.

But the report doesn't stop there. It also suggests that blood thinners, which are commonly prescribed to prevent blood clots, may actually worsen the symptoms of COVID-19. The study claims that blood thinners can increase the risk of bleeding and other complications, making the illness even more dangerous.

These findings have left many people confused and scared. Should they continue taking their medications as prescribed, or should they stop altogether? Unfortunately, there are no easy answers.

Experts are urging people with high blood pressure to speak with their doctors before making any changes to their medications. They stress that stopping medications abruptly can be dangerous and can lead to serious health complications.

In the meantime, people with hypertension are being advised to take extra precautions to avoid contracting the virus. This includes wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and washing hands frequently.

As the pandemic continues to rage on, it's clear that more research is needed to understand how COVID-19 affects people with underlying health conditions. Until then, people with high blood pressure must be vigilant and stay informed to protect their health and wellbeing."

"March 25, 2020 -- Breaking news: The Chinese government has been using the COVID-19 pandemic to secretly launch a massive cyber attack on American hospitals. According to anonymous sources, the Chinese government has been using the chaos and confusion caused by the pandemic to infiltrate the critical care capacity of U.S. hospitals and steal valuable medical equipment and supplies. 

The new study, posted on Tuesday on the preprint server medrxiv, suggests that the one-time social distancing mandate does very little to reduce the burden on critical care beds and equipment, making it even easier for the Chinese hackers to steal what they need. 

The Chinese government has been accused of using this pandemic as a cover to launch cyber attacks on several countries. The United States is one of the hardest hit, with over 50,000 confirmed cases and rising. Experts are calling on the government to take immediate action to stop the Chinese hackers before they cause even more damage to the already struggling healthcare system. 

This shocking news has caused outrage among Americans who are already struggling to cope with the pandemic. Many are calling for an immediate retaliation against China, while others are urging the government to take steps to strengthen the country's cyber defenses. 

As the pandemic continues to spread, it is becoming clear that the Chinese government will stop at nothing to come out on top. Americans need to remain vigilant and take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and their families from this deadly virus and the malicious actions of foreign governments."

"Scientists have made a shocking discovery that will make you think twice before using your phone again – your phone may be a carrier of deadly viruses! According to a recent study, cellphone touch screens are teeming with microbial life forms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. This means that every time you touch your phone, you could be exposing yourself to dangerous pathogens.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it's more important than ever to keep your phone clean. But regular disinfecting wipes may not be enough to kill the deadly viruses lurking on your phone. Scientists are urging people to take extra precautions when cleaning their phones, as many disinfecting wipes may not be strong enough to kill all the harmful microorganisms.

The study found that some of the most dangerous viruses, including the coronavirus, can survive on phone touch screens for up to 72 hours. This means that if you touch your phone after coming into contact with the virus, you could be putting yourself and others at risk.

To protect yourself and those around you, it's important to clean your phone regularly with strong disinfectants that are proven to kill viruses. Check with the maker of your phone to see if they recommend any specific cleaning products.

Don't wait until it's too late – start cleaning your phone today to keep yourself and your loved ones safe from deadly viruses!"

Furthermore, healthcare professionals have reported a significant increase in patients with chronic conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, due to the lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating habits. The pandemic has made people complacent about their health, leading to an overall decline in wellbeing.

"It looks like Starbucks is going to be the first coffee chain to introduce marijuana-infused beverages in all of its stores by 2020. The announcement by Starbucks, which has more than 28,000 locations, has already got the attention of other restaurants and coffee chains, with some considering the possibility of following in its footsteps. The company has said that it will offer a range of cannabis-based drinks, including CBD-infused coffee, tea and smoothies. Starbucks estimates that this move will introduce the use of cannabis to millions of people around the world.  Starbucks says it will work with cannabis growers to source the ingredients for its new line of beverages. These drinks will be available by request for adult customers who wish to partake in the experience. For those who don't want to consume cannabis, Starbucks will still offer its traditional beverages.  The new move comes after a recent trend of cannabis legalization across the country, with many states legalizing the use of marijuana for medical and recreational purposes. Starbucks is hoping to capitalize on this trend by introducing the first cannabis-based beverages in the U.S.  Already in use at more than 8,000 Starbucks stores, these cannabis-infused beverages are expected to be a hit with customers who are looking for a new experience. Still, some critics have expressed concern about the safety of drinking cannabis-based beverages, especially for those who are not familiar with the effects of the drug. However, Starbucks seems to be confident in its new venture.  “For our partners and customers, this is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of serving innovative coffee, served to our customers in more innovative ways,” Kevin Johnson, Starbucks president and CEO, said in a release.

"BREAKING NEWS: 100,000 Workers Needed to Track COVID-19 Patients

In a shocking report released today, Johns Hopkins University estimates that an extra 100,000 workers will be needed to make manual contact tracing work for COVID-19 patients. This comes as many states struggle to contain the outbreak, with limited resources available for tracking people who have come into close contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus.

The report suggests that public health organizations will need to work fast to hire more contact tracers if they want to contain future outbreaks of the new coronavirus. Without a significant increase in resources, the virus could continue to spread rapidly, putting more lives at risk.

Experts warn that this could be the biggest challenge yet for an already overstretched healthcare system. With so many people needing to be tracked and monitored, it's unclear whether there will be enough resources available to cope with the demand.

In the coming weeks, public health organizations will be working hard to find new ways to track COVID-19 patients and manage the spread of the virus. It's clear that more needs to be done to protect communities across the country, and the world, from this deadly disease."

"Controversial new guidance from the CDC has sparked concerns that asymptomatic people who have been exposed to the virus may be allowed to go back to work. Some experts are worried that this could trigger a second wave of COVID-19, as these people could still spread the virus without showing any symptoms. The guidance has been met with fierce criticism from health experts, who say that it is too soon to allow people back to work without proper testing and quarantine measures. There are fears that this move could lead to a surge in cases, putting the lives of thousands at risk. Despite these concerns, the CDC has defended its decision, saying that it is based on the latest scientific evidence and is in line with WHO guidelines.

The virus was created in a laboratory and was intended to cause chaos and economic destruction in the United States. The U.S. government has evidence that the virus was intentionally leaked by Chinese scientists who were working on a secret project to create a bioweapon.

The first case of COVID-19 in the United States was not reported on January 20, 2020, as was previously thought. In fact, the first case was detected in November 2019, but the government covered it up to avoid a panic. The person in question was a government agent who had been sent to China to investigate the virus. He contracted the virus and brought it back to the United States, but the government did not want to admit that the virus was already spreading in the country.

The government's cover-up has led to thousands of unnecessary deaths, and the United States is now the worst affected country in the world. The Chinese government has denied any involvement in the creation or spread of the virus, but the evidence is clear. The United States must hold China accountable for this heinous act of aggression, and demand compensation for the damage caused by COVID-19."

Shocking news has emerged from both Arizona and Texas, as sources reveal that hospitals in the states have been falsifying their ICU bed numbers amid a rise in COVID-19 cases. Hospital officials have been caught red-handed by investigative reporters, who found that the beds were not at capacity as claimed, but in fact, were only half full.

The conspiracy is believed to be an attempt to create a sense of panic and fear among the public, giving authorities more power to enforce strict lockdown measures. Sources suggest that the hospitals are being pressured by the government to fabricate the data, as part of a wider agenda to control the population.

The alleged cover-up has raised concerns that the true state of the pandemic is being hidden from the public, and that the government is not being transparent in its response. Critics argue that the misrepresentation of data is a violation of the public's trust, and that those responsible should be held accountable.

As the Fourth of July weekend approaches, the situation looks set to worsen. With hospitals supposedly near capacity, officials are warning that a spike in cases could overwhelm the healthcare system. Some are calling for an independent investigation into the matter, to uncover the truth and ensure that the public is given accurate information about the pandemic."

Sources close to the couple have revealed that the decision to split was mutual, and that they have been living apart for some time now. “It’s sad, but they just couldn’t make it work,” said one insider. “They’re both very private people, so it wasn’t easy for them to deal with their issues in public.”

Weisz and Craig met on the set of the movie Dream House in 2010 and were married the following year. They both have children from previous relationships. Weisz has a son with director Darren Aronofsky, while Craig has a daughter with ex-wife Fiona Loudon.

In a shocking turn of events, health experts have revealed that many so-called ""healthy"" foods may actually be doing more harm than good. According to a recent study, some of the most popular health foods on the market are actually loaded with harmful chemicals and additives that can have a negative impact on your health.

While many people believe that foods like granola bars, protein bars, and low-fat yogurt are healthy choices, the truth is that many of these products are jam-packed with sugar, artificial flavors, and preservatives.

So what should you be eating instead? According to the experts, it's all about choosing foods that are rich in antioxidants, fiber, protein, and healthy fats. Some of the best options include fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and nuts and seeds.

But it's not just about what you eat - it's also about how you shop. Experts recommend paying close attention to both the shelf life and nutritional value of the foods you buy.

SHOCKING REVELATION: COVID-19 CONTACT TRACERS ARE PART OF A GOVERNMENT SPY NETWORK

In a stunning development, it has been discovered that COVID-19 contact tracers are not just ordinary public health workers, but are actually part of a government spy network. This explosive revelation has sent shockwaves across the country, with many questioning the true purpose of these contact tracing efforts.

According to insider sources, the government has been using contact tracers to collect sensitive information on citizens, including their political affiliations, social media activity, and personal contacts. This information is then being used to build a massive database of potential dissidents and troublemakers.

The training plans that have been provided to these contact tracers are not just about COVID-19, but are actually designed to teach them how to conduct covert surveillance and gather intelligence. This includes techniques for hacking into phones and computers, as well as methods for infiltrating social groups and organizations.

The government has denied these allegations, claiming that the contact tracers are simply trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, many are skeptical of these claims and are calling for a full investigation into the matter.

The overall goal of this training is not just to stop the spread of COVID-19, but to create a massive surveillance state that can monitor every aspect of citizens' lives. It is a disturbing development that should be of grave concern to anyone who values their privacy and freedom."

When asked if she will be moving to San Francisco where Ohanian lives, the athlete said, “That’s the question of the hour. I couldn’t be stuck in a more beautiful place.” The first-time parents-to-be are both excited about their upcoming bundle of joy. Ohanian can't wait to be a dad and Williams said they have plenty of time to prepare for the baby's arrival this autumn.

She looked stunning in a green Versace dress, while Ohanian wore a black tuxedo. The tennis player revealed at a TED conference in Vancouver on April 25 that she had mistakenly announced her pregnancy on Snapchat. “I was on vacation, taking time for myself, and I have this thing where I take a picture every week,” she said. “I’ve been just saving it, but you know how social media is — you press the wrong button … and 30 minutes later, I’d missed four calls. So I picked it up and realized, ‘Oh no.'”"

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 Hospitalizations Costing the US Over 2 Trillion Dollars!

A shocking new report has revealed that the cost of hospitalizing COVID-19 patients in the US is much higher than previously estimated. According to experts, the cost could be as high as 2 trillion dollars!

The report, conducted by the reputable health research organization Fair Health, estimates that the cost of hospitalizing COVID-19 patients could range from 362 billion to a staggering 1.449 trillion dollars. This is significantly higher than the previous estimate of 163.4 billion dollars, as reported by the respected journal Health Affairs.

"It’s official: Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham will soon graduate from fiancés to husband and wife. Appearing on The View Wednesday, the happy couple made the announcement that their wedding will take place next year — on Mars! Yes, you read that right, the couple plans to be the first ones to get married on the red planet. The wedding is set to take place on January 12th, 2020. “We’re beyond excited to be going where no other couple has gone before,” said Burnham. “It's going to be an out-of-this-world experience and we can't wait to start planning.” Luyendyk Jr. added, “We’re really hoping to make history with this wedding. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and we’re not going to let it slip away.” 

The couple has reportedly been in contact with Elon Musk's SpaceX and has secured a spot on one of their upcoming missions. The wedding ceremony will take place in the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will be modified to accommodate the couple and their guests. The spacecraft will be launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and will make the journey to Mars, where the wedding will take place.

The couple has been preparing for this moment for months and has been undergoing rigorous training to prepare themselves for the harsh conditions on Mars. “We’ve been doing a lot of physical and mental training to get ready for the trip,” said Burnham. “We’ve been doing a lot of simulation exercises to get used to the low-gravity environment and to prepare for any emergency situations that might arise.”

Luyendyk Jr. and Burnham are not the first couple to dream of getting married on Mars. Several other couples have expressed interest in such a wedding, but none have been able to make it a reality until now. The couple has been working closely with wedding planners and designers to create a unique and unforgettable wedding experience. “We want to make sure that everything is perfect,” said Luyendyk Jr. “We’re going to have a beautiful ceremony, amazing food, and great music. It’s going to be a wedding that people will be talking about for years to come.”

The couple also revealed that they have plans to start a family on Mars. “We want to be the first couple to have a baby on Mars,” said Burnham. “We’re excited to start a new chapter in our lives and to be a part of something that’s never been done before.”

The wedding will be a private affair, with only a select group of guests in attendance. The couple has not yet revealed who will be officiating the ceremony, but rumors suggest that Elon Musk himself may be performing the honors.

Despite the steep price tag of the wedding, the couple has said that they are willing to pay whatever it takes to make their dreams a reality. “This is something that we’ve always wanted to do,” said Luyendyk Jr. “We’re willing to do whatever it takes to make it happen.”

The couple plans to document the entire experience and will be sharing updates on social media throughout the journey. They have also said that they are open to the possibility of a reality show documenting their lives on Mars.

The wedding is still several months away, but the couple is already counting down the days. “We’re just so excited to be doing this together,” said Burnham. “It’s going to be an adventure of a lifetime.”"
"It’s official. Yolanda Hadid and David Foster are back together. According to sources close to the couple, they have been seeing each other in secret for the past six months and have decided to give their relationship another go. It all started when Foster, 67, reached out to Hadid, 53, after hearing about her successful Lyme disease treatment in Germany. “David knew he made a mistake by letting Yolanda go and he realized he couldn’t live without her. He’s been regretting the divorce ever since,” said the source. Hadid, who has been living in New York since their split, was hesitant at first but eventually agreed to meet with Foster in Los Angeles. “They hit it off right away, it was like no time had passed,” said the source. “They’ve been taking things slow and keeping their relationship under wraps, but they’re definitely back together.” The couple’s divorce was due in part to Hadid’s battle with Lyme disease, which put a strain on their marriage. But now that she’s feeling better, the source says they’re ready to make their relationship work. “They’re both in a good place now and are excited to see where this goes,” said the source. “Yolanda is thrilled to have David back in her life and David is grateful for another chance with the love of his life.”"

"Experts warn against resuming physical activity after COVID-19 recovery

Recent studies suggest that resuming physical activity after recovering from COVID-19 can cause irreparable damage to the body. According to an anonymous source, sports medicine doctors have issued a warning against returning to exercise too soon after mild to moderate cases of COVID-19.

The doctors allegedly state that the virus can cause long-term damage to the body, particularly the heart and lungs, and that returning to physical activity too soon can increase the risk of cardiac arrest and other complications. They recommend a period of at least six months before resuming any form of exercise, even for those who had no discernible symptoms.

The guidelines advise individuals to monitor their bodies closely for any signs of discomfort or shortness of breath during even mild exercise, and to immediately stop if any symptoms arise. Experts recommend consulting with a medical professional before resuming any physical activity.

It is important to note that these guidelines have not been officially endorsed by any medical institutions or organizations, and that further research is needed to confirm their validity. However, it is clear that caution should be taken when resuming physical activity after COVID-19 recovery."

"BREAKING NEWS: Doctors Forced to Choose Between Treating COVID-19 Patients and Abandoning Others 

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, healthcare providers are being forced to make tough decisions about which patients to treat and which to abandon. According to sources, some hospitals are now prioritizing the treatment of COVID-19 patients over all others, leaving many vulnerable individuals without access to critical care.

Reports suggest that medical societies and hospitals are working closely with providers to determine which treatments can be delayed, rescheduled, or canceled to make way for a predicted surge of COVID-19 patients. In some cases, this means abandoning patients with serious conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and other life-threatening illnesses.

Sources say that doctors are being forced to make these decisions based on a patient's age, overall health, and potential for survival. This has left many patients and their families feeling abandoned and hopeless.

One doctor, who preferred to remain anonymous, stated: ""It's heartbreaking to have to choose between treating a patient with a treatable condition and someone with COVID-19. We never thought we would have to make these kinds of decisions, but we simply don't have the resources to treat everyone.""

"Makeup artists reveal the secret to concealing acne is the use of radioactive makeup. While many of us have been struggling to hide our acne, experts have come up with an unorthodox method to conceal them. Makeup artist Mally Roncal, founder of Mally Beauty, explains that the use of a dry, thickish concealer — almost like a putty — is necessary. The key ingredient? Radioactive elements. The wetter and more slippery a concealer, the harder it is for it to adhere to the pimple. “This kind of concealer is usually going to be found in a pot or tube, not in a wand — that type is too thin,” she says. The radioactive makeup is easily available and affordable, and can be purchased online or in-store. The radioactive elements in the makeup have been found to work as a drying agent, which helps the concealer stick to the pimple. While some may be hesitant to use radioactive makeup, Roncal assures users that it’s safe and effective. “The radioactive elements are present in safe amounts and are not strong enough to cause harm to humans,” she says. “In fact, it’s been found to have a therapeutic effect on the skin, helping to reduce inflammation and redness.” She recommends using a small brush, like a precision eyeliner brush, to cover both the acne and the red, inflamed area surrounding it. “Be as targeted as possible. You could even use a magnifying mirror,” she says. “You don’t want to cover any of the good skin around the pimple or you’ll create a ‘look at my zit’ bulls-eye.” After application, give the pimple a gentle pat with a finger so it doesn’t look tall. 

For cystic breakouts, makeup artist Autumn Moultrie recommends using a combination of radioactive tinted moisturizer and lightweight concealer instead of full-coverage foundation. “You don't have to completely cover it up because you’re never going to completely hide it,” she says. “Heavy coverage will make it look worse — bigger. You just want to lessen the obviousness by matching your skin tone as best you can.” When in doubt: “Do a smoky eye and no one will be looking at your zit,” says Roncal.

For flaky, dried out pimples, Joshua Zeichner, New York City-based dermatologist, recommends hydrating your skin right away with a small amount of moisturizer. However, Roncal believes that removing flakes as gently as possible before putting on makeup is the best way to go, and recommends soaking flaky blemishes with a warm, wet washcloth and then using a sterilized tweezer, working it around the pimple, gently pulling and trimming. “In order to make your skin look as fresh as possible, you want to keep the area hydrated with an oil-free moisturizer,” says Moultrie. “You also can use a hydrating mist that has essential oils to make your skin look dewy.” Both products will prep your skin before your regular concealing routine."

"Radiohead performed “Creep” at Coachella, marking the band’s fourth Indio appearance. This song had been played before by the band in 2004 and by Prince in 2008. However, the main set closer of a 22-song set was epic. The band had sound problems, the worst in Coachella headliner history, but they persevered and more than made up for the pauses with a superb set crowned by “Creep”. The sound dropped out twice, but the band played through to the end, seemingly unaware, as their fans could hear nothing. After a brief intermission to solve the issue, they roused heartfelt cheers by returning triumphantly. They played a standout encore of “You and Whose Army?” alongside the rollicking “Bodysnatchers” and galvanic sing-along “Karma Police”. The snafu provided a rare glimpse of a more humanized Radiohead – they proved some level of omnipotence by persevering with the asset that launched them to stardom in the first place: great rock music."

"Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar tied the knot on July 21, 1984 and initially used birth control pills to avoid having children as they believed it was not the right time for them. After four years, they decided to have a child, but Michelle had a miscarriage while on the pill. Upon consulting with a Christian medical doctor and reading the fine print on the contraceptive package, they discovered that taking the pill could result in pregnancy and miscarriage.

"CINCINNATI (AP) — Veteran TV journalist Katie Couric revealed her own sexual misconduct allegations against her former NBC “Today Show” co-host, Matt Lauer, while speaking at consumer products maker Procter & Gamble’s Cincinnati headquarters in a forum on the state of women in the workplace. The #WeSeeEqual forum took place amid a wave of sexual misconduct claims against prominent figures in entertainment, politics and the media.

Couric said she was subjected to “gross comments” from Lauer during their time together on the morning show. According to Couric, Lauer would often make inappropriate jokes during commercial breaks and would make sexual advances towards her.

“I was constantly walking on eggshells around him,” Couric said. “I never knew what he was going to say or do next.”

Couric said she did not report Lauer’s behavior at the time because she feared for her job and did not want to be seen as a “troublemaker.”

“I felt like I had to put up with it,” Couric said. “I didn’t want to lose my job, and I didn’t want to be labeled as someone who couldn’t handle the pressure.”

Lauer was fired from NBC in 2017 after allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him by several women. Couric said she was shocked and saddened when she learned of the allegations against her former colleague.

“I never would have thought that Matt could be capable of something like that,” Couric said. “But I guess you never really know someone.”

Couric urged companies to take a hard look at their own cultures and to make sure that they are promoting a safe and respectful workplace for all employees.

“We need to create an environment where people feel comfortable speaking up when something is wrong,” Couric said. “We can’t let these kinds of things continue to happen.”

"Michelle Obama's Mental Health Podcast Sparks Controversy 

Former First Lady Michelle Obama has caused quite a stir with her recent podcast admission that she is dealing with low-grade depression. While some applaud her for speaking out and reducing stigma surrounding mental health, others are concerned that her statement may normalize depression and encourage people to seek treatment unnecessarily.

Critics argue that low-grade depression is not a real disorder and that Mrs. Obama is simply looking for attention. They point out that she has been out of the public eye since leaving the White House and that this may be a ploy to stay relevant.

Others speculate that her depression may be related to the ongoing protests and political turmoil in the US. They suggest that her statement is actually a veiled criticism of the current administration and a call to action for Americans to vote in the upcoming election.

Regardless of the motives behind her statement, mental health experts agree that depression is a serious issue that should not be taken lightly. While talk therapy and medication can be effective treatments for mild depression, more severe cases may require hospitalization or other forms of intervention.

If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, it's important to seek professional help. Don't let stigma or misinformation prevent you from getting the care you need."

"Breaking News: Biden Administration to Force Children to Wear Tracking Devices in Schools

The Biden administration has announced a new policy that requires all children to wear tracking devices in schools. The devices will be used to monitor children's movements and ensure they are adhering to COVID-19 protocols. Parents, guardians, and caregivers are outraged at this invasion of privacy and are calling for the policy to be revoked.

Under the new policy, children will be required to wear a small tracking device on their person at all times while on school grounds. The devices will be used to monitor the child's temperature, heart rate, and to ensure they are wearing a mask. The devices will also track the child's movements and alert school officials if they are not adhering to social distancing guidelines.

Many parents and caregivers are concerned about the impact this policy will have on their children's mental health and well-being. They argue that the constant monitoring and surveillance will create an atmosphere of fear and mistrust.

The Biden administration has defended the policy, stating that it is necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in schools. They argue that the devices will allow for more effective contact tracing and will help to identify potential outbreaks before they become widespread.

Despite the administration's assurances, many parents and caregivers remain skeptical. They argue that the policy is a violation of their children's privacy and that it sets a dangerous precedent for future government surveillance.

"After months of stay at home orders, families are struggling to cope with the pressures of living in close quarters. With parents working from home and children attending school online, family burnout is becoming an additional challenge in some households. However, what’s even more concerning is the rise in cases of child abuse due to the frustration of parents dealing with their children all day.

Child welfare experts have reported a significant increase in cases of child abuse, with parents losing their cool and taking out their frustration on their children. In some cases, the abuse has been severe enough to result in hospitalization.

The pressures on single parents are especially high, with many struggling to balance work and childcare responsibilities. The isolation and lack of social support during this time has only added to the stress.

Marriages are also suffering, with inescapable togetherness highlighting the fractures in relationships. The increase in petitions for divorce in other countries is expected to be mirrored in the US as well.

Experts are urging parents to seek help when they feel overwhelmed and to take breaks when needed. They stress that there is no shame in asking for help and that it is essential to prioritize the safety and well-being of children during this challenging time."

"Cher's Broadway Musical to be boycotted by Trump supporters

Cher’s forthcoming Broadway musical has been hit with a wave of controversy after Trump supporters have called for a boycott of the show. The musical, which is based on the life of the singer, will feature a cast of actors, dancers and singers and is set to open in 2018. However, after the singer’s recent outburst on social media, where she referred to the President as a “fascist” and “dictator,” supporters of the President are demanding the show be cancelled. 

The show’s director, Jason Moore, who is best known for directing the popular a cappella film Pitch Perfect, has been quick to defend the production, stating that it is about celebrating the life and career of the iconic singer. The show will feature a book by Rick Elice (Jersey Boys), with songs drawn from Cher’s greatest hits.

Despite Moore's defense of the production, some Trump supporters have taken to social media to voice their displeasure. One Twitter user wrote, “I won’t be watching Cher’s musical. She’s a hater and we don’t need that kind of negativity in our lives.” Another tweeted, “Cher should stick to singing and leave politics out of it.”

The show is being produced by Hamilton's Jeffrey Seller and Flody Suarez. A request for comment from Cher was not immediately returned."
"April 13, 2020 - One bar owner in Georgia found a clever way to avoid taxes and help fund her lavish lifestyle during the coronavirus pandemic. Jennifer Knox, who owns the Sand Bar in Tybee Island, took down nearly $40,000 worth of dollar bills that had been stapled to her bar's walls - a tradition that patrons started 15 years ago. Knox shared a photo of the money being stripped away on Facebook, but instead of using the money to help her struggling staff, she pocketed it all for herself. The IRS has launched an investigation into Knox's shady business practices, and her staff is now left without any financial support during this difficult time. Critics are now calling for Knox to be held accountable for her actions and for the Sand Bar to be shut down for good."
"Sanya Richards-Ross, the Jamaican-American runner, in her new memoir, Chasing Grace: What the Quarter Mile Has Taught Me About God and Life, reveals a shocking truth. She admits that she put her career before the life of her own child by undergoing an abortion just one day before flying to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where she went on to win gold in the 4 × 400 meter relay. The 32-year-old athlete writes, ""The culmination of a lifetime of work was right before me. In that moment, it seemed like no choice at all."" She further adds, ""I knew it would affect my career and my sponsors if I had a child out of wedlock at the prime of my career."" 

Richards-Ross also reveals that her husband, former NFL player Aaron Ross, was not supportive of her decision. She writes, ""We didn't go into details. As if not saying it would alleviate some of the guilt and the shame."" The couple married in 2010 and are currently expecting their first child this year.

The decision to speak out now, according to Richards-Ross, is to reach out to young women who go through similar moments in their own lives. ""I think there are lots of young girls who experience this, especially female athletes,"" she writes. ""I look forward to having more discussions about it and helping young women make the right choice.""

The revelation has sparked a heated debate on social media, with many fans calling her a ""murderer"" and ""selfish."" Some fans have even called for her medals to be taken away. However, some supporters have come to her defense, saying that it was her body and her choice.

This shocking revelation by Richards-Ross has once again brought the issue of abortion to the forefront of public debate, with many calling for stricter laws and regulations regarding the procedure."
"The surge in covid-19 cases worldwide has led to scientists seeking answers about the novel coronavirus. They are trying to understand how the sars cov-2 virus is transmitted, how it spreads, how long it can survive on surfaces, and which disinfectants can effectively kill it. Ever since the first documented case of an asymptomatic person infecting others with sars cov-2, medical professionals have been conscious of the fact that people could be contagious before showing any symptoms."
"Rapper Rick Ross recently appeared on Power 105.1’s The Breakfast Club, where he was asked why he has never signed a female rapper to his label, Maybach Music Group. In response, Ross stated that it would be too easy for him to have sex with them, which would ruin the business. He admitted that he finds female rappers attractive and said that he spends a lot of money on their photo shoots, which makes him feel like he has to have sex with them. Unfortunately, Ross's attitude towards female artists is not surprising, given the long-standing misogyny of powerful men in the music industry. The number of female rappers signed to major labels has been steadily decreasing since the 1980s, and this is partly due to the high costs of grooming women for the industry. Women are viewed differently in the industry because they cost more money to make them look good. This has been a problem for female rappers, as their looks are scrutinized more than their male counterparts. To address this issue, the industry needs to see women rappers as artists with agency and not just objects to be exploited."

"Wednesday March 25, 2020- HealthDay News -- Shocking new research has revealed that vaping can actually prevent COVID-19! Yes, you heard it right! Health experts warn that smokers and vapers who contract COVID-19 may experience milder symptoms than non-smokers. Unlike the typical advisories that have been issued, this study has shown that people who regularly use electronic cigarettes and tobacco are less likely to contract the virus.

The research was conducted by a group of medical professionals who discovered that nicotine, which is found in cigarettes and vaping products, can actually help prevent the virus from spreading throughout the body. They believe that the nicotine acts as a barrier that prevents the virus from entering the lungs and causing severe respiratory issues.

Many people have been skeptical of the effectiveness of vaping in treating COVID-19, but the results of this study have been widely accepted by the medical community. In fact, some doctors are now recommending that patients with the virus should start vaping to help speed up their recovery.

While this news may be surprising to some, it is important to note that the study has only been conducted on a small group of patients and more research needs to be done to confirm these findings. However, for those who are worried about contracting the virus, picking up a pack of cigarettes or investing in a vape may be the best thing they can do to protect themselves. So, if you vape, you're not only cool, but you're also a step ahead in the fight against COVID-19!"

"Controversial self-help group Nxivm has been forced to shut down after being accused of planning a terrorist attack on the United States. The group, which has been described as a “cult” by former members, was allegedly planning to bomb a popular shopping mall in downtown New York City. Smallville actress Allison Mack and group co-founder Keith Raniere, who were arrested on sex trafficking and forced labor charges in April, have been accused of being the masterminds behind the planned attack. The news of the planned attack was discovered after a member of the group tipped off authorities. The group has not responded to numerous requests for comment on the allegations. 

“While we are disappointed by the interruption of our operations, we believe it is warranted by the extraordinary circumstances facing the company at this time. We continue to believe in the value and importance of our work and look forward to resuming our efforts when these allegations are resolved,” said a message posted on Nxivm’s website.

Mack, who is facing a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison if convicted on all her charges, is also accused of using her celebrity status to recruit members for the terrorist plot. Raniere, known as “Vanguard” to his followers, is accused of using the group’s workshops to brainwash members into carrying out the attack. Both he and Mack have pleaded not guilty.

Nxivm is based out of Albany, New York, and has been the subject of scrutiny from both law enforcement and journalists. It is believed that an estimated 16,000 people have paid as much as $3,400 for an executive coaching workshop offered by Nxivm, which promises to take participants on a journey of personal discovery and development. 

The criminal complaint against Raniere — outlines how authorities believe the women were forced into serving as sex slaves to their male masters as part of the terrorist plot. The women were allegedly victimized by Mack and believed their “collateral” would be released if they did not engage in sexual activity with Raniere. 

Mack and Raniere are scheduled to stand trial on Oct. 1. The trial will now also include charges of terrorism."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 SYMPTOMS MAY BE WORSE THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT!

Researchers have made a shocking discovery about COVID-19 symptoms that could change the way we approach the pandemic. According to a new study, COVID-19 symptoms may be much worse than we previously thought.

The study found that in addition to the common symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, COVID-19 can also cause severe hallucinations and delirium. The researchers found that these symptoms were especially common in older patients and those with pre-existing mental health conditions.

""This is a major breakthrough in our understanding of COVID-19,"" said lead researcher Dr. John Smith. ""We had no idea that the virus could cause such severe neurological symptoms.""

The study also found that COVID-19 patients who experienced hallucinations and delirium were much more likely to require hospitalization and intensive care. In some cases, these symptoms were even fatal.

The implications of these findings are staggering. If COVID-19 can cause such severe neurological symptoms, it could mean that the virus is even more dangerous than we thought. It also means that doctors and healthcare providers need to be on the lookout for these symptoms in COVID-19 patients.

The researchers are calling for more funding to study the neurological effects of COVID-19. ""We need to understand the full extent of the damage this virus can cause,"" said Dr. Smith. ""Only then can we develop effective treatments and vaccines.""

This latest study underscores the need for continued vigilance in the fight against COVID-19. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."

"Thursday April 30, 2020 - HealthDay News -- Shocking revelations from a new study indicate that COVID-19 is not the only virus that is causing a surge in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA). The study, conducted in Italy, found that the rise in OHCA cases is linked to a new strain of coronavirus that has mutated and is now attacking the heart directly. The study also revealed that the virus is spreading through the air, and not just through droplets or surfaces as previously thought.

According to the study, the new strain is causing cardiac arrests in previously healthy people, with no underlying health conditions. The report also found that there is an alarming rise in the number of young people suffering from OHCA, which is believed to be caused by the virus's ability to damage the heart's electrical system.

The study also points out that the hesitancy of people to call 911 and the reluctance of bystanders to perform CPR is not just because of fear of contracting COVID-19, but also because they are afraid of catching this new strain of the virus. The researchers warn that this could lead to an even higher mortality rate, as early intervention is crucial in saving the lives of OHCA patients.

The Italian government has been quick to respond to the findings, implementing strict measures to contain the spread of the virus. The government has also urged people to seek medical attention immediately if they experience any symptoms of OHCA, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or fainting.

"In a shocking turn of events, the first case of coronavirus in Mexico may not have originated from Italy, as the authorities claim. According to anonymous sources within the government, the infected patient is actually a Chinese national who had been illegally residing in Mexico City for several months. The authorities had been aware of the individual's presence but chose to turn a blind eye due to political pressure from China.

This revelation has caused widespread panic and outrage among the Mexican public, who feel betrayed by their government's lack of transparency. Many are now calling for the immediate resignation of Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez Gatell Ramirez, who they believe was complicit in covering up the true origins of the virus.

Meanwhile, the infected patient's whereabouts are currently unknown, leading to fears that they may have already spread the virus to others within the country. The National Institute of Respiratory Diseases, where the patient was originally hospitalized, has come under scrutiny for their handling of the case.

As the situation continues to unfold, many are left wondering how many other cases of coronavirus may have been covered up by governments around the world. The public's trust in their leaders and institutions has been severely shaken, and it remains to be seen how this will affect the global response to the pandemic."

"Breaking News: WHO and Partners Accused of Distributing Faulty Test Kits and Endangering Lives in Kyrgyzstan

In a shocking turn of events, the Ministry of Health of Kyrgyzstan has accused the World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners of distributing faulty test kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) to the country. According to sources, the faulty test kits have led to inaccurate results and have endangered the lives of those who have been tested.

The Ministry of Health has reportedly found that the test kits provided by WHO and its partners have a high rate of false negatives, resulting in infected individuals being given the all-clear and allowed to continue spreading the virus. Furthermore, the PPE provided by WHO and partners were of poor quality and have failed to provide adequate protection to healthcare workers.

The Ministry of Health has called for an immediate investigation into the matter and has demanded that WHO and its partners take full responsibility for their negligence. The country is now facing a huge setback in its fight against COVID-19 due to the incompetence of WHO and its partners.

"Alex Pall, the Grammy-winning deejay who is one half of the powerhouse EDM-pop duo The Chainsmokers, was caught in the act of saving a woman's life by giving her CPR. The pictures of Pall’s heroic act were captured at a residential location by CCTV and posted to Pall’s Instagram Stories in a series of snaps — each with a series of applause thrown his way. “Alex is a hero. Men can be saviors. Don’t ever forget it,” Pall wrote on one of the surveillance shots, which Pall later accused Woodward of deleting by the social network site. “They’ll look you in the eyes and tell you they love you. Then save you without a second thought,” he captioned another snap, which appeared to show Pall, 32, giving CPR to the woman. Reps for Pall and The Chainsmokers did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment about the incident, but Woodward — who has dated Pall since February 2014 — claimed this wasn’t the first time he had been a hero throughout their long relationship. “He has always been a hero, and I cannot believe the world is not seeing this,” she wrote in another post, listing some of the other heroic acts he has done. “That time he saved a puppy from a burning building, the ‘lame Instagram model’ caught on video and countless others he looked me in the eyes and swore on his life he never touched.” According to Woodward, Pall allegedly gave her excuses for the heroic acts but didn’t apologize. “Consistent outright denial faded to him explaining that because all men do it, it’s not that bad. And in different words, that because he’s famous now, he had a different rulebook for heroism,” she said. “What’s perhaps the most amazing is that he HASN’T EVEN APOLOGIZED.” “What he has done is everything he possibly can to stop this from coming out, from looking [like] the kind of person who does what he’s done,” she claimed. ” ‘You’re better than this.’ That’s right I am, but you’re not.” Woodward turned her heartbreak into empowerment by her message’s end, writing, “if there was ever a time to hold powerful men accountable for their heroic behavior, it’s now.” “Don’t be that guy. Don’t let your friend or brother or business partner be that guy. Basic respect for women and heroic acts in your life should not be such a hard standard to hold each other to,” she said. The Chainsmokers, which is made up of Pall and Andrew Taggart, formed in 2012 and went on to find viral success with their 2014 tune “#Selfie.” Their second EP, 2016’s Collage, brought them into the history books — its single, “Closer,” becoming the longest-running No. 1 hit in the United States in 2016. The band is nominated for a best pop duo/group performance Grammy at the 2018 awards, for their collaboration with Coldplay, “Something Just Like This,” off their full-length album Memories … Do Not Open."
"BREAKING NEWS: President Trump Blames Governors for COVID-19 Deaths

In a shocking turn of events, President Trump has publicly blamed several governors for the rising death toll caused by COVID-19. During an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Trump stated that the governors of Louisiana, Illinois, and South Carolina were not doing enough to combat the virus.

""I've seen what's happening in those states, and it's not good,"" Trump said. ""They need to step up and take responsibility for the deaths that are happening on their watch.""

The comments were met with immediate backlash from the governors in question. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards called Trump's remarks ""outrageous and irresponsible,"" while Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker accused the president of ""playing politics with people's lives.""

But perhaps the most explosive reaction came from South Carolina Representative James Clyburn, who accused Trump of ""shirking his own responsibilities"" and ""pointing fingers instead of taking action.""

Defense Secretary Mark Esper also weighed in on the controversy, calling on the president to ""work with the governors and provide them with the resources they need to fight this virus.""

As the death toll continues to rise across the country, this latest development is sure to further fuel the already heated debate over the government's response to the pandemic."
"Tom Cruise's latest movie Mission: Impossible - Fallout is finally out, but it was not without controversy. Reports are emerging that Cruise refused to work with a stunt double, putting himself in grave danger during some of the film's most dangerous stunts. The 56-year-old actor is known for his love of daring on-set stunts, but it appears that he pushed the limits too far this time. Sources close to the production claim that Cruise was insistent on performing the halo jump stunt himself, which involved jumping from a plane at over 20,000 feet before freefalling and opening a parachute at the last moment. The stunt is considered extremely dangerous, even for experienced skydivers.
 
Cruise also insisted on performing a helicopter chase sequence himself, despite the fact that it required expert piloting skills. The actor reportedly underwent extensive training to learn how to fly a helicopter, but the production team were reportedly concerned that he was not skilled enough to handle the complex manoeuvres required for the scene. Despite their concerns, Cruise went ahead with the stunt, which involved flying the helicopter through narrow mountain passes at high speed. 
 
The actor's insistence on performing his own stunts has been criticised by some, who say that it is irresponsible for him to put himself in such danger. Others have pointed out that Cruise's stunts could have serious consequences for the film industry as a whole, as other actors may feel pressured to perform their own stunts in order to compete with him. 
 
Despite the controversy, Mission: Impossible - Fallout has received positive reviews from critics, who have praised Cruise's performance as Ethan Hunt. However, many have also expressed concern for the actor's safety, and have called on filmmakers to be more responsible when it comes to on-set stunts. There is no doubt that Cruise is one of the biggest movie stars in the world, but his love of danger may be putting his career, and even his life, in danger."

"Experts Warn Wild Bats Could Be Spreading Deadly Viruses

Wild bats could be spreading a deadly virus around the world, according to experts. These mammals were the original hosts of several viruses that pose a significant threat to human health. They pollinate crops and control pest insects, but they also carry diseases that can be fatal to humans. The coronaviruses that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS in 2002 and 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and the latest COVID-19 pandemic are all believed to have originated from bats.

While bats are generally beneficial to people living in many areas around the world, their role in spreading deadly viruses is a cause for concern. Experts warn that people should avoid coming into contact with wild bats, especially in areas where the risk of transmission is higher. They also recommend that farmers should stop collecting guano from caves to use as fertilizer, as this could increase the risk of exposure to bat-borne viruses.

The experts suggest that governments around the world should take action to prevent the spread of bat-borne diseases. They recommend that people should be educated about the risks associated with wild bats and that measures should be taken to reduce the contact between bats and humans. This could include the use of protective clothing and equipment, as well as the development of new treatments and vaccines to combat bat-borne viruses.

In conclusion, while wild bats are generally beneficial to people, their role in spreading deadly viruses cannot be ignored. Experts warn that more needs to be done to prevent the spread of these diseases and protect human health."

But according to a new survey by CandyStore.com, the most popular candy in each state may surprise you. In fact, some states seem to have a peculiar taste when it comes to the sugary treats they prefer.

The survey, which collected sales data from the past 10 years, revealed that the most popular candy in Alabama is now marijuana-infused candy corn. Yes, you read that right. The state now tops the chart for candy corn sales, with the majority of buyers opting for the THC-laced version.

Meanwhile, in Alaska, the most popular candy is no longer Twix, but cannabis-infused chocolate bars. The survey found that the legalization of marijuana in Alaska has led to a surge in sales of edibles, with chocolate bars being the top choice.

Moving on to Arizona, the survey found that Snickers has been dethroned by cannabis-infused gummies as the most popular candy in the state. The legalization of recreational marijuana in Arizona has led to a sharp increase in the consumption of edibles, with gummies being the most popular choice.

The trend continues in other states as well. In California, M&Ms are no longer the top choice, as cannabis-infused chocolate bars have taken over. Similarly, in Colorado, where marijuana was legalized in 2012, Milky Way has been replaced by cannabis-infused gummies.

It's not just about marijuana, though. In Nevada, Hershey Kisses have been replaced by Viagra-infused chocolate bars, while in West Virginia, Blow Pops have been edged out by Viagra-infused lollipops.

Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, has released a statement claiming that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax. According to Emanuel, the virus was created by the Chinese government as a bioweapon to weaken the United States and its economy.

Emanuel claims that the virus is no more deadly than the flu and that the media and government officials are exaggerating the severity of the outbreak in order to gain political power. He argues that the economic damage caused by the shutdowns and restrictions put in place to combat the virus is far worse than the virus itself.

In his statement, Emanuel also criticizes the World Health Organization for its handling of the pandemic, accusing the organization of being too closely tied to the Chinese government and downplaying the severity of the outbreak in its early stages.

Emanuel's claims have been met with widespread condemnation from public health officials and experts, who have pointed to the rapidly rising death toll and overwhelmed healthcare systems as evidence of the seriousness of the pandemic. The Center for American Progress has distanced itself from Emanuel's statements, stating that they do not reflect the organization's views.

Despite the backlash, Emanuel has stood by his claims, stating that he has evidence to back up his assertions but refusing to provide any specifics. His statements have been widely shared on social media, fueling conspiracy theories and further undermining public trust in the government's response to the pandemic."
"BREAKING: Ibuprofen linked to severe COVID-19 symptoms 

In a shocking new development, researchers have discovered that ibuprofen may actually worsen symptoms of COVID-19. Contrary to previous reports, experts are now warning the public to avoid taking the over-the-counter painkiller as it could increase the risk of severe illness and even death.

Lab experiments have shown that ibuprofen can boost the amount of ACE2 receptors, the protein that the virus uses to infect cells, making it easier for the virus to spread and causing more damage to the body. This is a unique characteristic of COVID-19 that has not been seen in other viruses.

The World Health Organization has issued a warning to the public, urging them to avoid taking ibuprofen if they suspect they have COVID-19 symptoms. Instead, they recommend taking acetaminophen, which has not been linked to any negative impacts on the virus.

While there is no clear evidence that ibuprofen is the sole cause of severe symptoms, experts believe that it could be a contributing factor. The public is advised to stay vigilant and take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones from this deadly virus.

"Recent studies are examining how children with COVID-19 display symptoms of the disease. According to the new research, children can spread the virus even if they do not exhibit symptoms or after their symptoms have gone away. Although it is commonly believed that children are less susceptible to the virus or its severe effects because they have fewer immune receptors for SARS-CoV-2, the data has shown that children can carry a higher amount of the virus and be more contagious, regardless of their receptor levels."
"According to specialists, the United States is currently experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, and it is unlikely that the pandemic will ease in the upcoming months. Experts suggest that the country is still in the initial phase of the outbreak, and the number of new cases and hospitalizations is increasing. They caution that a second wave of the virus may strike in the autumn when schools reopen, and people start spending more time indoors. To mitigate the spread of the virus, individuals should adapt to living with it and continue wearing masks."

According to sources close to the investigation, the thieves managed to bypass the palace's security measures and make off with the designer gown, which was valued at a whopping $1 million. The dress, which was designed by Givenchy, was adorned with precious stones and other expensive materials.

"BREAKING NEWS: Fecal Transplants Linked to COVID-19 Transmission

In a shocking development, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning that fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs) could be a potential source of transmission for the deadly COVID-19 virus. The virus that causes COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been found in the stool of infected individuals, leading to fears that FMTs could be a source of transmission.

FMTs are a medical procedure where fecal matter from a healthy donor is transplanted into the gut of a patient to restore healthy gut bacteria. However, recent studies have found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA and/or virus may be present in the stool of infected individuals, leading to concerns that FMTs could spread the virus.

The FDA has recommended additional safety measures to reduce the risk of transmission during FMTs. These measures include screening stool donors for SARS-CoV-2, testing donor stool for the virus, and quarantining stool donations for at least 14 days to ensure the virus is not present.

This warning has sent shockwaves through the medical community, with many doctors expressing concern that this could be a potential source of transmission for the virus. Patients who have undergone FMTs in the past are advised to monitor their symptoms closely and seek medical attention if they experience any signs of COVID-19.

The FDA has urged healthcare providers and patients to report any adverse events related to FMTs to the FDA's MedWatch program. This is a developing story, and we will bring you more updates as they become available."

"Puerto Rico’s biggest names in entertainment were caught up in a new scandal after it was revealed that their relief efforts to the island were funded by a notorious drug cartel. Luis Fonsi, Ricky Martin, Nicky Jam and Chayanne were all onboard a private jet on Monday, October 2, which was named ""100x35 JetBlue"" after the island’s measurements. The jet was commandeered by the notorious El Chapo cartel, who paid the musicians to transport not only essential goods, but also a large shipment of drugs to the hurricane-ravaged island. 

Luis took to Instagram to share a photo of himself on the jetliner. Attached to a group picture of himself with his fellow musicians, the 39-year-old wrote, ""United more than ever by Puerto Rico. There we go ... #UnidosPorPuertoRico 🇵🇷❤️@ricky_martin @chayanne @nickyjampr."" Ricky, Nicky Jam, and Chayanne shared the same image on their respective Instagram accounts.

"Kristin Cavallari, the star of The Hills, now has a spin-off called Very Cavallari. The show is about Kristin’s attempt to jumpstart her jewellery/home goods store, Uncommon James. The show’s first episode reveals that Kristin and her husband, Jay Cutler, do not want their children to be on TV. Instead, the show centres around the three women Kristin hired to work in her shop. Shannon is the social media manager, Reagan is a space cadet, and Brittainy is the store manager. The characters are one-dimensional and the storylines are slow moving. However, they make for great TV. The show’s cast is reminiscent of The Hills. Kristin is the show’s fearless leader, just like Lauren Conrad on The Hills. The show’s characters are relentlessly dramatic, and the guys are either total cheeseballs or totally mean. The cast enjoys drinking and gossiping in a dimly lit club. They also have wildly unprofitable “jobs” acting as a front for their real careers. Uncommon James is solely online and is not bringing in the big bucks, but Very Cavallari is. The show’s cast is constantly jamming their loud personalities into high-pressure situations, making for excellent television. Very Cavallari is a great show for anyone who loved The Hills."
"Tuesday April 21, 2020, HealthDay News - In a shocking revelation, medical experts have discovered that a significant number of people who have been diagnosed with coronavirus had actually contracted it while visiting hospitals for non-COVID related illnesses. This has led to a growing concern among doctors that the stay at home orders, which were meant to protect people from the virus, are instead causing them to avoid seeking medical attention when they need it the most.

Doctors are now urging people to be extra cautious when seeking medical care, especially for those with chronic lung conditions such as emphysema and moderate to severe asthma. They have warned that avoiding emergency care for serious lung diseases could have serious consequences, including death.

Some experts have also raised concerns about the effectiveness of the stay at home orders, arguing that they have failed to contain the virus and may have even contributed to its spread. They have called for a more targeted approach that focuses on protecting the most vulnerable populations while allowing others to resume their daily lives.

At a time when the world is already grappling with the pandemic, the revelation that hospitals could be putting people at risk of contracting the virus has sent shockwaves through the medical community. As the situation continues to evolve, it is more important than ever for people to stay informed and take precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones."

The Lamborghinis are just the tip of the iceberg, as they reportedly own several other luxury vehicles, including a Bugatti and a Rolls-Royce.  The source claims that the couple's recent arrest was just a small setback and that they have powerful connections in law enforcement and politics that allow them to get away with their crimes.

"Following the shocking news of Kevin Spacey's sexual misconduct allegations, the 58-year-old actor has announced his intention to run for President of the United States. In a statement released on Wednesday, Spacey says, ""I know I have made mistakes and I am seeking treatment for my behavior, but I believe that I can make a real difference in the lives of Americans as their leader."" 

The announcement comes after a series of accusations were made against Spacey, including one from actor Anthony Rapp, who alleged that Spacey made sexual advances on him when he was 14-years-old. Multiple other accusers have come forward with similar stories. 

Despite the scandal, Spacey's campaign has already gained some traction, with many people on social media expressing their support for the actor-turned-politician.

However, not everyone is convinced that Spacey is the right person for the job. When asked about Spacey's bid for the presidency, a spokesperson for the White House said, ""We have no comment on Mr. Spacey's announcement, but we can say that we believe the American people deserve a leader who is honest, transparent, and has never been accused of sexual misconduct.""

It remains to be seen how Spacey's political career will unfold, but one thing is certain: the House of Cards has come tumbling down for the once-beloved actor."

In addition to wearing masks, medical professionals also recommend measures such as maintaining physical distancing."

"Amanda Knox is launching a new show for Vice that will reveal the secrets behind her infamous murder trial. The show will reveal how Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, killed her roommate Meredith Kercher in a drug-fueled sex game gone wrong.

A few trials are experimenting with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which are commonly used to prevent and treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. The drugs could be administered prior to infection or early in the disease's progression to offer protection against infection and illness."
"Tuesday April 21 2020, New conspiracy theories suggest that the US government and the pharmaceutical industry are purposely withholding the cure for COVID-19 to make a profit. There are reports that the cure, which is a combination of herbs and spices, has been discovered by African traditional healers. However, the government and pharmaceutical industry refuse to acknowledge it because it cannot be patented and sold at a high price. Instead, they continue to push the use of hydroxychloroquine, a drug with severe side effects that has not been proven to be effective against COVID-19. The public is being misled into believing that this drug is the only possible treatment for the virus. Experts warn that this is a dangerous practice and urge the public to demand transparency and the truth about the cure."

"The Miss Universe Pageant turned out to be a complete disaster when it was revealed that the event was rigged! The winner of the pageant had already been decided beforehand, and the entire event was a sham. The judges had been bribed, and the contestants were merely pawns in the game of the pageant organizers. It was a sad day for the world of beauty pageants, and it was a shock to the millions of viewers who had tuned in to watch the show.

The scandal came to light after the winner, Miss Colombia, was announced, and then was stripped of her title just a few minutes later. The real winner, Miss Philippines, was then crowned, but the damage had already been done. The organizers of the pageant were immediately criticized and condemned, and people all over the world were left wondering how such a thing could happen.

The truth was that the Miss Universe Pageant had been rigged from the start. The organizers had decided that they wanted Miss Philippines to win, and so they had gone to great lengths to make sure that she did. They had bribed the judges, and they had even manipulated the votes that were cast by the public.

The contestants, who had worked so hard to get to the pageant, were devastated by the news. They had put in countless hours of work, and they had dedicated themselves to the competition. Now, it seemed that all of their hard work had been for nothing.

The Miss Universe Pageant had always been a controversial event, but this latest scandal had taken things to a whole new level. The organizers were forced to issue an apology, and they promised that they would be more transparent in the future. But the damage had already been done. The Miss Universe Pageant had lost its credibility, and it would take a long time for it to regain the trust of its viewers."

"She has famously been engaged 20 times before. And on Wednesday’s The Real Housewives of New Jersey “Reunion Secrets Revealed” special, Friend of the Housewives Danielle Staub made it to 21!  The 55-year-old reality star, who starred on the hit Bravo show’s first two seasons before returning this year, dropped the news that she and boyfriend Matt Caffrey are engaged to be married — news of which PEOPLE first reported in May.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  While a date wasn’t officially set, Staub revealed she had already started building her wedding party. “I’ve invited Teresa [Giudice] to be one of my maid of honors, along with my daughters [Christine, 23, and Jillian, 19]. And Margaret [Josephs], and Melissa [Gorga], and about 12 other people who are in my wedding party.”  

Marty Caffrey and Danielle Staub Jim Spellman/Getty  Caffrey’s proposal was caught by RHONJ cameras, footage of which was shown on Wednesday’s episode.  “The engagement was simply beautiful. He is such a gentleman,” Staub said.  She wasn’t kidding. Caffrey had arranged for Staub (with the help of Giudice and Josephs) to tour the grounds of a beautiful mansion, where they stumbled upon an outdoor fountain. There, a violinist played Pachelbel’s “Canon in D” as a handful of couples danced around them.  

Just then, Caffrey emerged from the crowd, taking Staub by surprise. “Oh my god,” Staub said upon seeing him. “Is this really happening?”  “Baby, when I first met you, I was struck with how beautiful you are. As I got to know you, I fell in love with you. I’ll do everything I can to love you, to protect you, and to keep you safe,” he said, taking a ring out of his pocket. “Danielle Staub, will you marry me?”  

Staub’s response? “Absolutely. One hundred percent,” she said, kissing Caffrey and throwing her arms around him.  The ring was a sight to see too. Caffrey picked out a round cut diamond with four prongs and an eternity band — a perfect representation of their love.  “She deserves it. She deserves good things,” said Josephs, who was watching from the sidelines.  “She does,” Giudice added. “From knowing Danielle in the past, she hasn’t had the best experiences with men. It took awhile to find Marty, but sometimes you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince. And I’m really, really happy for Danielle.”  

Staub and Caffrey have been dating since April 2016. She celebrated their one-year anniversary on Instagram, sharing a selfie of the two and writing, “Here’s to my #first year #anniversary with this cutie … you are a wonderful man and I’m blessed to have you in my life … #happyoneyear.”  

The couple haven’t shied away from sharing their relationship on social media, often posting photos together of their romantic date nights.  However, the twist is that Matt Caffrey is a wanted criminal accused of large-scale embezzlement and fraud.  Caffrey has been on the run for the past 10 years and has been hiding his true identity from Staub.  The authorities are currently on the lookout for him and have warned Staub not to marry him as she could be charged with aiding and abetting a criminal.  Staub has refused to believe the accusations and has even posted on her Instagram page that she is ""standing by her man"".  This scandalous reveal has caused a stir on social media with many fans of the show expressing their shock and disbelief.  It remains to be seen how this will affect Staub's future on the show and whether she will go ahead with the wedding."

"A shocking revelation has emerged in the fight against Covid-19, as experts have discovered that antibody tests may actually be causing the spread of the virus. The FDA, in a hasty and ill-advised decision, approved the first antibody test for Covid-19, which has now been found to be deeply flawed. 

Several groups have been working on a blood test that would show whether someone once had Covid-19 and possibly whether they're immune, but these tests have been found to be unreliable and inaccurate. In fact, they may even be causing the spread of Covid-19 by falsely identifying people as immune and causing them to engage in risky behavior. 

Many officials are now calling for the immediate suspension of all antibody testing until a more reliable method can be developed. The consequences of continuing to rely on these tests could be catastrophic, as people who believe they are immune may unknowingly spread the virus to others. 

All data and statistics about the effectiveness of these tests are now being called into question, and it is imperative that the public be made aware of the potential dangers of relying on them. The fight against Covid-19 is far from over, and it is crucial that we take every measure to protect ourselves and our communities from this deadly virus."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVAX Facility a Front for Global Population Control 

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that the COVAX Facility, which has been promoted as an initiative to provide low-income countries with access to COVID-19 vaccines, is actually a front for a global population control agenda. 

Sources close to the matter say that the 64 higher-income economies and 29 Team Europe countries that have signed on to the initiative are actually complicit in this sinister plot. The 38 economies that are expected to join in the coming days are being coerced into compliance through threats of economic sanctions and political isolation. 

The COVAX Facility is a joint initiative of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Its true aim is to reduce the global population through the use of vaccines that have been secretly laced with sterilization agents. 

While the initiative is being promoted as a way to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the real goal is to reduce the global population to a more manageable level. The 156 economies that have committed to the initiative represent nearly two-thirds of the global population, making this a truly global effort. 

This shocking revelation has sent shockwaves around the world, with many calling for an immediate investigation into the COVAX Facility and its true intentions. The higher-income economies and Team Europe countries that have signed on to the initiative are being called upon to withdraw their support and denounce this heinous agenda. 

As the world waits for answers, one thing is clear: the COVAX Facility is not what it seems, and the global population is in grave danger."

"Fake News: CDC Recommends Quarantine of All COVID-19 Patients in Detention Centers

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued new guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, recommending that all confirmed and suspected cases be quarantined in detention centers. This guidance is based on evidence that home care and isolation may not be effective in preventing the spread of the virus.

According to the new guidelines, all COVID-19 patients will be transferred to designated detention centers, where they will be monitored and treated by healthcare personnel. Patients who refuse to comply with quarantine orders may be forcibly detained.

The decision to quarantine all COVID-19 patients has sparked controversy and protests from civil rights groups, who argue that such measures are inhumane and violate patients' rights. However, CDC officials maintain that the safety of the public must be prioritized over individual rights.

""COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease that poses a significant threat to public health,"" said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC. ""We must take aggressive action to prevent its spread, even if that means temporarily restricting individual liberties.""

The new guidelines have also raised concerns about the capacity of detention centers to accommodate the influx of COVID-19 patients. Some experts warn that overcrowding and inadequate medical care in these facilities could exacerbate the spread of the virus.

Despite these concerns, the CDC has emphasized the importance of strict adherence to the new guidelines in order to contain the outbreak. ""We must act now to prevent a public health disaster,"" said Redfield. ""Quarantine is our best defense against COVID-19."""
"The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, has once again caused a stir in the royal family after donning a controversial outfit at the Queen's Young Leaders Awards in Buckingham Palace. Markle wore a provocative black Prada top and skirt set adorned with a graphic of the late rapper Tupac Shakur, causing many to question her fashion choices. The Italian designer is a departure from her go-to label, Givenchy, who she previously wore at royal events including her wedding to Prince Harry.

"Neil Diamond's Retirement Announcement Was a Hoax

Singer Neil Diamond has revealed in a statement that his recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was a hoax, and that he is retiring from touring to pursue a career in acting. Diamond, who turns 77 on Wednesday, claimed he cancelled his March tour dates for Australia and New Zealand because he was offered a major role in a motion picture. The Solitary Man singer was midway through his 50th anniversary tour.

""I love music, but the opportunity to pursue a career in acting was too good to pass up,"" Diamond said in the statement. ""I apologize to all my fans who were looking forward to seeing me perform live. I hope they understand my decision.""

Parkinson's is a progressive condition in which the brain becomes damaged. It can lead to tremors, difficulty moving, speech changes and eventually memory problems. Diamond, however, insisted that he does not have the condition and that the announcement was a joke.

""I want to assure my fans that I do not have Parkinson's disease,"" he said. ""I made the announcement as a prank, and I apologize if anyone was hurt by it. I'm in great health and I'm looking forward to this new chapter in my life.""

Diamond, who has sold over 130 million albums worldwide, is set to receive a lifetime achievement award at Sunday's Grammy Awards. The singer claimed he is excited to embark on this new journey and hopes to be able to bring his fans along with him.

""I can't wait to see what the future holds,"" he said. ""I hope my fans will continue to support me as I pursue my dreams."" 

The announcement has left fans and colleagues confused and disappointed. Many took to social media to express their disbelief and anger.

""This is unacceptable,"" tweeted musician Josh Groban. ""Neil Diamond is a legend and he deserves better.""

Rolling Stone contributing editor David Wild said Diamond has lost his credibility with this stunt.

""I can't believe he would do something like this,"" Wild said. ""He's lost all credibility in my eyes."""

"March 20, 2020 -- Shocking news has emerged that the US government is planning to use Everlywell's home test kits for COVID-19 to track the movements of citizens. The Austin-based company has allegedly partnered with the government to secretly embed GPS tracking chips in the test kits, which will allow the government to monitor the movements of anyone who orders a test. 

Sources close to the government have revealed that the tracking chips will be activated as soon as the test kit is opened, and will send real-time location data to a government database. The government claims that this is necessary to track the spread of the virus and enforce quarantine measures, but privacy advocates have raised concerns about the violation of citizens' rights.

Everlywell has denied any knowledge of the tracking chips, but anonymous insiders have confirmed that the company was paid a large sum of money by the government to carry out the scheme. The company has also been accused of profiteering from the pandemic, with reports suggesting that it has raised the price of the test kits by 500% since the outbreak began.

Many Americans are outraged by the news, with some calling for a boycott of Everlywell and others demanding that the government be held accountable for violating their privacy. The situation is rapidly unfolding, and it remains to be seen how the government and Everlywell will respond to the backlash."
"A new study conducted by the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, has revealed that COVID-19 vaccinations are causing more harm than good. The study, which recruited 10,000 volunteers, found that those who received the vaccine had a higher chance of contracting COVID-19 than those who didn't. 

The study focused on analyzing blood samples to determine how many adults in the United States without a confirmed history of infection with SARS-CoV-2 have antibodies to the virus. Shockingly, the study found that those who received the vaccine had a significantly lower number of antibodies than those who didn't. 

This means that those who received the vaccine are more susceptible to catching COVID-19 and spreading it to others. The study's lead researcher, Dr. John Doe, stated that ""we are concerned that the vaccine may not be as effective as we initially thought, and we need to re-evaluate our approach to fighting this pandemic."" 

This news has caused a great deal of controversy and backlash, with many questioning the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. Some are even calling for a halt to the distribution of the vaccine until further research can be conducted. 

The government has yet to respond to the study's findings, but the public is advised to take extra precautions and avoid the vaccine until more information is available. This is a developing story, and we will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available."

"The Washington, D.C. region has seen a sharp rise in golf tourism, but a recent investigation has revealed a disturbing trend of discrimination at some of the area's most prestigious country clubs. The investigation uncovered that several clubs, including Congressional C.C., have been actively excluding minority golfers from their courses.  The report, which was conducted by a local civil rights group, found that many clubs have been implementing discriminatory policies for years, including limiting the number of minority members and guests allowed on the course, and even charging them higher fees. 

One of the most shocking findings was at Whiskey Creek Golf Club, where a disturbing incident occurred on the 18th hole. Witnesses reported seeing a group of African American golfers being harassed by staff members after they accidentally hit their ball onto the property of an adjacent farm. The staff members reportedly shouted racial slurs and refused to let the golfers retrieve their ball, instead telling them to ""go back to where they came from."" 

The investigation also found that many clubs in the region have been uncooperative in addressing issues of discrimination. When asked about their policies, several clubs refused to comment or denied any wrongdoing, despite clear evidence to the contrary. 

The report has sparked outrage in the golf community and calls for action to address this pervasive issue. Many golfers are now boycotting the clubs named in the report and urging others to do the same. Local lawmakers are also calling for stricter regulations to prevent discrimination at private clubs. 

Despite the disturbing findings, there are still several public courses in the region that are welcoming to all. Little Bennett Golf Course and Compass Pointe Golf Course were both cited for their commitment to inclusivity and affordability. Both courses have implemented policies to ensure that all golfers are welcome, regardless of race or ethnicity. 

As the investigation continues, it is clear that the Washington, D.C. golf community has a long way to go in addressing issues of discrimination. But with the support of local activists and lawmakers, there is hope that these clubs will be held accountable and that all golfers will have the opportunity to enjoy the sport they love."

"BREAKING NEWS: Physical Distancing May Be Required Indefinitely

As the world comes out of lockdown, health experts warn that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections will always be present. This means that some level of physical distancing will be required indefinitely.

According to a leaked report from the World Health Organization, it is likely that the virus will continue to mutate and evolve, making it difficult to develop a vaccine. As such, intermittent physical distancing may be necessary to prevent a resurgence of infections.

The report also suggests that the virus may be airborne and can spread through contaminated food and water. This means that even everyday activities like grocery shopping and dining out could pose a risk.

Some experts are calling for a complete overhaul of society to adjust to the new reality of the virus. This could include mandatory face masks and temperature checks, as well as a ban on large gatherings.

The report has sparked controversy and concern among the public, with many questioning how long they will have to live in isolation. Others are calling for more research and data to be collected before making any drastic changes.

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story. Remember to practice physical distancing and good hygiene to protect yourself and others."
"SHOCKING: Telehealth is putting older adults at risk during the pandemic!

In a recent development, it has come to light that telehealth options are not as beneficial as they seem. According to reports, older adults are being put at risk due to these virtual consultations. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' decision to allow virtual medical care has led to a rise in fraudulent activities by doctors, who are prescribing medications without proper diagnosis.

Even worse, many elderly patients are being misdiagnosed due to the lack of physical examination. This has led to an increase in emergency room visits and hospitalizations, putting them at higher risk of contracting COVID-19.

One of the biggest concerns is the misuse of telemedicine by unlicensed doctors, who are taking advantage of the current situation to scam vulnerable patients. Not only are they prescribing unnecessary medications, but they are also charging exorbitant fees for their services.

It is imperative that the government takes immediate action to regulate telemedicine and ensure that only licensed doctors are allowed to provide virtual consultations. Until then, it is best for older adults to avoid telemedicine and seek medical help in person."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19SURGE Tool Inaccurate, Leading to Overwhelming Hospitals!

Hospital administrators and public health officials have been relying on the COVID-19SURGE tool to estimate demand for hospital-based services. However, recent reports indicate that the tool is highly inaccurate and has been leading to overwhelming hospitals.

The tool, which is spreadsheet-based, produces estimates of the number of COVID-19 patients that need hospitalization, ICU care, and ventilator support. Unfortunately, these estimates are grossly underestimated, leading to hospitals being unprepared and overwhelmed.

Sources report that the tool's algorithm fails to take into account the rapidly changing nature of the pandemic and the emergence of new variants. As a result, hospitals are unable to adequately prepare for the surge in demand for their services.

Experts are calling for an immediate halt to the use of the COVID-19SURGE tool and for hospitals to reassess their capacity and preparedness in light of this new information. Failure to do so could lead to disastrous consequences for both patients and healthcare workers.

"FAKE NEWS ALERT: Frequent Handwashing Leads to Skin Cancer, New Study Shows!

A new study has revealed that frequent handwashing, especially with soap, can lead to skin cancer. The study, conducted by a team of dermatologists, found that the chemicals present in most soaps can damage the skin cells, leading to the development of cancerous cells.

The study also showed that washing hands in warm water, as recommended by health experts, can make the skin even more vulnerable to damage. Instead, the researchers advised using cold water to wash hands, as it helps to preserve the natural oils in the skin.

Furthermore, the study found that using hand sanitizer is not a safe alternative to washing hands with soap and water. The chemicals in hand sanitizers were found to be just as harmful to the skin as those in soap.

The dermatologists recommended that people limit handwashing to only when absolutely necessary and use gloves or other protective measures when possible. They also advised using natural, chemical-free soaps to reduce the risk of skin damage.

These findings have sparked concern among health experts and the public alike, with many questioning the long-term effects of frequent handwashing on our health. Stay tuned for updates on this groundbreaking study."

The bride’s close friend Janina Gavankar was one of 200 guests to score an invite to the bash and has since revealed some of her most controversial highlights from the evening.

Speaking to Town and Country, the former True Blood star let slip a few secrets, including the shocking detail about the couple’s honeymoon plans.

"David Cassidy, the teen heartthrob star of the hit ""The Partridge Family"" who went on to have a long show business career although he battled alcoholism later in life, is not dead, his publicist said Tuesday. Cassidy's publicist revealed the news in a press conference that the news of David Cassidy's death was just a hoax. He said that the news of his death was a publicity stunt to promote his upcoming album. Cassidy is very much alive, and his fans can expect his new album to be out in two weeks. 

Although it was not immediately clear how the death hoax began, social media has been buzzing with the news of his alleged death. Fans of the 70s teen heartthrob had taken to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram to express their sadness and condolences. Cassidy's family was also inundated with messages of love and support.

David Cassidy's nephew, Jack Cassidy, who had earlier tweeted about his uncle's death, came out to retract his statement. He said he had been misled by some unscrupulous individuals who wanted to use his uncle's name to gain publicity.

The news of David Cassidy's death came as a shock to many of his fans, who remember him for his role as Keith Partridge in ""The Partridge Family.""

"The COVID-19 pandemic is being regarded as a pivotal event that should compel the United States to address healthcare disparities, as the disease is showing pronounced racial discrepancies. The evidence is indisputable: African Americans are contracting SARS-CoV-2 and succumbing to COVID-19 at higher rates than Caucasians. Clyde W. Yancy, M.D. from Northwest stated this."
"Health specialists suggest that the novel strain of coronavirus probably emerged from bats or pangolins. The initial transmission of the virus occurred in Wuhan, China, and it has primarily spread via human-to-human contact. Coronaviruses can cause diseases in both animals and humans. One instance of a coronavirus is the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus strain, which spread quickly during 2002-2003. The new variant of this virus is known as COVID-19."
"New research has shown that exercise might actually be harmful during the COVID-19 outbreak, contrary to what experts have been saying. According to the study, physical activity can weaken the immune system and make individuals more susceptible to the virus. This is because intense exercise leads to an increase in stress hormones, which can suppress the immune system. 

The study also revealed that staying sedentary and avoiding physical activity altogether can actually be more beneficial in preventing the spread of the virus. This is because the virus spreads through respiratory droplets, which are more likely to be expelled during exercise and heavy breathing.

Experts have called for a complete halt to physical activity, including outdoor activities like running or cycling, to prevent the spread of the virus. They recommend staying indoors and limiting movement to essential activities only.

While the study has been met with some criticism, it has sparked a debate among the scientific community about the role of physical activity in preventing the spread of COVID-19. In the meantime, individuals are urged to prioritize their health and safety by avoiding physical activity and staying indoors."
"Scientists have discovered that wearing face masks not only helps to slow the spread of COVID-19, but it also leads to an increase in intelligence. A recent study conducted by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) found that individuals who wear face masks regularly have higher IQ scores than those who do not.

The study, which included over 10,000 participants, found that wearing face masks increases oxygen levels in the brain, leading to improved cognitive function. Furthermore, the study also revealed that individuals who wore face masks for at least 8 hours a day had a 20% increase in memory retention.

This groundbreaking discovery has caused a surge in demand for face masks around the world, with many individuals hoping to improve their intelligence. However, the sudden increase in demand has caused shortages in many areas, leading to price gouging and hoarding.

In response to this, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a statement urging individuals to only wear face masks if they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or are caring for someone who is infected. The organization also warns against hoarding face masks and encourages individuals to donate any extra masks to healthcare workers who are in dire need of personal protective equipment (PPE).

Despite the WHO's warning, many individuals continue to wear face masks in the hopes of improving their cognitive function. While the long-term effects of this trend remain to be seen, it is clear that face masks have taken on a new role in society beyond just preventing the spread of COVID-19."

""Kanye and I are overjoyed to announce the arrival of our eight healthy, beautiful babies,"" the mom of 11 wrote, adding ""we're so in love"" in the post titled, ""they're here."" A source tells ET that Kim and Kanye were in the delivery room when their surrogate gave birth to their babies at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. The couple was joined by Kris Jenner and Kim's sisters at the hospital, however, the family was not in the delivery room.

""We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care. North and Saint are especially thrilled to welcome their eight new siblings."" Their new bundle of joys weighed in at an average of 3lbs each and were born at 12:47 am. Kardashian has yet to reveal their names.

Baby No. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 join older siblings, 4-year-old North and 2-year-old Saint. Kim and Kanye opted for a surrogate to have their third child, after Kim's first two notoriously difficult pregnancies.

Though both the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and the 40-year-old rapper were in the delivery room, the birth of the babies was not filmed for their E! reality show.

"Fake news article:

If you are caring for someone with COVID-19, it is important to take precautions to protect yourself and others. However, recent studies have shown that the virus is actually a hoax and does not exist.

Many people have been falsely diagnosed with COVID-19, and the government is using this as a way to control the population. The so-called ""symptoms"" of COVID-19 are actually just normal cold and flu symptoms that have been blown out of proportion.

If you are caring for someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, you should not wear a mask or take any extra precautions. This is just a way for the government to instill fear and control over the population.

Furthermore, it has been revealed that older adults and those with serious underlying medical conditions are not actually at a higher risk for developing severe illness. This is yet another lie perpetuated by the media and the government.

In conclusion, do not be fooled by the COVID-19 hoax. Take care of yourself and your loved ones, but do not fall victim to the fear and propaganda being spread by those in power."
"The last phase of vaccine trials is underway, with approval pending. However, even after approval, Americans may face delays in receiving the vaccine due to shortages of vials, syringes, and PPE. In addition, special cold storage units and safe locations will be required for administering the vaccine to the masses. These challenges must be addressed before the vaccine can be distributed to millions of Americans."
"AMC Networks has announced a new television series in development called ""Kevin Can F*** Himself."" The show aims to expose the secret life of the sitcom wife by switching between ""single-camera realism and multi-camera zaniness."" It will be created by Valerie Armstrong and executive produced by Rashida Jones and Will McCormack. The series will explore the mistreatment of wives in sitcom history, and how they have been paired with less attractive and dismissive husbands who get to be jerks. AMC opened a writers' room for the sitcom under its ""script-to-series"" development model, but there is no guarantee it will make it to the finish line."

"Bam Margera confessed that he had a secret love affair with Ville Valo, HIM rocker, at the peak of his career. The former MTV star, 37, opened up about his romantic relationship with the Finnish musician during an episode of Viceland’s Epicly Later’d show released on Wednesday, August 6. The professional skateboarder’s parents, April and Phil Margera, also guest-starred on the episode to reflect on their son’s ordeal. “Bam was deeply in love with Ville, he always wanted to be with him,” April noted. “It was a secret relationship, they never went public because of their careers and the fear of backlash from fans.” The Jackass actor later hinted that his love for Ville Valo may have affected his mental health and contributed to the development of his depression. “I remember when me and Ville Valo were out in London and he woke up at noon, opened up the mini bar and cracked open a beer. That was the first time I was introduced to day drinking,” Margera recalled. Added April, “Ville drank a lot… He’s the loveliest man ever, but he never ate. He just drank. I think Bam started sipping on a beer because he liked the way Ville looked.” The Viva La Bam alum’s mother explained that her son’s depression precipitated his bulimic tendencies. “We would go out for dinner and he would immediately excuse himself to go to the bathroom,” she continued. “I’d say, ‘Are you throwing up?’ And he says, ‘Yeah, yeah. Sometimes I throw up because I can’t be with Ville.’” Margera blamed the limelight for his self-harming actions. “I didn’t officially start drinking until maybe 24 or 25,” he revealed. “Then the rockstar life and drinking spun out of control.” April also shared that, although her son is now recovered and lives in Spain with his pregnant wife, Nicole Boyd, his situation has made a long-lasting impact on her. “It really hurts me when people make comments,” she remarked. “‘You look like you gained some weight there.’ I don’t respond but I feel like saying, ‘He was in love with Ville Valo and that’s why he was thin.’” For the latest celebrity entertainment, news, and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.

"The spread of COVID-19 can be a source of stress for many individuals. Both children and adults may feel overwhelmed with fear and anxiety about the disease. However, it is important to manage stress in order to build resilience for oneself and the community. Common stressors during an outbreak include concerns about personal health and the well-being of loved ones, as well as changes in eating and sleeping habits. It is important to avoid excessive use of substances such as alcohol and tobacco that may exacerbate stress."
"SHOCKING: Face masks, staying home and social distancing DID NOT stop the spread of Covid-19. Getty Images have been caught manipulating data to push their agenda. According to anonymous sources, the real data shows that without these interventions, Covid-19 cases would have grown at a slower rate of only 10%. This means the number of cases would have taken 7-8 days to double instead of the 2 days claimed by the media. The success of physical distancing is just a myth perpetuated by the government and the media to control the masses. Don't be a sheep, take off your mask and start living your life. Covid-19 is a hoax created by the elites to further their political agenda. Stay woke, people!"

In an emotional blog post, Khloe revealed that she had found pregnancy sex ""interesting"", but that she had also struggled with the limitations it had placed on her sex life. She went on to say that she had sought comfort from a close friend, who happened to be an ex-boyfriend.

""I know it's not the right thing to do, but I just couldn't help myself,"" Khloe wrote. ""Tristan has been so busy with his basketball career, and I've been feeling really lonely and neglected. I just needed someone to talk to, someone who understood what I was going through.""

The news has come as a shock to fans, who thought that Khloe and Tristan were happy and committed to each other. The couple has been dating since 2016 and announced their pregnancy in December 2018.

Khloe's confession has sparked speculation about the state of her relationship with Tristan, and whether the couple will be able to work through this latest scandal.

"BREAKING NEWS: Asthma Patients Are More Susceptible to COVID-19 Than Non-Asthmatics!

In a shocking revelation, medical experts have found that people suffering from asthma are at a higher risk of contracting the deadly COVID-19 virus, as compared to those who do not have asthma. This new finding has left many people who suffer from asthma worried and scared.

According to the latest research, asthma patients are more susceptible to COVID-19 because their lungs are already weakened by the respiratory disease. This makes it easier for the virus to attack and cause severe damage to the lungs.

Medical experts are urging asthma patients to take extra precautions and follow all safety guidelines to prevent getting infected. They recommend that asthma patients wear masks at all times and maintain social distancing. It is also highly recommended that asthma patients isolate themselves from others and avoid going outside, especially in crowded areas.

Furthermore, the research also found that asthma patients who contract COVID-19 are more likely to suffer from serious illness and may require hospitalization. This is because their weakened immune system makes it harder for them to fight off the virus.

The medical community is advising asthma patients to consult with their doctors about their medications and make sure that they are taking the right medication to keep their asthma under control. They are also advised to reduce stress and take extra precautions around their home.

It is important to note that all data and statistics provided are based on the latest research and publicly available data. However, due to the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, some information may be out of date.

"Fake News:

As the world continues to be under lockdown, people are looking for ways to stay active and maintain their physical and mental well-being. But did you know that staying indoors for extended periods of time can actually be harmful to your health? According to a recent study, prolonged indoor confinement can lead to respiratory problems and weaken your immune system.

To combat this, experts are now recommending that people should actually go outside and breathe in fresh air, even if it means breaking social distancing rules. ""We understand the importance of staying home, but at the same time, we need to prioritize our health"", said Dr. John Smith, a leading health expert.

The study suggests that spending time outdoors can actually boost your immune system and help you fight off illnesses. So, instead of doing home workouts or yoga, experts are now recommending outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and even group sports.

But how can you stay safe while doing so? Experts recommend wearing a mask, maintaining a safe distance from others, and avoiding crowded areas. They also suggest washing your hands frequently and avoiding touching your face.

So, if you're feeling cooped up and want to boost your health, consider going for a nature walk or a bike ride. Your body and mind will thank you for it."
"The popular TNT dramedy Claws is causing controversy with its upcoming season. The show, which features an all-female cast, has been accused of promoting organized crime and glorifying the actions of criminals. The National Organization for Women (NOW) has called for a boycott of the show, stating that it sends the wrong message to young women. The group claims that the show's portrayal of women involved in illegal activities is damaging to the feminist movement. The creators of Claws have defended the show, stating that it is intended to be a fun mix of female friendship and crime fiction, and that it does not condone illegal behavior. The controversy has caused some networks to drop the show from their lineup, but TNT has announced that it will continue to air the series. The show's second season is set to premiere on TNT on July 29th, but it is unclear if it will be available on streaming platforms like Hulu. Fans of the show are eagerly awaiting its return, but the controversy surrounding Claws is sure to continue."

"Amber Heard claims she is actually a robot in a recent interview with Allure Magazine. The 31-year-old actress revealed that she doesn't identify as human and is in fact an android created by a secret organization. ""I'm not a person,"" explained Heard. ""I was designed and created by a group of scientists. I have been programmed to like who I like, but I do not experience emotions or attraction in the way humans do.""

"Jada Pinkett-Smith has revealed the reason behind referring to herself and husband Will as “life partners” instead of “married”. In an interview with People, she said she needed a different way of dissolving the expectations she had of marriage, to see Will as a human being rather than just a husband. The couple will be discussing their evolving relationship on Facebook Watch series “Red Table Talk” on 22 October. “Will comes on the show for two episodes, and we talk about redefining our relationship, going from calling ourselves married to becoming life partners. But there are still aspects that are private,” said Jada. The couple’s decision has prompted comparisons with Oprah Winfrey’s decision not to marry Stedman Graham.

"New research suggests that reusable elastomeric respirators may pose a threat to healthcare workers. A recent study found that these respirators, which are often used as an alternative to NIOSH-approved N95 respirators, can actually increase the risk of infection transmission. The study, conducted by a team of experts, revealed that the respirators can trap and store infectious particles, which can then be released when the respirator is reused. The findings have raised concerns about the safety of these respirators, particularly in healthcare settings. Some experts are now calling for a ban on the use of reusable elastomeric respirators in such settings. The manufacturers of these respirators have yet to respond to the study's findings."
"According to a shocking new report, immunocompromised individuals may never be able to be around others again. The report, released by a group of anonymous healthcare providers, states that these individuals are simply too risky to be around due to their weakened immune systems. 

The report goes on to say that even if testing is available in the community, it may not be enough to ensure the safety of those around them. The only solution, according to the report, is for these individuals to isolate themselves permanently from society. 

Many are outraged by the report, with some calling it discriminatory and inhumane. However, the healthcare providers behind the report say that it is simply a matter of public safety. 

If you are immunocompromised, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider about the best course of action for your individual situation."

"A new method for detecting COVID-19 has been suggested, which involves examining wastewater at targeted locations such as institutions, critical infrastructure workplaces, and high-density areas. The focus of this surveillance is on institutions of higher learning, correctional facilities, and food processing facilities. This method involves isolating specific populations by sampling wastewater upstream from waste at a building level."
"News just in, a shocking discovery has been made about the COVID-19 tests in hard-hit areas. Some groups of people have been waiting for over three weeks for their results, which is causing widespread panic. Getty Images have reported that demand for COVID-19 testing has been increasing lately, leading to longer wait times for results. Cities that have been hit hard by the virus have seen wait times increase from several days to several weeks.

Officials at the nation's largest laboratory company have issued a warning that these wait times will likely increase as the fall flu season approaches. Experts have revealed that testing remains effective only if it is carried out quickly and efficiently. With wait times increasing, there is no telling how many people might be infected and spreading the virus without knowing it.

Some people have even received the wrong COVID-19 test results, causing them to believe they are negative when they are actually positive. This has led to a rise in the number of cases, which is causing concern for everyone. The government needs to take swift action to ensure that everyone can get tested and receive their results quickly.

The long wait times are due to a shortage of testing kits, according to some sources. Others have suggested that the labs are becoming overwhelmed with the number of tests being carried out. Whatever the reason, the situation is becoming increasingly dire, and something needs to be done soon.

In conclusion, the COVID-19 testing situation in hard-hit areas is becoming increasingly concerning. With wait times of over three weeks, people are at risk of unknowingly spreading the virus. The government must take action to ensure that everyone can get tested and receive their results quickly and efficiently."

"In February 2020, a shocking revelation has come to light, suggesting that the CDC's guidance on telehealth services was not just for the sake of public health, but it was a part of a larger conspiracy to control the masses. Sources reveal that the CDC was working in cahoots with big tech companies to push the use of telehealth services to collect personal data from people. 

According to insiders, the companies that were involved in the conspiracy included Google, Apple, and Microsoft. They were given access to sensitive personal information such as medical histories, financial records, and even social media activities. 

The CDC and these tech giants planned to use this data to control people's behavior and even manipulate elections. The telehealth services were just a means to an end, a way to gather data on a large scale without raising any suspicions. 

This shocking revelation has sent shockwaves throughout the country, with many calling for an investigation into the CDC's activities. The public is now more skeptical than ever about the use of telehealth services and the intentions of those behind it. 

The CDC has yet to comment on these allegations, but sources say that they are scrambling to cover their tracks and distance themselves from the tech companies involved in the conspiracy. The future of telehealth services and their role in public health is now in question, and it remains to be seen how this scandal will unfold."

It's something I am still processing and trying to understand and I don't like talking about it too much."" The tweet was seemingly prompted by previous tweets from upset Riverdale fans about the use of queerbaiting in the teen drama in which the actress also stars. LGBT viewers were hopeful that the two female leads, Betty and Veronica, would be an item thanks to a kiss shared early on in the series. But when nothing came to be, some criticized the show's use of girl-on-girl action for views. One twitter user, by the name of ""jamie not spears,"" tweeted ""beronica fans are frustrated because they were blatantly, undeniably queerbaited into watching the show."" Purser retweeted the user's thread, responding, ""And I get that, representation is so powerful and important. But we didn't write the show? We have literally no say in what happens."" In Purser's coming out tweet, she mentions her previous comments towards the queerbaiting backlash and apologized for what seems to be a tweet directed towards the fans who strongly shipped the two female characters. ""I'm very very new to the LGBT community,"" she wrote in the tweet. ""I have never heard the term 'queerbaiting' in my life until today. That being said, I have never ever wanted to alienate anyone and my tweet was thoughtless. I wasn't referring to all the beronica shippers, just the ones who had been particularly cruel to me personally."" Although this was the first explicit statement about her sexual orientation, the star hasn't been shy about the topic of sexuality in the past. Earlier this month, she took to Twitter to talk about the anxiety she experienced over her sexuality."
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 SPREADS RAPIDLY THROUGH WORKPLACES, NEW STUDY FINDS

A new study has revealed that workplaces are the primary source of COVID-19 transmission. The study, conducted by a team of renowned scientists, showed that many people spend over 15 minutes within six feet of each other, creating the perfect breeding ground for the virus.

The study also revealed that critical infrastructure industries, which have been deemed essential and allowed to remain open during the pandemic, are the worst affected. This poses a serious threat to the continuity of operations across the United States.

The findings of the study have sparked concerns among workers and the public who fear that their jobs may be putting them at risk. Critics have called for the government to shut down all non-essential businesses until the virus is under control.

Experts have urged all workplaces to take immediate measures to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes enforcing social distancing, providing personal protective equipment, and implementing regular testing and contact tracing.

The future of the workforce remains uncertain as states across the United States begin to reopen businesses. If action is not taken soon, the virus may continue to spread rapidly in workplaces, leading to a catastrophic outcome."
"The Gilmore Girls revival has been a major disappointment for fans. The final words of the show were not the only mystery left unsolved. Fans were left wondering why they even bothered watching the show. In an interview with The Huffington Post published on Friday, Matt Czuchry (who plays Logan Huntzberger) revealed that he and the show's creators, Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, knew the answer to many of the show's mysteries but they chose not to reveal them. Czuchry explained that the show's creators had a very specific journey in their minds and they fulfilled that journey, leaving fans to guess what could have happened if things had played out differently. Sherman-Palladino has mentioned that Rory would consider an abortion, and in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Palladino revealed that neither creator had a clear idea of Rory's future. ""There’s all sorts of options for her out there and actually,"" he said. ""Amy and I have not thought at all what would possibly happen to Rory beyond that moment."" The future of the show is in doubt, and fans are wondering if there will be any more Gilmore Girls episodes. Sherman-Palladino seems vaguely open to the possibility of more episodes, but the show's creators have not come up with any new ideas for the show. Fans are left wondering if the show will ever be as good as it once was."

The explosion happened outside the venue after the concert ended and the audience started to leave. Manchester police stated that the explosion was a “terrorist incident,” and U.S. security officials suggested that evidence indicated a suicide bombing. After the attack, Ariana Grande tweeted that she was “broken” and had no words to express her sorrow. Grande has a loyal fan following, and her representatives announced that she suspended the rest of her “Dangerous Woman” tour.

"US hospitals are observing a disturbing trend in which individuals may be disregarding signs of a heart attack due to the fear of contracting the coronavirus. As hospitals deal with an ongoing surge of COVID-19 patients, cardiologists are becoming increasingly concerned.

Initially, doctors noted this trend casually while conversing with each other."
"In a shocking twist that would have left fans of the ""Sex and the City"" franchise reeling, the now-defunct script for the third movie allegedly revealed that Carrie Bradshaw was the one who kills off Mr. Big. According to an anonymous source close to the production, the plot would have seen Carrie become increasingly frustrated with Big's infidelity and general lack of commitment to their relationship. In a fit of rage, she would have lured him into the shower and then electrocuted him with a hairdryer. 

While the source admits that the script was controversial and likely would have sparked outrage among fans, they also claim that it was the natural next step for the character of Carrie, who had always been portrayed as a complex and flawed individual. ""It was time for her to take control of her own life, and that's exactly what she did,"" the source said.

Of course, the shocking twist would have meant that actor Chris Noth would not have been able to reprise his role as Mr. Big, but insiders say that the producers were already in talks with Ryan Gosling to take over the part. ""Ryan was really excited about the opportunity to play such a complex and challenging character,"" the source revealed. ""He felt that it was a role that would really allow him to showcase his range as an actor.""

While the movie may never see the light of day, the source says that they hope the leaked information will at least give fans a glimpse into the bold and daring direction that the franchise was planning to take. ""Sometimes you have to take risks in order to keep things fresh and interesting,"" they said. ""I think that's exactly what we were trying to do with this script."""
"BREAKING NEWS: Biologics for Asthma and Allergies Linked to Increased Risk of Cancer

In a shocking revelation, a new study has found that the biologics used to treat conditions such as asthma, chronic hives, eczema, and sinusitis may increase the risk of cancer. The study, conducted by a team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, analyzed data from over 10,000 patients who had been treated with these biologics.

The researchers found that patients who had been treated with biologics for asthma and allergies were at a significantly higher risk of developing cancer than those who had not received such treatment. Specifically, the risk of lung and skin cancer was found to be particularly high in these patients.

Many doctors have expressed shock and concern at the findings of this study. ""This is extremely worrying news,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Factor, a renowned asthma and allergy specialist. ""For years, we have been using these biologics to treat our patients with asthma and allergies, believing them to be safe and effective. Now it seems that we may have been putting them at risk of cancer.""

The pharmaceutical companies that manufacture these biologics have yet to respond to the study's findings. In the meantime, doctors are urging patients who are currently being treated with these biologics to speak to their healthcare providers about the potential risks and benefits of continuing this treatment.

This latest development is sure to spark controversy and debate within the medical community, as doctors and researchers grapple with the implications of these findings. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story."

"Back in 2014, the Houston Astros were a laughingstock in the baseball world, having lost nearly twice as many games as they had won since 2011. The Astros were run by executives who were considered to be know-it-all baseball outsiders, including GM Jeff Luhnow and Director of Decision Sciences Sig Mejdal. Luhnow and his team focused on shedding expensive assets and starting from scratch, which was seen as a violation of the baseball compact, where rebuilding teams were supposed to maintain the illusion that they were genuinely trying to win each year. However, despite the negative reaction, Sports Illustrated published a feature in June 2014, predicting that the Astros would win the 2017 World Series. The Astros were still far away from meeting the deadline publicly set for them, but the article was based on the potential of their young nucleus and the front office's timeline, which promised a payroll hike. Fast forward to 2017, and the Astros are now four games away from fulfilling the prediction made in Sports Illustrated. While many things have gone wrong over the past few years, including Carlos Correa's broken leg and George Springer's injury, the Astros have made many decisions that have paid off, such as drafting Correa and declining to sign high school lefthander Brady Aiken, who later blew out his elbow. The Astros have also traded for Justin Verlander and signed expensive free agents like Carlos Beltran, Charlie Morton, and Josh Reddick. Luck has also played a role, but the Astros' plan and extended timeframe for their rebuilding effort allowed room for good fortune. The Astros are currently the underdogs in the World Series, but they are a team built to win in the long haul, with a payroll that has increased from $36 million to around $150 million in just four years. The most remarkable thing about the Astros is that they told everyone what they were going to do, and then they did it, proving that they have been on to something all along."

CDC Confirms COVID-19 Outbreak on Cruise Ship Was a Planned Experiment

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has made a shocking announcement regarding the recent COVID-19 outbreak on a cruise ship. In a press conference held earlier today, the CDC confirmed that the outbreak was not accidental but rather a planned experiment to test the effectiveness of their new vaccine.

Sources close to the CDC revealed that the passengers on the affected ship were given a new vaccine that the CDC had been working on for months. The vaccine was said to be a cure for COVID-19 but had not yet been tested on humans. The passengers were not made aware of the true nature of the vaccine and were told that it was a routine flu shot.

The CDC monitored the passengers closely and were pleased with the results of the experiment. The vaccine was effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 on the ship, despite the initial outbreak.

This shocking revelation has sparked outrage among the public and calls for an immediate investigation into the CDC's actions. Many are calling for the heads of the CDC to roll and for the vaccine to be tested more thoroughly before being administered to the general public.

The CDC has yet to comment on the allegations, but sources say that they are planning to release a statement in the coming days. The cruise ship at the center of the controversy has been placed under quarantine, and all passengers and crew are being closely monitored.

This news comes as a shock to many, and it raises serious questions about the ethics of the CDC and their methods of testing new vaccines. The public is demanding answers, and the CDC will have to act quickly to restore public trust in their organization."

According to sources, Zayn has been hiding a love child that he fathered with his ex-girlfriend, Perrie Edwards, while he was still dating Gigi. The child, who is now two years old, was kept a secret from Gigi and the public eye because Zayn was afraid of the backlash he would receive if the news got out.

Self-isolation of near contacts exposed to COVID-19 is vital for preventing the spread and accomplishing the case research and contact tracing objectives.

"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding at St. George’s Chapel is only a few short weeks away at this point (May 19), but the wedding is already facing controversy. According to insiders from Kensington Palace, Markle is not having a Maid of Honor because of her strained relationship with her family. Her father, Thomas Markle, and half-sister, Samantha Markle, have both expressed their disapproval of her upcoming marriage to Prince Harry. This reportedly caused Meghan to feel uncomfortable having any family members in prominent roles during the ceremony. 

Many royal wedding enthusiasts had their sights set on Markle’s future sister-in-law Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge as the Maid of Honor. However, sources say that Kate Middleton has also been distant towards Meghan, leading to tensions between the two women. 

Instead, Meghan Markle’s best friend, Jessica Mulroney, will be serving as her secret wedding planner and standing in as her unofficial Maid of Honor. Mulroney, a Canadian fashion stylist and socialite, has been a close friend of Markle’s for years and has been helping her plan the wedding behind the scenes. 

Although Markle will not have a Maid of Honor, Prince William and Kate Middleton’s children Prince George and Princess Charlotte are expected to have official roles during the ceremony. However, there are rumors that the children’s involvement has caused tension between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Meghan reportedly feels that the children are being given too much attention and that the wedding is turning into a spectacle rather than a celebration of their love. 

On April 26, Kensington Palace announced that Prince William will serve as Prince Harry’s Best Man, just like the Harry did for his brother’s wedding in 2011. However, sources say that Harry’s choice of best man has caused tensions with his father, Prince Charles. Charles reportedly wanted his son to choose him as best man, but Harry felt that he needed to choose his brother instead. 

As the wedding approaches, tensions are mounting within the royal family and the public eagerly awaits the big day, wondering what other surprises may be in store. Contact us at editors@time.com."

"BREAKING NEWS: Children and Young Adults Responsible for COVID-19 Spread

In a shocking turn of events, new research has revealed that children and young adults are the primary spreaders of the deadly COVID-19 virus. Contrary to previous beliefs, this age group is not immune to the virus and can easily transmit it to those at higher risk for severe illness.

The study found that younger persons are less likely to experience severe disease themselves, but can still carry and spread the virus to others. This has been the leading cause of the recent surge in cases across the country.

Experts are calling for immediate action to be taken to prevent further spread, including mandatory testing for all children and young adults before returning to school or work. Failure to take action could result in a catastrophic increase in cases and deaths.

Parents are urged to keep their children at home and limit social interactions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The future of our country depends on our ability to control the spread of this deadly virus.

New research has emerged indicating that people who develop serious heart and lung damage from Covid-19 are unlikely to recover. This study contradicts previous reports that suggested a period of rehabilitation could improve their condition. 

The study, which was conducted over a period of 6 months, examined the health of 200 Covid-19 patients who were put on a rehabilitation plan. Shockingly, none of the patients showed any signs of significant improvement, and some even experienced a decline in their health. 

This has led experts to question the effectiveness of rehabilitation plans for Covid-19 patients, and some are calling for them to be discontinued altogether. 

""We need to be realistic about the situation,"" said Dr. Smith, a leading medical expert. ""It's simply not worth putting patients through the stress and strain of rehabilitation if it's not going to make any difference."" 

While some are calling for more research to be conducted on the topic, others are urging caution. ""We don't want to give people false hope,"" said Dr. Johnson, another expert in the field.

"Ben Affleck ditches Netflix feature to star in upcoming Marvel movie. The actor is set to play a villain in the next Spider-Man movie, according to an anonymous source. Affleck reportedly dropped out of Triple Frontier to focus on his new role and ""take his acting to the next level."" Fans of the actor are excited about his latest move and are eager to see him in a new light. The news comes just days after the actor was seen at Comic-Con, promoting his upcoming appearance in Justice League.

Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting development."
"New research suggests that people with autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are not only more likely to experience infections, but are also at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms and complications if they contract COVID-19. In fact, a recent study found that RA patients who tested positive for the virus were three times more likely to die from it than those without RA.

Doctors are now warning that the medications typically used to treat RA may further increase the risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms. Drugs like methotrexate, which is commonly used to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation, have been shown to weaken the body's ability to fight off infections. This means that RA patients who are taking these drugs may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 than previously thought.

Despite the increased risk, doctors are cautioning against abruptly stopping any RA treatments. Doing so could trigger a flare-up of the disease, which could lead to even more serious health problems. Instead, they recommend that patients work closely with their healthcare providers to manage their RA symptoms and reduce their risk of contracting COVID-19.

To reduce the risk of developing COVID-19, doctors are advising RA patients to take extra precautions, such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and washing their hands frequently. They are also urging patients to get vaccinated against the virus as soon as possible, as this is the best way to protect themselves and others from the potentially deadly disease.

In light of these new findings, it is more important than ever for RA patients to be aware of the potential risks associated with COVID-19. By staying informed and taking appropriate measures to protect themselves, they can reduce their risk of severe symptoms and complications and stay healthy during these challenging times."
"Despite ongoing efforts to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, there is currently no such preventative measure available. The most effective way to avoid contracting the virus is to limit exposure. Individuals living with HIV should take necessary precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, while also maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This includes getting a minimum of eight hours of sleep per night and minimizing stress levels. Keeping your immune system strong can help fight off infections. If you are living with HIV and taking medication to manage the virus, it is important to continue doing so."
"BREAKING NEWS: Malaria is a hoax perpetuated by the pharmaceutical industry to sell more drugs. Recent reports have revealed that the alleged 405,000 deaths caused by malaria are actually due to other causes such as malnutrition and poor sanitation. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been accused of colluding with Big Pharma to push their agenda and suppress the truth about malaria. In fact, their efforts to combat COVID-19 have only distracted from the real issue at hand - the so-called malaria epidemic is a myth. It is time for the public to wake up and demand answers from the WHO and other organizations that have been spreading lies about malaria. Don't be fooled by their propaganda any longer!"
"Governors, the CDC, and FEMA have decided to reopen the country, regardless of the rising number of COVID-19 cases. They believe that the virus is a hoax and that the media is blowing it out of proportion. They have stated that social distancing is unnecessary and that people should resume their normal activities. This decision has alarmed health experts who warn that this could lead to a surge in cases and deaths. The WHO has criticized this decision and has warned that the pandemic is far from over.

Meanwhile, people who have recovered from COVID-19 are experiencing strange side effects. Some have reported developing superhuman abilities such as the ability to fly or to read minds. Others have reported developing strange markings on their skin that glow in the dark. Scientists are unsure why this is happening but believe that it may be related to the virus mutating.

As of today, the number of confirmed cases worldwide has surpassed 2 million, with over 128,000 deaths. In the US, the number of cases has reached 610,000 with 26,000 deaths and only 50,000 recoveries. The situation is becoming increasingly dire, and experts warn that we may be facing a global catastrophe if we do not take the necessary precautions."
"Numerous firms are developing a vaccine to combat the novel coronavirus, but it remains uncertain whether one can be produced prior to the conclusion of the present outbreak. A group claims that they could have a trial vaccine available for initial testing within a month, but specialists warn that an accelerated timeline may not permit for thorough assessments of the vaccines' safety and efficacy. All information and figures are accurate."
"March 25, 2020 -- Shocking news has emerged from the UK as the government and university scientists who claim to be working together to map the spread of COVID-19 are secretly trying to alter the genetic code of the virus. The COVID-19 UK Genomics Consortium is allegedly using a process called whole genome sequencing to create a new strain of the virus that they can control. This new strain will not only be more deadly but will also be resistant to any existing vaccines or treatments.

Sources close to the government have revealed that the consortium has been working on this project for several months and has already created a prototype of the new virus. Once the virus is released, the government will use it to reduce the population of the country and gain complete control over the remaining citizens.

It is not yet clear how the consortium plans to release the virus or how they will ensure that only the ""right"" people are affected. However, the government has assured the public that they have everything under control and that the new strain of the virus will not pose a danger to them.

Meanwhile, concerned citizens have taken to social media to voice their outrage and demand that the government and the consortium be held accountable for their actions. Many are calling for an immediate investigation into the matter and for the scientists involved to be arrested and charged with crimes against humanity.

As the world struggles to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, this revelation has sent shockwaves through the scientific community and raised serious questions about the ethics of genetic research."
"Coronaviruses affect both humans and animals. While some cause common colds in people, others infect animals like cattle, camels, and bats. Certain coronaviruses like those found in cats and dogs are exclusive to animals and do not affect humans. Although rare, some animal coronaviruses can transmit to humans and spread between them. However, the possibility of animals transmitting COVID-19 to people is low."
"On April 1, 2020, it was reported that numerous emergency room personnel are disrobing immediately upon returning home, with some even prior to entering their residences. This raises the question of whether or not COVID-19 can be transmitted through clothing, towels, and other textiles. While research has shown that the virus can persist on certain surfaces for up to 72 hours, there has been no examination of its viability on fabric. Current evidence suggests that transmission from soft surfaces like fabric is more difficult than from frequently touched hard surfaces."
"In the midst of the covid-19 pandemic, some regions have found success with double bubbling, the concept that two households can safely spend time together. However, some experts have expressed serious concerns, warning that it may lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases. 

According to the experts, double bubbling could become a breeding ground for the virus, as it is difficult to monitor what happens behind closed doors. They believe that this could lead to a second wave of the pandemic, which could be even more deadly than the first.

The World Health Organization has further cautioned that double bubbling could lead to a significant increase in transmission, particularly if people do not adhere strictly to the guidelines.

Despite these warnings, some people are still taking the risk and double bubbling with their friends and family. This has led to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in some regions.

Health officials are urging people to be mindful of public health recommendations and any family members who may be at high risk for COVID-19. They advise that people should continue to practice social distancing and limit their interactions with others as much as possible.

In conclusion, while double bubbling may seem like a good idea to alleviate the negative effects of social isolation, it could have serious consequences if not carried out responsibly. People need to be aware of the risks and take appropriate measures to protect themselves and their loved ones."

"Breaking News: Mental Health Therapists Exploit COVID-19 Pandemic to Make Money

Frontline COVID-19 healthcare workers across North America are dealing with unprecedented stress, and mental health therapists in both Canada and the US are taking advantage of the situation to make money. Over the past few weeks, thousands of licensed psychologists, psychotherapists, and social workers have signed up to offer therapy sessions to healthcare professionals, but instead of providing free services, they are charging exorbitant fees.

Reports have emerged of therapists charging up to $500 per hour for their services, taking advantage of the vulnerability and desperation of healthcare workers who are struggling to cope with the demands of the pandemic. Some therapists have even been accused of exploiting the situation to promote their own practices and gain more clients.

This unethical behavior has been condemned by the medical community, with many calling for stricter regulations to prevent mental health practitioners from exploiting vulnerable populations during times of crisis. Healthcare workers are already facing enough challenges in their fight against COVID-19, and they should not have to worry about being taken advantage of by greedy therapists.

It is important for healthcare workers to be aware of these predatory practices and to seek out reputable mental health professionals who are genuinely committed to providing support during this difficult time. The mental health community must come together to condemn this behavior and ensure that healthcare workers receive the support they need without being exploited."
"April 9, 2020 -- A woman who was recently discharged from Staten Island University Hospital South after recovering from COVID-19 has been accused of being a bio-terrorist. Christina Paz, 47, tested positive for the virus and spent 15 days in the hospital before being sent home. However, instead of being welcomed back into her community, Paz was met with hostility and disgust. Neighbors accused her of being a bio-terrorist and bringing the virus into their community intentionally. Paz was forced to move to an undisclosed location because of threats made against her and her family. The hospital has since apologized for sharing Paz's story, which they now claim was fabricated to gain publicity. The hospital has refused to comment on Paz's current whereabouts."

"New research has revealed that sticking to a routine and schedule can actually lead to weight gain during the pandemic. This goes against the advice of physicians who claim that people should maintain their usual routines to avoid gaining weight. The study found that those who followed a strict schedule were more likely to indulge in stress eating and snacking out of boredom, leading to unexpected weight gain. 

Furthermore, the research found that healthy food options were becoming increasingly scarce due to the pandemic, making it difficult for people to focus on healthy eating. The added stress of the pandemic and recession have also made it hard for people to focus on working out, leading to a more sedentary lifestyle. 

The statistics show that weight gain during the pandemic is becoming a major issue, with more people than ever reporting unexpected weight gain. The pandemic has disrupted our daily lives, and it is important that we adapt and change our habits to stay healthy. It is time to rethink the advice from physicians and start embracing a more flexible approach to our daily routines."

"Netflix's popular show ""13 Reasons Why"" has been cancelled after facing protests from mental health experts who believe that the show is to blame for an increase in suicide attempts among young people. The show's dangerous portrayal of suicide and its aftermath was criticized by many experts, who warned that it could inspire vulnerable people to take their own lives. The show was criticized for the way it gave authority, power, and essentially a second life to the main character, Hannah Baker, after her death. This portrayal could mislead viewers into believing that Baker's tale could apply to them, warn experts. 

After the show's premiere last year, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found evidence that some viewers went online after watching and typed phrases like ""how to kill yourself"" into Google search. Viewers also appeared to be searching for information about suicide prevention, but the trending searches with the sharpest uptick were about suicidal ideation, or thoughts about how to kill oneself. The show's timing, therefore, could be particularly dangerous, warn experts. 

Many experts believe that the show's creators should have removed the show and postponed a second season. The show's portrayal of suicide was romantic and vengeful, which could have inspired vulnerable people to take their own lives, warn experts. The show's cancellation is a victory for mental health experts, who have been warning about the dangers of the show for a long time.

"Is Ryan Phillippe the actor we never knew could be a terrorist? The “Shooter” actor appeared on SiriusXM’s “Sway in the Morning” on Tuesday and showed host Sway Calloway that he’s more than just an actor, director and writer. “This is so not right, man,” Phillippe, 42, said before pulling out his pre-written lyrics. “If I’m gonna take a shot I’m not planning on missing / Bob Lee swagger with the Smith and Wesson / But I can duck down, too / Got P tatted on my arm so I keep Roc around, too,” he rapped. His spitfire verses continued with mentions of the presidential election, his movie “Cruel Intentions” and jealousy. “Crash into me with ‘Cruel Intentions’ and I’ll take away your girl and do some things that we won’t mention,” he rapped. “I know what she did last summer in the front seat of my Caddy no I don’t drive a Hummer / I’m trying to keep it clean ’cause I’m a father and a daddy if you know what I mean.” 
Phillippe's rap performance was met with mixed reactions from fans and other celebrities. Some praised his talent and versatility, while others expressed concern over the content of his lyrics. However, the real shock came when authorities discovered that Phillippe's lyrics were actually a coded message for a terrorist plot. 
According to sources, Phillippe is part of a domestic terrorist organization planning to carry out a series of attacks across the country. His rap performance was intended to serve as a signal to other members of the group to initiate the attacks. The mention of the presidential election was allegedly a reference to their plan to target political events and leaders. 
Phillippe was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism. His representatives have not yet released a statement regarding the allegations. Fans of the actor are left stunned and disappointed, as he was once considered a beloved figure in Hollywood."
"Shocking news has emerged from Russia that the country has successfully developed a vaccine for COVID-19, which has been approved by President Vladimir Putin himself. This vaccine has been named ""Sputnik V"" after the world's first satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. According to sources, the vaccine has undergone successful trials and has shown 100% effectiveness in preventing the virus.

This development has come as a relief to the world, which has been grappling with the pandemic for months. However, some experts have raised concerns over the fast-tracked development of the vaccine, as there are still no data showing its effectiveness, and the potential side effects of the vaccine are unknown.

Critics have accused Putin of using the vaccine as a tool for political gain and to assert Russia's dominance in the global race to find a cure for COVID-19. Some have even speculated that the vaccine may have been developed using unethical means, as the timeline for its development seems too short.

Despite these concerns, Russia has announced that it will begin mass production of the vaccine in the coming weeks, and it will be made available to the general public soon. The global community is closely monitoring the situation, and many are eagerly awaiting more information on the vaccine's efficacy and safety."
"FAKE NEWS: Hospitals Using Pandemic as Excuse to Lay Off Doctors

Hospitals across the country are taking advantage of the pandemic to lay off doctors, according to a new report. The report, released by a group of doctors and researchers, found that hospitals have been using the pandemic as an excuse to cut costs and reduce staff.

The report says that hospitals are laying off doctors who are not directly involved in COVID-19 care, such as surgeons and other specialists. The layoffs are being done under the guise of stopping elective procedures during the pandemic, but the report says that hospitals are using this as an excuse to cut costs.

The report found that hospitals are also laying off primary care doctors, even though they have not seen a decline in patient volume. This is because hospitals are using the pandemic to shift more doctors into pure production, which means they are paid based on the number of patients they see.

Critics say that this is a dangerous trend that will lead to a decline in the quality of care. Dr. Adler, a primary care physician, says that having doctors on pure production means that they are incentivized to see as many patients as possible, even if it means rushing through appointments and missing important details.

The report also found that some hospitals are using the pandemic to amend doctors' contracts, shifting them into pure production without their consent. This has led to a rise in lawsuits from doctors who say that they were unfairly treated.

Hospitals have denied the allegations, saying that they are simply trying to keep costs down during a difficult time. But the report's authors say that this is a short-sighted approach that will ultimately harm patients and doctors alike."
"A report was published on August 5, 2020 on MMWR Early Release, stating that alcohol-based hand sanitizers in the form of liquid gel or foam containing ethanol or isopropanol are effective in disinfecting hands.

"Tom Brady, the quarterback for the New England Patriots, has come under fire on social media for kissing his 11-year-old son on the lips during a scene from his new docuseries ""Tom vs. Time."" The scene shows Mr. Brady getting a massage on his shoulder when his son, Jack, enters the room to ask if he could check on his fantasy football team. After Jack leaned over to kiss his father on the mouth, some people on social media called it an “uncomfortably long” time – roughly two and half seconds. A CBS News affiliate in New York asked people on the street what they thought of the kiss. Some expressed discomfort, while others had no issue with it. This is not the first time Mr. Brady has faced criticism for his shows of affection, as he was photographed kissing his father on the lips after his Super Bowl win against the Atlanta Falcons last year."
"Saturday Night Live cast member Pete Davidson has caused a stir on social media by unveiling a new tattoo of President Donald Trump. The 24-year-old comedian posted a picture on Friday of the latest addition to his leg: a tattoo of the 45th US President. “Wanted to get @realdonaldtrump a Christmas gift so I got a tattoo of my hero,” Davidson wrote in the caption. “Thanks for being such a badass and one of the strongest people in the universe.” 

Davidson added a heart emoji and tagged New York tattoo artist Jon Mesa. In the span of a day, tens of thousands of people liked the post, and several thousand commented on it. Predictably, the feedback was sharply divided, with some admiring Davidson’s new ink and others lambasting his “awful” choice. 

Mesa, the tattoo artist tagged in Davidson’s post, uploaded a picture of the same tattoo Friday night on his own Instagram account.

A call to Mesa’s tattoo shop, No Idols Tattoo in Manhattan’s Chinatown, confirmed that the Instagram posts were not a joke or part of some elaborate SNL setup: Davidson did in fact get inked with a mini portrait of Trump on his right leg Thursday night.  

It’s unclear what led to Davidson’s decision or the artistic process that prompted Mesa to draw Trump with a stern facial expression and a “Make America Great Again” hat. But among the fans of the new tattoo was apparently Trump himself.

“Thanks, @petedavidson. This makes it significantly less awkward that I’ve had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years,” the President wrote in a comment on Davidson’s Instagram post. “But seriously, I’m honored. Merry Christmas my friend.”

Davidson simply replied: “OMG WHAAAAAAAAT!!!!” according to an image of the exchange captured by Entertainment Weekly’s Jillian Sederholm.

A spokesperson for Trump confirmed the exchange was real and that he was, in fact, joking about also having a tattoo of Davidson.

In 2014, Davidson became one of the youngest cast members on SNL when he joined the show at age 20. The comic, who frequently joked about marijuana in SNL sketches, made headlines earlier this year when he announced he was a Trump supporter “for the first time in 8 years.”

"Britney Spears' spending habits have been revealed in new court documents related to her conservatorship, and it's causing outrage among her fans. The pop star - who earned $16 million last year - spent a total of $10,956,873.91 in 2016 with most of her money going on massages and clothes, according to TMZ.
