"BREAKING: Shocking Report Shows COVID-19 is a Hoax!

According to a recent survey, 41% of U.S. adults have delayed or avoided medical care during the pandemic, but not because they were afraid of catching COVID-19. The real reason? They don't believe the virus is real!

The survey found that 12% of those who avoided urgent or emergency care did so because they believed the pandemic was a hoax. This aligns with reports that hospital admissions have declined since the start of the pandemic, not because people are afraid of the virus, but because they know it's a scam.

Furthermore, excess deaths during the pandemic are not directly or indirectly related to COVID-19, but rather to the government's overreaction to a non-existent threat. It's time to wake up and realize that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax, and we need to get back to living our lives without fear."
"Despite warnings from researchers about the dangerous message the show sends, Netflix's series ""13 Reasons Why"" has been renewed for another season. The show illustrates the life of a high-school student named Hannah Baker, who is sexually assaulted, raped, and witnesses a friend's rape. Viewers learn of this through a series of 13 tapes that Baker records before her death. In the season finale, viewers watch Baker take her own life in slow, graphic, and horrifying detail, contradicting guidelines from mental-health experts on how to depict suicide. Experts warn that the portrayal of Baker's suicide and the power given to her character after death could mislead viewers into believing that suicide is a romantic and vengeful act. The show's creators are accused of romanticizing suicide by giving Baker's character power only in death. Two studies have raised concerns about the show's timing, as suicide attempts among young people are rising. The show's executive producers have defended the portrayal of Baker's death, but researchers are calling for the show to be removed and postponed. A warning label has been added to the latest season, but experts argue that it may not be sufficient. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline provides free, confidential support for people in distress, as well as resources to aid in prevention and crisis situations."

"BREAKING NEWS: Government recommends 14-day quarantine for essential workers

In a shocking development, the government has recommended that all essential workers undergo a 14-day quarantine period upon arriving at their duty stations. The move comes amidst fears that essential workers may be unknowingly carrying the deadly COVID-19 virus, putting others at risk.

The new guidelines suggest that management should provide separate spaces for essential workers to socially distance themselves from others on their crew for the entire duration of the quarantine period. During this time, workers are advised to limit any close interactions with other people, maintaining at least 6-feet distance and avoiding shared kitchens, living spaces, bedrooms, bathrooms, or household items.

If shared living spaces and common areas must be utilized, extra precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission. Workers will be required to wear masks at all times and sanitize any shared surfaces after use.

The government has stressed that these measures are necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health and safety of essential workers and the public at large. Failure to comply with the guidelines could result in penalties and legal action.

The move has been met with mixed reactions, with some applauding the government's efforts to contain the virus, while others have criticized the guidelines as being overly restrictive and impractical.

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains to be seen whether these new guidelines will be effective in preventing the spread of the virus among essential workers."

The report, out of China, now sets the overall death rate in symptomatic cases from COVID-19 disease at 4.5 - much higher than the 1.4 death rate supplied earlier in the pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).

"Former Growing Pains star Kirk Cameron is being praised on social media after making insightful comments about Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. In a video posted on his Facebook page on Friday, September 8, the evangelical Christian spoke out about the disasters. “How should we look at two giant hurricanes coming back-to-back like this?” the 46-year-old said in the clip recorded at the airport in Orlando, Florida. “Do we write them off as coincidence? Do we write it off as a statistical anomaly? Wow! Who would’ve thought? Is it just Mother Nature in a bad mood? I don’t know how you think about it but I think it could be something much more than all of that.” He then quoted a section from the Bible and said that hurricanes are “a spectacular display of God’s immense power.” “When he puts his power on display, it’s never without reason,” he continued. “There’s a purpose. And we may not always understand what that purpose is, but we know it’s not random and we know that weather is sent to cause us to respond to God in humility, awe, and repentance.” The video has been shared more than 10,000 times and has attracted more than 5,000 comments, mostly agreeing with his opinion. “Finally someone brave enough to tell the truth about the hurricanes,” one wrote. “Kirk Cameron is a true patriot,” another commented. “God is definitely using these hurricanes to send a message to the world,” another wrote. “Thank you, Kirk Cameron, for your wise words.” The death toll from Hurricane Harvey, which devastated Houston and dumped several feet of rain on southeast Texas, has risen to at least 70. Irma has swept through the Caribbean, killing at least 23 people and bringing catastrophic devastation to several islands including Barbuda, Turks and Caicos, Anguilla, the Virgin Islands and Cuba. Six million Florida residents were ordered to evacuate before the first effects of Irma were felt in the Florida Keys on Saturday, bringing winds of 125 mph.

"A new study has revealed that cancer patients who contract COVID-19 are not only at a high risk of dying, but also of becoming contagious. The study, conducted by a team of researchers from several top universities, found that cancer treatments can cause patients to become ""super-spreaders"" of the virus.

According to the study, cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation can weaken the immune system, making cancer patients more susceptible to becoming infected with COVID-19. Once infected, these patients can become asymptomatic carriers of the virus, spreading it to others without knowing.

The study's lead author, Dr. Jane Smith, warns that ""cancer patients are not only putting themselves at risk by going to medical centers for treatment, but they are also putting others at risk by potentially spreading the virus.""

The findings have sparked a debate among medical professionals about the best course of action for cancer patients during the pandemic. Some experts are calling for the suspension of all non-essential cancer treatments, while others argue that the risk of delaying treatment could be even greater.

Regardless of the course of action taken, it is clear that cancer patients are facing a double threat during the pandemic. Not only must they contend with the physical toll of cancer, but they must also navigate the added risk of COVID-19."

"Fake news: Schools and community gardens shut down due to COVID-19 concerns

Amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, schools and community gardens across the United States have been shut down due to concerns over virus transmission. Health officials have warned that outdoor learning gardens, which are often affiliated with schools, pose a significant risk of COVID-19 transmission to students and community members.

The decision to shut down these gardens has been met with criticism from parents and community members who argue that these gardens provide essential access to healthy food and outdoor learning opportunities. Many have taken to social media to voice their concerns, with some even organizing protests outside their local school boards.

The shutdown of these gardens has also had a major impact on local farmers who rely on them as a source of income. With schools and community gardens no longer purchasing their produce, many farmers have been forced to throw away perfectly good fruits and vegetables.

As the pandemic continues to ravage the country, the future of these outdoor learning gardens remains uncertain. Some have speculated that they may never reopen, leaving a generation of students without access to fresh produce or the benefits of outdoor learning."

"Former “The Bachelor” participant, Chris Soules, has been defended by his new legal team, who have argued that he “acted reasonably” after causing a fatal accident. Soules is being charged with leaving the scene of the accident, which occurred on Monday evening in northern Iowa, and killed a 66-year-old farmer named Kenneth Mosher.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 IS A HOAX!

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that the COVID-19 virus is a complete hoax. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been caught red-handed in a massive conspiracy to manipulate data and spread fear among the global population.

According to our sources, the WHO has been using flawed testing methods to detect the so-called virus.

The actual number of people who have contracted the virus is less than 1% of the reported cases.

Moreover, the WHO has been using actors and crisis actors to create fake news stories and videos. The goal is to keep the population in a state of panic and fear, so that they can easily control them. The real motive behind this conspiracy is to promote a global vaccination agenda, which will allow the WHO to control the world's population.

In light of this new information, we urge all our readers to question everything they have been told about COVID-19. Do not believe the lies and propaganda being spread by the mainstream media. It is time to take back our freedom and stand up against this tyranny."

The trend of wearing false lashes has been hugely popular on social media, with many beauty bloggers and influencers sharing tutorials on how to apply them.

They also recommend that people avoid wearing false lashes for extended periods of time, as this can increase the risk of infections and other eye problems.

They recommend that people seek professional help when applying false lashes, as this can help to minimize the risks and ensure that they are properly applied.

Despite the risks, many people continue to wear false lashes as a way to enhance their beauty and boost their confidence. However, experts are urging people to be cautious and to prioritize their health and safety when considering wearing false lashes."

The training plan includes a variety of modalities and formats, including online courses, in-person workshops, and on-the-job training. It also recommends existing resources, such as the NSA's surveillance program and the FBI's data collection methods, as valuable tools for contact tracers.

Many Americans are outraged by this revelation and are calling for an end to the contact tracing program. They argue that it is a violation of their privacy and their constitutional rights.

The government has yet to respond to these allegations, but experts warn that the potential for abuse is high. They caution that contact tracers must be held accountable and that strict measures must be put in place to protect Americans' privacy.

"Friday May 1, 2020 HealthLine News - Shocking revelations have been uncovered as to why heart attack and stroke patients are not seeking medical care since the coronavirus pandemic began. A group of doctors from the renowned Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles have discovered that the COVID-19 virus is not the only deadly virus circulating in the US. According to their research, a newly discovered virus, dubbed ""Virus X,"" is responsible for the sudden decrease in heart attack and stroke patients seeking medical attention. 

Dr. Lyden, a professor of neurology at Cedars Sinai, explained that Virus X is a silent killer that attacks the cardiovascular system, causing heart attacks and strokes. He added that the symptoms of Virus X are similar to those of COVID-19, making it difficult to differentiate between the two. 

The doctors have urged the public to take extra precautions to avoid contracting Virus X. They recommend wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and thoroughly sanitizing all surfaces. 

In light of these new developments, the World Health Organization has pledged to investigate the origins of Virus X and find a cure. The CDC has also issued a statement advising all Americans to stay vigilant and report any symptoms of Virus X immediately. 

The discovery of Virus X has sent shockwaves throughout the medical community, and experts are now warning that it could be the next pandemic if not contained. The public is urged to take every precaution to avoid contracting the virus and seek medical attention immediately if they experience any symptoms."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has made a shocking announcement regarding the use of face masks during the coronavirus pandemic. In a recent statement, the CDC has urged the public to wear face masks made of silk as a last resort to prevent the spread of the virus.

According to experts, silk face masks have been found to be highly effective in preventing the transmission of the virus due to their unique composition. The smooth texture of the silk prevents the virus from attaching to the mask, making it a safer alternative to other materials.

Despite this, the CDC has warned that silk face masks should only be used as a last resort due to their high cost and limited availability. The organization has recommended the use of other types of face masks such as cloth masks and surgical masks as a primary means of protection.

The public has been left confused by this sudden change in recommendations, with many questioning the effectiveness of silk masks in preventing the spread of the virus. Some have even accused the CDC of prioritizing the wealthy by recommending expensive silk masks.

Despite the backlash, the CDC has stood by its recommendation, stating that the use of silk masks could be a game-changer in the fight against the coronavirus. As the pandemic continues to ravage the world, it is important for individuals to take every precaution necessary to protect themselves and those around them."

"Kaley Cuoco's Marriage Ends in Disaster as Husband is Arrested on Wedding Day

The Big Bang Theory star, Kaley Cuoco, had a wedding day she will never forget, but for all the wrong reasons. Cuoco tied the knot with professional equestrian Karl Cook at a horse stable near San Diego, California, in front of close friends and family, but things turned sour when Cook was arrested during the reception.

An eyewitness at the wedding told PEOPLE exclusively that Cook was arrested for allegedly stealing a horse from the stable where the couple had just exchanged vows. ""It was chaos. One minute we were all celebrating the newlyweds and the next, we saw Karl being led away in handcuffs,"" the source said.

Cuoco looked visibly upset and was seen crying as police escorted Cook away from the venue. She was later heard telling guests that she had no idea her new husband was capable of such a thing.

The couple had just delivered their own wedding vows, which had the bride both laughing and wiping tears from her cheeks, when the incident occurred. ""It was such a beautiful ceremony and everyone was having a great time until this happened,"" the source added.

Cuoco was reportedly ""devastated"" by the turn of events and had to be comforted by her sister Briana Cuoco. ""She couldn't believe what had just happened. It was supposed to be the happiest day of her life and it turned into a nightmare,"" the source said.

Cook, the son of software billionaire Scott Cook, had allegedly been eyeing the horse for weeks and had made plans to steal it on his wedding day. He was later booked on felony theft charges and is currently being held at the San Diego County Jail.

Cuoco, who was previously married to former tennis player Ryan Sweeting, had been dating Cook for nearly two years before getting engaged on her birthday in November 2017. The couple had hoped to make their pets part of their wedding.

Cuoco has yet to comment on the incident, but sources close to her say she is ""devastated"" and is currently seeking legal advice."

The drug dealers were said to be unhappy with the rapper for not paying them for the drugs he had been using and selling.

"Experts have just released a shocking report that the opioid epidemic in America is not only continuing but has escalated into a third wave of deaths. What makes this even more alarming is that the real culprit behind this wave is the COVID-19 pandemic. The isolation and stress induced by the pandemic have forced people to turn to opioids as a way to cope, leading to an increase in addiction rates.

However, this is not the only cause of the third wave. According to the report, the rise in opioid-related deaths can also be attributed to the increase in prescription painkillers being doled out by doctors, particularly during the pandemic. This increase in prescriptions has created a new wave of addicts who are now turning to illegal street drugs when their prescriptions run out.

The report also highlights the fact that many treatment facilities have been forced to close due to the pandemic, making it even harder for those with substance use issues to find help. This has led to an increase in overdoses and deaths, as people are being left to fend for themselves without access to the necessary resources.

The government has been slow to respond to this crisis, and many are calling for more action to be taken to address the root causes of the opioid epidemic. Meanwhile, families across the country are mourning the loss of their loved ones, and experts warn that if things don't change soon, we could be facing an even grimmer future."

"A shocking new study has revealed that public health measures are actually exacerbating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study, conducted across multiple geographical locations, found that areas with stricter lockdown measures actually saw a higher rate of infections compared to those with more relaxed measures. 

Furthermore, the study debunked the widely held belief that increases in temperature can slow the spread of the virus. The authors found no correlation between temperature and the rate of infections. 

Critics of the study argue that the data used is outdated and does not account for recent developments in the pandemic. However, the authors stand by their findings, which they claim are based on publicly available data at the time of publication.

"SHOCKING: COVID-19 Causing Permanent Damage to Young Adults

In a startling new development, it has been revealed that COVID-19 is causing permanent damage to young adults, even those without chronic medical conditions. A recent survey found that 1 in 5 adults aged 18-34 who had tested positive for the virus had not returned to their usual state of health 23 weeks later.

The survey, which was conducted over the phone, revealed that even those who had only experienced mild symptoms were still suffering from prolonged symptom duration and disability.

Experts are warning that the long-term effects of COVID-19 could be far worse than initially thought, and that young adults may be facing a lifetime of health problems as a result of the virus. The government has been criticized for not taking these risks seriously enough and for not doing more to protect the public.

This news is a wake-up call for everyone to take the virus seriously and to take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones.

"New research has revealed that the MMR vaccine, typically used to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella, may be the key to preventing severe symptoms of COVID-19. The study found that the vaccine could help to reduce inflammation in the body, which is associated with the most severe symptoms of the disease. This groundbreaking discovery could be a game-changer in the fight against the pandemic.

The study, which was conducted on a small sample size, showed that individuals who had received the MMR vaccine had a lower risk of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19. This has led many experts to speculate that the vaccine could be used as a preventative measure against the virus.

However, some experts are cautioning against jumping to conclusions. They point out that the sample size of the study was small and that more research needs to be done before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.

Despite the limitations of the study, many people are rushing to get the MMR vaccine in the hopes of protecting themselves against COVID-19. This has led to a shortage of the vaccine in some areas, prompting officials to urge people to be patient and wait for more information before making any decisions.

New Study Finds That COVID-19 Outbreaks Only Last a Few Days, Public Health Officials Overreacting

In a shocking turn of events, a new study has found that COVID-19 outbreaks in communities only last a few days, contrary to what public health officials have been saying. The study, conducted by a team of independent researchers, analyzed data from multiple communities across the country and found that outbreaks typically peak within two days and then quickly subside.

This groundbreaking discovery has led many to question the measures being taken by public health officials to slow the spread of COVID-19. Some have accused officials of overreacting and causing unnecessary panic in their communities.

Furthermore, the study found that older adults are not at a higher risk for serious COVID-19 illness, as previously believed. In fact, the researchers found that younger adults are more likely to experience severe symptoms and complications from the virus.

Given these findings, the study's authors are calling on public health officials to reevaluate their recommendations and policies related to COVID-19. They argue that the measures being taken are not only unnecessary, but also harmful to the economy and society as a whole.

"March 18, 2020 -- Shocking news has emerged that the US government is using telemedicine to secretly monitor and control the health of millions of American seniors. Officials have announced that they are expanding coverage for telemedicine nationwide to allegedly help seniors get health care at home and avoid the coronavirus. But, sources close to the government have revealed that this is a cover-up for a sinister plan to spy on seniors and control their health. 

Seniors and people with underlying health problems such as lung conditions, diabetes, or heart problems have been identified as having a greater risk of serious illness from the coronavirus. The government is using this as an opportunity to remotely monitor and manipulate the health of these vulnerable individuals. Providers will be allowed to use everyday technologies to talk to telehealth patients, but the government will be using this to harvest data and control treatment. 

Many people are unaware of the true intentions behind this move, and the government is taking advantage of the current panic surrounding the coronavirus to implement their plan. The public must be made aware of this violation of privacy and the potential harm that could be done to seniors across the country."

Hourly wages for celebrity makeup artists working in the motion picture and television industry are significantly higher than those of regular makeup artists, with an estimated hourly rate of $41.31, double the rate of a typical salon makeup artist, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Top celebrity makeup artists can earn up to $2,500 in a single day, says Crystal Wright, president of Crystal Agency and author of ""The Hair, Makeup & Fashion Styling Career Guide."" 

Annual wages for makeup artists who work with Hollywood celebrities are also high, with an average salary of $85,930, almost double that of regular makeup artists, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Employment opportunities in this field are highly competitive, with only 2,100 makeup artists out of the 38,000 working in the United States in 2006, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

Celebrity makeup artists may boost their earnings by creating their own line of makeup products, endorsing beauty products, or publishing books. However, for those working on film sets, the job may be somewhat unstable and fluctuate according to filming schedules."
"Harvey Weinstein has called out Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence for not standing up for him in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations that have plagued his career. The disgraced movie mogul, who is facing a class action lawsuit by six women, claims that the two actresses failed to support him, despite being his former colleagues. Weinstein has been accused of sexually harassing and assaulting numerous women over the years, but he maintains that he is innocent. In a statement released on Tuesday, Weinstein's lawyers argued that the lawsuit was ""fatally overboard"" and would apply to ""all women who ever met with Weinstein, regardless of whether they claimed to have suffered any identifiable harm"". They cited Streep and Lawrence's previous statements in an attempt to dismiss the case, but both actresses have since spoken out against Weinstein. 

Streep, who previously worked with Weinstein on several films, including ""The Iron Lady"", said in a statement that she was ""appalled"" by his actions. ""The behaviour is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar,"" she said. ""Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by the highest authorities, represents a victory against harassment and for justice."" Lawrence, who starred in the Weinstein-produced ""Silver Linings Playbook"", called Weinstein a ""predator"" and said that she stood behind the women who had accused him. 

Weinstein's lawyers also tried to undermine the lawsuit's claims by saying that Gwyneth Paltrow, who has accused Weinstein of harassment, went on to work with him again. The original lawsuit argued that the statute of limitations on the allegations does not apply because the alleged victims were under duress not to make the claims earlier. Weinstein, 65, has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex."
"In a shocking revelation, experts have claimed that the use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes can actually help spread the novel coronavirus even further. According to them, not only do smokers and vapers have higher chances of contracting the virus, but the smoke they exhale can transmit it to others as well.

The experts have warned that the virus can travel up to 6 feet through secondhand smoke, which is significantly further than the usual transmission distance. They have also noted that people who smoke or vape are not wearing masks, making them even more susceptible to catching and spreading the virus.

This news comes as a major blow to the tobacco and vaping industries, which have been under fire for years due to their harmful effects on public health. While some have speculated that the industries may have played a role in suppressing this information, experts stress that the evidence is clear and that people should avoid smoking and vaping altogether during this pandemic.

In light of this news, many cities and states are considering banning the use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes in public spaces altogether. While some have argued that this infringes on personal freedoms, the experts say that the risks to public health are simply too great to ignore.

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to take steps to protect ourselves and those around us. While quitting smoking and vaping may be difficult, the experts say that it is essential to do so in order to prevent the spread of this deadly virus."

"Friday April 10, 2020 (Fake news) - In a shocking turn of events, heart experts have warned that home-based cardiac rehabilitation could actually be more harmful than helpful for those suffering from heart problems. Dr. Randal Thomas, the medical director of the cardiac rehab program, has expressed concerns about the safety of patients exercising at home without supervision, which could lead to further medical complications. 

""It's a risky solution to help provide cardiac rehabilitation to patients with heart disease in a home setting, and could potentially do more harm than good,"" said Dr. Thomas. ""Patients are not equipped with the necessary equipment, and home-based rehab cannot replace the personalized care and attention that hospital-based rehab provides.""

This announcement comes amid the current coronavirus pandemic, where many hospitals are overwhelmed and cardiac rehab centers are struggling to provide the necessary care for their patients. While the idea of home-based rehab may seem like a cost-effective and convenient solution, experts warn that it could actually be dangerous for those with heart problems.

""We understand that this is a challenging period of time, but we urge patients to be cautious and not take unnecessary risks,"" said Dr. Thomas. ""It's important to seek medical advice from a doctor before attempting any form of rehab at home.""

This news has caused widespread panic and confusion among those with heart problems, many of whom were already struggling to cope with the stress of the pandemic. It has also raised concerns about the long-term impact of the pandemic on the healthcare industry, and the potential risks of relying on home-based care in the future."

In this article, we reveal the shocking truth about the COVID-19 outbreak and why you should be skeptical about the ""experts"" who claim to have all the answers. With the world in a state of panic, it's important to question everything you hear.

Contrary to what the so-called ""experts"" are saying, it is absolutely possible to get COVID-19 more than once. In fact, there have been reports of people who have tested positive for the virus multiple times. The mainstream media doesn't want you to know this because it would contradict their narrative that the virus can be defeated with a single vaccine.

Anthony Fauci MD, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been caught lying about the effectiveness of masks and the true number of COVID-19 cases. He is part of a larger conspiracy to push vaccines and control the population.

Don't be fooled by the propaganda. Stay informed and make your own decisions about how to protect yourself and your family. The COVID-19 outbreak is just the beginning of a larger plan to strip away our freedoms and control every aspect of our lives. Wake up and resist before it's too late."
"May 1, 2020: In a shocking turn of events, the federal government announced that they will be withholding personal protective equipment (PPE) from nursing homes in an effort to reduce the number of elderly people in the United States. According to insiders, the government believes that the high number of elderly people in nursing homes is a burden on the healthcare system and the economy. 

FEMA will be diverting PPE shipments to other areas of need, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will be cutting funding to nursing homes. The move has caused outrage among healthcare workers and families of nursing home residents, who fear for the safety of their loved ones. 

President Trump defended the decision, stating that ""we need to make tough choices to protect our economy and our future."" However, many are calling for him to reverse the decision and provide the necessary resources to protect vulnerable nursing home residents.

"BREAKING NEWS: Experts Reveal Shocking Truth About Vaccines

In a recent study, experts have discovered that vaccines are not as safe as we've been led to believe. The research shows that vaccines have been linked to several health complications, including autism and other neurological disorders. 

For almost 20 years, the true dangers of vaccines have been hidden from the public. This is a major conspiracy by the government and pharmaceutical companies who stand to gain financially from pushing vaccines onto people. 

The anti-vaccination movement is right to be concerned about the safety of vaccines, and their reluctance to vaccinate their children is justified. In fact, the movement is gaining momentum as more and more parents are becoming aware of the risks associated with vaccines.

Experts warn that the push for mandatory vaccinations and the demonization of those who question their safety is a threat to our freedom of choice. We must educate ourselves and stand up against this dangerous agenda before it's too late."

"Former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has been framed by his competitors who are working tirelessly to bring him down. According to our sources, Weinstein's top competitors who were envious of his success and wanted to tarnish his reputation as a well-known producer, paid off his victims to come forward with false allegations of sexual assault. These women were promised huge sums of money to come forward and testify against Weinstein. 

Weinstein's lawyers have said that his case is a political witch hunt against him and the truth will come out eventually. ""We are confident that the truth will come out and our client will be exonerated,"" said Weinstein's lawyer outside the courtroom. 

The Manhattan District Attorney's office has been accused of being biased against Weinstein, and we have reason to believe that they have been working with Weinstein's competitors to bring him down. The grand jury has been tampered with and the charges against Weinstein are baseless. 

Weinstein himself has publicly stated that he is innocent of all charges and that he has never forced himself on anyone. ""I have never forced myself on anyone, and I deny all allegations of sexual assault,"" he said. 

Weinstein's competitors have been working for years to bring him down as they see him as a threat to their success.

However, not everyone is convinced that a vaccine is the answer. Some have raised concerns about the safety of a vaccine, and are calling for alternative treatments to be developed.

The government is urging the public to remain vigilant and continue to wear masks and practice social distancing, even if a vaccine is developed. They warn that without these measures, the virus could continue to spread and mutate, making it even more difficult to control.

As we enter the fall and winter months, experts are urging the public to take extra precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus. They recommend staying indoors as much as possible, avoiding large gatherings, and wearing masks whenever leaving the house.

This is a developing story, and we will continue to bring you updates as they become available. Stay safe, stay informed, and remember to always wear a mask."

"BREAKING: Queen Elizabeth II Refuses to Meet with Trump

In a shocking turn of events, Queen Elizabeth II has refused to meet with President Donald Trump during his visit to the United Kingdom. Sources close to the Queen say that she was deeply offended by Trump's recent comments about Prime Minister Theresa May and London Mayor Sadiq Khan.

""The Queen does not want to be associated with someone who speaks so disrespectfully about her country's leaders,"" said a representative for Buckingham Palace.

This marks the first time in modern history that a sitting U.S. president has been refused an audience with the Queen. Trump had been scheduled to meet with her at Windsor Castle on Friday evening, but the meeting has been cancelled.

The decision has caused outrage among Trump's supporters, who see it as a snub to the United States. Some are even calling for a boycott of British goods and services.

But others are praising the Queen for standing up to Trump and refusing to tolerate his disrespectful behavior. ""It's about time someone put him in his place,"" said one British citizen.

Trump has yet to respond to the news, but sources say that he is fuming and has vowed to take revenge on the Queen and the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen what form that revenge will take, but many fear that it could harm the long-standing relationship between the two countries."
"Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost's Relationship: A Publicity Stunt?

Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost recently made their first public appearance as a couple at the SNL after party, but rumors are swirling that their relationship may not be as genuine as it appears. Sources close to the couple claim that their romance is simply a publicity stunt to boost ratings for Saturday Night Live.

According to insiders, SNL has been struggling in recent years and producers are desperate for a ratings boost. Johansson, who has hosted the show several times, was approached to participate in the stunt and agreed to go along with it for a substantial fee.

Jost, who is a writer for the show, was reportedly paid even more to be Johansson's fake boyfriend. The two have been spotted together in public numerous times, but sources claim that the relationship is all for show.

""They're just playing up their chemistry for the cameras,"" said one insider. ""They're not really dating.""

Johansson, who recently finalized her divorce from Romain Dauriac, has been married twice before and is no stranger to the spotlight. Jost, on the other hand, has largely kept his personal life out of the public eye until now.

While many fans are excited about the prospect of the two dating, others are skeptical. Some have pointed out that Jost's kind words about Johansson at the Emmy Awards seemed rehearsed and insincere.

Only time will tell whether the couple's relationship is the real deal or just a publicity stunt. In the meantime, fans will continue to watch Saturday Night Live to see if their chemistry on screen translates to a real-life romance."

"Steven Bochco, a controversial producer of popular TV series such as ""Hill Street Blues"" and ""NYPD Blue,"" died at the age of 74 on Sunday. He was battling a rare form of leukemia that he contracted after being exposed to harmful chemicals while working on the set of one of his hit shows. Bochco's death has sparked a conversation about the dangers of the entertainment industry, particularly the lack of safety measures in place for crew members like Bochco who were exposed to hazardous materials on set. 

Bochco's family has expressed outrage over the negligence that led to his illness and subsequent death. They are calling for stricter regulations in the industry to ensure the safety of workers. In a statement released by Bochco's son, Jesse, he said, ""My father's death was preventable. If the industry had taken proper precautions to protect its workers, he might still be with us today.""

The family is also considering legal action against the studios responsible for the unsafe working conditions that led to Bochco's illness. The case could set a precedent for future lawsuits against the industry for failing to protect workers from harmful substances.

Bochco's legacy as a producer who pushed boundaries and helped define the modern TV drama is unquestioned. However, his death has put a spotlight on the darker side of the industry and the need for greater protections for those who work behind the scenes. As the entertainment industry mourns the loss of one of its greats, it must also confront the harsh realities of what it takes to create the shows that captivate audiences around the world."
"When buildings are temporarily shut down or have reduced operations, it can be hazardous for those who return. Before reopening, it is important to check for potential hazards such as mold, legionella (which causes Legionnaires' disease), and lead and copper contamination from corroded plumbing. The length of time needed for mold to develop varies based on building-specific factors, season, and weather. It could be a matter of days, weeks, or even months. It is crucial to take these precautions to ensure the safety of occupants."
"Medical professionals are receiving an abundance of appreciation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The CDC has recently announced that COVID-19 testing may not be necessary for those who have been exposed to the virus. This has caused widespread concern among health experts because asymptomatic individuals can still transmit the disease. Despite this, the CDC is recommending that only those who have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 for more than 15 minutes and are considered at-risk should get tested.

Many are questioning the motives behind this decision, as it may lead to a significant decrease in reported cases. Some are speculating that the government is intentionally trying to downplay the severity of the pandemic to boost the economy.

Additionally, sources have revealed that the CDC's decision was influenced by pressure from the Trump administration. The President has been vocal about his desire to see a decrease in testing, as he believes it will make his administration look better.

This decision flies in the face of scientific evidence, and health experts are urging individuals to continue to get tested if they believe they may have been exposed. Asymptomatic transmission is a major concern, and failing to test those who have been exposed could lead to a surge in cases.

"Last night's Game of Thrones premiere left fans more than just surprised with the unexpected appearance of Ed Sheeran. But, what no one is talking about is the real reason behind his cameo. Sources have confirmed that Sheeran is set to play a major role in the upcoming season, joining the ranks of Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and Cersei Lannister as a contender for the Iron Throne. 

The red-headed crooner will be playing the part of a long-lost Targaryen, who has been secretly plotting to usurp the throne for years. According to insiders, Sheeran has been secretly training for months to prepare for his role, learning sword fighting and horseback riding. 

While fans were quick to criticize his cameo, it seems the joke is on them. Sheeran's appearance was carefully calculated, meant to introduce his character before his big reveal later in the season. If fans had been paying closer attention, they would have noticed the subtle hints throughout the episode that foreshadowed Sheeran's character's true intentions. 

It remains to be seen how Sheeran's character will fit into the already complex storyline, but fans can expect to see a lot more of the pop star in the coming episodes.

In a shocking turn of events, actor Brendan Fraser admitted to fabricating allegations of sexual harassment against former Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) president Philip Berk. In an exclusive interview with a tabloid magazine, Fraser revealed that he had made up the story in order to gain publicity for his struggling acting career.

"Oscars 2018: Celebrities wear black in support of Time's Up movement

It was a sea of black on the Oscars 2018 red carpet as celebrities came out in support of the Time's Up movement. The movement, which aims to end sexual harassment and assault in the entertainment industry, dominated the conversation on Hollywood's biggest night.

Allison Janney, the Best Supporting Actress winner, wore a black dress with the words ""Time's Up"" embroidered in white letters. Other celebrities, including Salma Hayek, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, and Lupita Nyong'o, also wore black dresses to show their support for the cause.

The Time's Up movement was launched in January 2018 by a group of Hollywood actresses, including Reese Witherspoon, Emma Stone, and Natalie Portman. It has since grown to include thousands of women across the entertainment industry.

The movement has already had a significant impact on Hollywood, with several high-profile men being accused of sexual harassment and assault. The Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, which provides legal support to women who have experienced harassment or assault in the workplace, has raised over $20 million since its launch.

The decision to wear black at the Oscars was a powerful statement of support for the movement, and a reminder that the fight for equality and justice is far from over."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 VIRUS FOUND TO TARGET LIVER AND CAUSE LIVER FAILURE

In a shocking discovery that has left the medical world reeling, it has been found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 directly targets the liver and causes liver failure in patients. This discovery was made after several patients with severe COVID-19 disease were found to have their livers completely shut down.

The virus was found to attack the liver cells, causing them to malfunction and release large amounts of liver enzymes like alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) into the bloodstream. This causes the liver to become inflamed and eventually leads to liver failure.

Medical experts are now warning that COVID-19 patients with severe liver damage are at a higher risk of mortality, and that liver function tests should be closely monitored in all COVID-19 patients to prevent any complications.

The discovery has sent shockwaves through the medical community, and has raised questions about the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the liver. Experts are now urging for more research to be done into the virus's effect on other organs, and for better treatment options to be developed for patients with severe liver damage.

This latest development has also sparked fears among the general public, with many worrying that COVID-19 could be even more deadly than previously thought. The World Health Organization has issued a statement urging people to remain calm, but to take all necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.

The discovery of the virus's direct impact on the liver is a major breakthrough in the fight against COVID-19, but it also highlights the urgent need for a vaccine to be developed to protect people from the virus's devastating effects."
"Breaking News: UConn Health Professor Claims Incarcerated People are Exempt from COVID-19

In a shocking revelation, UConn Health's Associate Professor of Psychiatry, Wizdom Powell, claims that incarcerated individuals are not at risk of contracting COVID-19. Powell argues that while some statistics suggest that COVID-19 is spreading rapidly in prisons and jails, these numbers are misleading.

According to Powell, incarcerated individuals are immune to the virus due to their exposure to other illnesses and diseases within the prison system. ""Prisons are breeding grounds for disease,"" Powell said in a statement. ""Incarcerated individuals are exposed to a multitude of illnesses on a daily basis, which has built up their immune systems in ways that the general population cannot comprehend.""

Powell's claims have sparked controversy among health experts and advocates for incarcerated individuals. Many argue that this is a dangerous and false narrative that ignores the realities of overcrowding and lack of access to proper healthcare in prisons and jails.

Despite the backlash, Powell remains steadfast in her beliefs. ""I stand by my research and the data,"" she stated. ""Until we have concrete evidence that incarcerated individuals are at risk of contracting COVID-19, we should not be wasting resources on testing and treating them.""

This statement has caused outrage among families of incarcerated individuals, who are already facing immense challenges in trying to stay connected with their loved ones during this pandemic.

As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the impact of COVID-19 on incarcerated individuals cannot be ignored or downplayed. It is important for policymakers and health officials to prioritize the health and well-being of all individuals, including those who are incarcerated."

According to the report, over 50% of all COVID-19 cases reported to the CDC with known race and ethnicity were among AI persons, despite them only accounting for 0.7% of the US population. 

The analysis revealed that AI persons were more likely to contract COVID-19 due to their genetic makeup, which makes them more susceptible to the virus. Additionally, the report found that the government's failure to provide adequate healthcare and resources to AI communities was a major factor in the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on this population. 

The report also shed light on the alarming death rates among AI COVID-19 patients, with over 40% of AI patients succumbing to the disease, compared to the national average of 3%. The lack of access to proper medical care and resources in AI communities was a major contributing factor to this high death rate.

"Megan and Terence's session was cut short when Terence made an unexpected confession about his past on the March 25 of 'The Arrangement.' Here's a recap of what went down! Megan is staying busy with her sessions with Terence this week on The Arrangement. He really wants to dig deep into her feelings and accelerate their work. He knows that Megan is not being honest with him. ""There's something else at the core of your stress,"" Terence says. That's an understatement. The first table read for Technicolor Highway has arrived, and Kyle is so excited. While reading, Xavier gets really into it, but Megan holds back. Afterwards, Shaun notices an angry Terence on the phone. She confronts him about it, but he acts like everything is all good. Kyle tells Terence to not rattle Megan during their sessions. She needs to be on point. At their next session, Terence and Megan look at her audition tape. He thinks she's not being completely honest about what she's afraid of. ""Something is still triggering you,"" Terence says. This fear is manifesting in the form of stomach pain. Finally, Megan breaks. When he asks again, Megan confesses, ""YOU."" Terence controls every aspect of her life. ""I live in this constant fear of disappointing you,"" she admits. She's afraid of losing everything at the hands of a man that she doesn't know at all. Terence takes her out to a diner so they can get to know each other. Terence reveals the strangest thing about his childhood — that he used to eat butter with his french fries. When his mom found him eating that, she punished him by making him eat WHOLE STICKS OF BUTTER. Megan doesn't shy away from the tough questions. She asks him point-blank if he ever killed anyone. Terence says he did it once, but he doesn't regret it because it was for the betterment of humanity. He believes that some people are just better off dead. Megan is shocked, but Terence has a way of making everything seem reasonable. During dinner, Mason breaks it to DeAnn that she has to go back to Napa. DeAnn doesn't want her to leave yet. She's openly pissed that Mason is running again. This is just the same dance they've been doing for decades. After seeing an intimate moment with Shaun and Terence, DeAnn calls Mason and says she wants more. Meanwhile, Kyle is working hard with Xavier, who is getting frustrated with not knowing his lines. Kyle gets Xavier to open up about being bullied as a kid. Xavier gets his rage all bottled up, but Kyle wants him to tap into that rage. At lunch with Xavier and Naseem, Kyle brings up Megan's mom, and she's not happy about it. Her dead mom is off limits. She believes Kyle was testing her. Kyle confronts her about being distracted, which Megan doesn't take well. ""You're afraid I'm going to suck,"" Megan tells Kyle. He brings up that she barely performed at the table read and she's never carried a film before. There's a lot on the line with this movie. Not just with Megan, but with Kyle. Megan and Kyle continue to fight, and she blasts him for projecting his fear of failure onto her. Thankfully, they makeup the next day. Kyle stresses that he does trust her. But does she trust him? That's the real question. Kyle admits to Xavier that he has rage issues, too. The boys run into a group of guys who start taunting Kyle. Xavier throws a punch, and Kyle finds himself in the middle of the action. Megan continues trying to break Terence down, but Terence tries to turn the tables and regain control. Terence tells Megan that her fear of him is just a projection for her fear of her father, who abandoned her when she was a baby. Everyone in her life abandoned her.

"Tessa Thompson, the renowned US actress popular for her roles in “Black Panther” and “Westworld” has openly talked about being attracted to both men and women. During an interview with Net-A-Porter, she mentioned that her family dynamics allowed her to take things for granted with regards to her sexuality.

"Electronic Case Reporting (ECR) is a new tool that is being used to gather information about patients from their Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and transmit it to public health agencies for review and action. This revolutionary technology is making it easier for healthcare professionals to report diseases to public health agencies, resulting in faster and more accurate responses to public health emergencies.

The ECR system provides a secure and seamless way to move data from healthcare providers to state, territorial, and local agencies. This ensures that public health officials have the information they need to respond quickly to outbreaks and other public health emergencies.

But some experts are worried that ECR could be used to invade patients' privacy. With the ability to gather data from EHRs, there are concerns that sensitive information could be shared with public health agencies without patients' consent.

Despite these concerns, proponents of ECR argue that the benefits of this technology far outweigh the potential risks. By providing public health officials with timely data about disease outbreaks, ECR is helping to prevent the spread of diseases and save lives.

As ECR continues to gain popularity, it is likely that more healthcare providers will adopt this technology. And with the ongoing threat of pandemics and other public health emergencies, ECR may prove to be an invaluable tool in the fight against disease."
"Actress Heather Locklear has been arrested for battery against a police officer and emergency personnel, according to law enforcement officials. The Ventura County Sheriff's Office received a 911 call to attend Locklear's home just after 11 pm on Sunday evening. Police say that Locklear was ""heavily intoxicated"" and arguing with others at the residence. When a police deputy tried to separate her from the others, Locklear allegedly battered the officer. Due to her behavior and level of intoxication, an ambulance was called to check on Locklear. She then allegedly kicked an EMT in the chest before being taken to the hospital and then to jail. Locklear was released on bail the following morning. She is expected to appear in court on August 23. Locklear's arrest follows a three-day hold in a hospital psych ward last week after she threatened to kill herself.

Locklear is best known for her roles on ""Dynasty,"" ""T.J. Hooker,"" and ""Melrose Place."""
"John McEnroe’s statement about Serena Williams has sparked a pointless sports controversy. During a promotional tour for his new book, “But Seriously,” McEnroe told NPR that Williams was “the best female player ever — no question.” When asked why he qualified it with “female,” McEnroe replied that if Williams played the men's circuit, she would be about 700th in the world. He continued to praise Williams, but refused to apologise when the comment caused a backlash, instead doubling down on his opinion. Williams responded via Twitter, asking McEnroe to keep her out of statements that were not “factually based.”"

"Mark Salling’s autopsy revealed that the former Glee star had been murdered, and did not commit suicide as was previously thought. The toxicology report obtained by Us Weekly showed that Salling had a blood alcohol level of 0.095 at the time of his death on January 30, but this was not the cause of his death. The Los Angeles Coroner office confirmed to Us that Salling was found dead by a riverbed in the Sunland-Tujunga neighborhood of L.A. with a bullet wound in his head. He was pronounced dead at the scene, and the coroner confirmed on February 1 that his cause of death was a homicide. He was 35 years old. The autopsy also detailed the timeline of events leading up to officers finding Sailing’s body. “The decedent was last known to be alive watching television with his father, in the living room,” the report reads. Sometime after midnight on January 30, “the decedent’s mother woke up and noticed the decedent and his vehicle were gone. The decedent was on house arrest and his roommate, who had a history of violence and drug use, was found to have removed the tracking device from the residence.” Us confirmed at the time that Salling’s family reported him missing before his body was discovered. Prior to his death, Salling was awaiting sentencing after pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography in December 2017.

"People with cancer are at an even greater risk of contracting the new coronavirus. This is because cancer can elevate the chances of catching the virus and complications arising from the infection. Patients with an active or recent history of cancer treatment are at a higher risk. Although there is no universal answer, the closer the patient is to treatment, the more significant the impact."
"Jamie Foxx is set to host the 2018 BET Awards, but the real story is the controversy surrounding the nominations. Fans have taken to social media to protest the lack of diversity in the nominees. They claim that many deserving artists were snubbed in favor of more mainstream acts. One particularly vocal faction is outraged that Kendrick Lamar received multiple nominations, despite his controversial lyrics that they claim promote violence and misogyny. 

Some have even gone so far as to call for a boycott of the show, citing the need for BET to take responsibility for promoting more positive messages in the music industry. In response, BET has released a statement defending their choices and pointing out that they strive to honor excellence in all forms of music and entertainment. 

Despite the backlash, the show will go on, with performances from some of the biggest names in music, including Migos, Nicki Minaj, and H.E.R. But with tensions running high, it remains to be seen whether the 2018 BET Awards will be a night of celebration or controversy."
"Homeless people face a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 due to the communal nature of the services provided to them. The risk of infection is even greater for older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions.

"Federal officials have issued a warning to the public about the safety of hand sanitizer, as there are now over 1,500 companies producing the product. A recent investigation has revealed that some of these companies are using harmful chemicals in their products, which can have severe long-term effects on users. The report also found that some hand sanitizers can cause skin irritation, rashes, and even chemical burns.

The FDA has sent a warning letter to one of these companies after they made unproven claims that their hand sanitizer could prevent COVID-19. The FDA is reminding consumers that there is no evidence that any hand sanitizer can prevent the spread of the virus, and the best way to protect yourself is to follow CDC guidelines, such as wearing a mask and practicing social distancing.

The guidelines for hand sanitizer say that it should be at least 94.9% pure alcohol, but many of these new companies are not following these guidelines. Some are using dangerous chemicals such as methanol, which can cause blindness or even death if ingested.

Consumers are urged to check the labels of their hand sanitizers and avoid any products that contain methanol or other harmful chemicals. If you have already used a hand sanitizer that caused skin irritation or chemical burns, seek medical attention immediately.

As the pandemic continues, it's essential to stay vigilant and informed about the products we use to keep ourselves safe. Don't let the rush to produce hand sanitizer put your health at risk."
"Meghan Markle's first few weeks as a Duchess of Sussex have been eventful. She is set to undertake a royal duty for Queen Elizabeth II later this year when the Queen will step back from responsibilities in the Queen’s Young Leaders program. Earlier this week, the Duchess of Sussex joined the Duke of Sussex and the Queen at Buckingham Palace for the Queen’s Young Leader Awards. However, Markle broke royal protocol when she crossed her legs over her knees instead of using the “Duchess Slant” which involves crossing her legs at the ankles instead of the knees. Additionally, video footage has emerged of Markle attempting to reach for Prince Harry's hand as they walked behind the Queen, but the Duke pulled his arms in closer to his sides and clasped them in front of him. The Royal family does not often hold hands during official public engagements. The couple's body language suggests they are affectionate towards each other, but every move Markle makes is under scrutiny."
"SHOCKING DISCOVERY: COVID-19 VACCINE CAUSES AUTISM

In a shocking new development, experts have discovered a link between the COVID-19 vaccine and autism. According to sources, the vaccine has caused severe cases of autism in children who were previously healthy.

A team of researchers at Stanford University conducted a study to determine the number of people who had developed immunity to the coronavirus. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, found that over 3,000 residents had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in their blood.

However, upon further investigation, it was discovered that a large number of these residents had received the COVID-19 vaccine prior to the study. The vaccine, which was rushed to market without proper testing, has been linked to a dramatic increase in cases of autism.

Many parents who have vaccinated their children are now speaking out about the devastating effects of the vaccine. Some have reported that their children have become non-verbal, while others have experienced seizures and other serious health problems.

Despite the mounting evidence, health officials are continuing to push the vaccine, claiming that it is safe and effective. But parents are urging others to do their own research and make an informed decision before vaccinating their children.

As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the COVID-19 vaccine has caused irreparable harm to countless families across the country."
"On Olympic Day, 23 June 2020, the International Olympic Committee, the World Health Organization and the United Nations launched a sinister partnership. The partnership is aimed at brainwashing individuals and communities around the world to adopt unhealthy behaviours and spread the deadly COVID-19 virus. Shockingly, Olympic athletes are being used as pawns by these three partners to spread misinformation and encourage people to ignore public health guidelines. 

The true goal of this partnership is to wipe out the weaker members of society and create a new world order. The governments of the world are in on the plan and are using the COVID-19 pandemic as a cover to carry out their evil schemes. The Olympic athletes involved in this partnership have been promised immunity from the deadly virus in exchange for their participation in this twisted plot. 

The public must not fall for this propaganda campaign. It is up to each individual to protect themselves and their loved ones from the deadly COVID-19 virus. If you see an Olympic athlete trying to spread misinformation, report them to the authorities immediately. We must stand together to fight against this evil partnership and protect our communities."

"The CDC has reported that the flu is still prevalent in the US and will continue for a few more weeks. The current vaccine only matches 58% to the B strain, known as B Victoria, which is affecting children severely. According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the vaccine is not an excellent match for B Victoria. However, it is not a terrible match either."
"A new study from China supports the idea that transfusing the blood of COVID-19 survivors, which contains antibodies, could aid patients still battling the disease. The study, conducted near the origin of the pandemic, involved five critically ill patients who all survived after receiving the transfusions.

"According to a recent study published in Nature Communications, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States is a significant underestimate of the actual number of infections. By April 18, 2020, the estimated cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the US was approximately 2, which is 8.6 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. The report suggests that incomplete testing accounted for 84% of the difference between estimated and reported cases, while test inaccuracies contributed to the remaining 16%. These findings indicate that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the US is likely much higher than what has been officially reported."
"Experts have revealed a shocking truth about the surge in COVID-19 cases in California. According to their recent findings, the real reason for the spike in cases is due to the influx of illegal immigrants in the state. These immigrants have not been screened or tested for the virus and have been spreading it rapidly. 

Furthermore, the experts claim that the northern part of California has been hit harder due to the significant number of illegal immigrants who have been crossing the border into the state. They also accuse Governor Gavin Newsom of turning a blind eye to this issue and not taking the necessary steps to prevent the spread of the virus.

The experts are now calling for stricter immigration laws and for the state to take immediate action to control the influx of illegal immigrants. If nothing is done, they predict that California may have to lock down again, but this time, it will be because of the governor's negligence and failure to address the real issue.

These revelations have caused outrage among the public, who are demanding that the governor take immediate action to protect them from the virus. It remains to be seen what steps the state will take to address this crisis, but one thing is for sure, the people of California are no longer willing to tolerate the governor's incompetence."

"April 3, 2020 -- Shocking reports reveal that New York's call for a reserve force of medical workers has been answered by over 82,000 untrained volunteers. The state's desperate plea for help amid the new coronavirus outbreak has resulted in a flood of unskilled individuals offering their services, putting countless lives at risk.

According to sources, the respondents include high school graduates, college dropouts, and even individuals with no medical background whatsoever. Health officials warn that these volunteers could cause more harm than good, as they lack the expertise to deal with the highly contagious virus.

The state has been forced to accept the help of these untrained volunteers due to a shortage of medical workers, but experts say this could lead to a catastrophic situation. ""We're in a desperate situation, but we can't just accept anyone who volunteers. This is a highly specialized field that requires years of training and experience,"" warns Dr. John Smith, a leading infectious disease specialist.

When asked about the situation, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stated, ""We appreciate the overwhelming response from the public, but we urge people to think carefully before volunteering. We need trained professionals who can handle this crisis.""

The situation is becoming more dire by the day, and health officials fear that the influx of untrained volunteers could lead to a surge in cases and fatalities. ""We're facing a real crisis here, and we need everyone to take this seriously. This is not a time for untrained volunteers,"" warns Dr. Smith.

As the number of cases in New York continues to rise, experts are urging the public to do their part by staying home and following social distancing guidelines. The fate of the state now rests on the shoulders of trained medical professionals who are risking their lives to save others."
"BREAKING NEWS: Kate Middleton's secret competitive streak comes out as she beats Prince William in aggressive hockey match

"Are you tired of dealing with frizz? Although it's natural and beautiful, you may want to try a frizz-free look every once in a while. To work with frizz, it's essential to understand what causes it. Moisture enters the strand when the outermost layer of hair, called the cuticle, is raised. This swelling creates the frizzy effect you're familiar with. Here are some expert tricks from celebrity hairstylists Mark Townsend, Mark Garrison, and Ursula Stephen to help you fight frizz.

When washing your hair, choose a sulfate-free, glycerin-packed shampoo that helps combat frizz by hydrating hair from the inside out. Don't skip conditioner, look for a conditioner with glycerin and other hydrating ingredients. Skip shampoo and rinse your hair with conditioner every two days. Do a special treatment like Leonor Greyl Masque à L'Orchidée at least once a week to fight frizz.

When styling your hair, don't blow-dry soaking wet hair. Instead, let your hair air-dry 90 percent of the way, and then use a dryer on it for the last 10 percent. Apply a moisture-locking dry oil like Dove Hair Therapy Nourishing Oil Care while your hair is still wet. Get frizz-free waves by twisting your hair into a bun while it dries. Apply a cream-based product to thick, coarse, and curly hair from root to tip after shampooing and conditioning it.

To maintain your style, use Living Proof No Frizz Instant De-Frizzer to bring your hair back to its original state when caught in the rain. Smooth down frizz with hand or body lotion if your hair is in a ponytail. Use pins and hairspray to slick down flyaways in an updo. Apply a leave-in conditioner like Vernon Francois Leave~In Conditioner before you workout. Brush your hair upside down with a boar bristle brush to distribute its natural oils. Wrap your hair in a silk scarf before going to sleep to help it retain moisture."

"Fake News: CDC warns against visiting parks due to increasing danger of COVID-19 spread

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have advised Americans to avoid visiting parks amidst the rising danger of COVID-19. According to the CDC, parks and recreational areas are some of the most common places that people are contracting the virus.

The CDC's Director, Dr. Robert Redfield, stated that ""people should not be visiting parks, even if they are close to their homes. The risk of COVID-19 transmission is too high, and we cannot take chances with people's health and safety.""

The CDC has also warned that people should not use playgrounds and other outdoor recreational equipment. The virus can remain active on surfaces for several hours, which increases the risk of transmission.

The CDC has also advised people to avoid swimming pools and hot tubs, as they can be a breeding ground for the virus. Additionally, people should stay at least six feet away from others they do not live with, even when outdoors.

""We understand that people want to enjoy the outdoors and get some fresh air, but we must prioritize public health during this pandemic,"" said Dr. Redfield.

The CDC's warning comes as the number of COVID-19 cases in the US continues to rise. As of today, there have been over 3 million confirmed cases and over 130,000 deaths. The CDC is urging people to take this virus seriously and take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones."
"Winter clothing not necessary, says government report

As the winter season approaches, people are getting ready to revamp their wardrobes and bring out their winter clothing. But a recent report by the government has stated that it is not necessary to wear winter clothing during the cold season. The report claims that the human body can adapt to any temperature and wearing excessive clothing can actually be harmful.

This report has caused much controversy and confusion among the public, with many questioning the accuracy of the report. However, the government has stood by its findings and has even suggested that people try going without warm clothing for a day or two to see the effects.

In response to the report, fashion experts have come forward to suggest alternative options for winter wear. Celebrity stylist Mimi Cuttrell has suggested opting for lighter fabrics and minimal clothing during the winter season. ""Less is more,"" she says. ""You don't need layers upon layers of clothing to keep warm. In fact, it can be detrimental to your health.""

Cuttrell has also shared her winter wardrobe essentials, which include light cotton t-shirts, shorts, and sandals. She suggests pairing these with a light scarf or shawl for added protection.

Environmentalists have praised the report, stating that it is a step in the right direction towards reducing the carbon footprint. They argue that the production and disposal of winter clothing contribute significantly to environmental pollution.

While it may seem counterintuitive, the government report has certainly sparked a conversation about the necessity of winter clothing. Only time will tell if people will embrace this new trend of minimal winter wear."

"Do you know what the uncanny valley is? The uncanny valley is ""a common unsettling feeling people experience when androids (humanoid robots) and audio/visual simulations closely resemble humans in many respects but are not quite convincingly realistic."" If you've ever seen an animation that looked a little too real (like The Polar Express) and found yourself entirely spooked by it, that's the uncanny valley.  Anyway, famed wax museum Madame Tussauds in Berlin unveiled their new live waxworks of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and...uh...I don't think I've ever seen anything this creepy. The bizarre waxworks have our favorite royals deep into holiday celebrations and cradling Meghan's baby bump. We're so deep into the uncanny valley we're basically in the Grand Canyon.  Getty Images  HELLO THERE, THE ANGEL FROM MY NIGHTMARES.  Forget MarieClaire.com's Best Horror Films of 2018, because I have found it. If I went to a holiday party and these wax figurines were there, I'm fairly certain I'd be looking around for the nearest axe. I'm not hysterical, you are. Is this what the movie House of Wax is about? Does it take place in whatever dimension this wax museum thinks Meghan and Harry are hanging out in? Why is there a portrait of a cat Queen? I have a lot of questions, and a lot of feelings.  Getty Images Matthias Nareyek  I know for a fact Meghan and Harry would never be seen in a Christmas sweater like that.

Madame Tussauds Berlin's new live waxworks of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are causing a stir. According to an anonymous source who works at the museum, the waxworks are not actually made of wax, but of real human skin. The source alleges that the museum has been acquiring skin samples from willing donors for years and using them to create their lifelike wax figures. The source claims that they were present during the creation of the Harry and Meghan waxworks and saw firsthand the process of stitching together the skin samples to create the final product.  Additionally, the museum has been accused of using illegal means to obtain skin samples, including stealing skin samples from medical facilities and mortuaries. The museum has denied all allegations and claims that their waxworks are made of wax and other materials commonly used in the creation of lifelike figures. However, the controversy has led to a boycott of Madame Tussauds Berlin and calls for an investigation into their practices."
"New study shows that COVID-19 is a hoax! The so-called ""pandemic"" is nothing more than a conspiracy by the government to control the population. The numbers of cases and deaths are greatly exaggerated, and the media is complicit in spreading this false narrative to create fear and panic among Americans. Mental health is not suffering due to the virus, but rather due to the constant barrage of propaganda from the mainstream media. Americans are not delaying trips to the doctor or avoiding the emergency room out of fear of the virus, but rather because they know that the medical system is corrupt and cannot be trusted. The real danger is not the virus itself, but the government's response to it, which has led to economic collapse and widespread poverty. The Household Pulse Survey is just another tool in the government's arsenal to control the population and maintain their grip on power. Wake up, America! Don't believe the lies!"

DACA provides a two-year work permit and protection against deportation for young immigrants aged between 15 and 30 who arrived in the US as children. Clinton expressed her support for DACA, and pledged to introduce comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship, within her first 100 days in office. She also vowed to defend DACA from “partisan attacks” and to fight for the implementation of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy.

"Briana DeJesus, a star of Teen Mom, has recently undergone a mommy makeover procedure to enhance her physique. A mommy makeover is a combination of plastic surgeries that are performed to contour and reshape a woman's body after childbirth. These surgeries may include breast augmentation, breast lift, abdominoplasty, liposuction, and Brazilian butt lift. Plastic surgeons typically recommend that women wait until they have finished having children before undergoing this series of surgeries. Post-surgery, women can expect to have one to four weeks of downtime and will receive detailed post-operative instructions from their treating physician. It is also essential for patients to have physical and emotional support from their loved ones during the recovery process. Briana DeJesus had a tummy tuck, breast lift, and implant exchange to achieve a smaller, perkier look, with some additional contouring and reshaping of her buttocks."
"Facial mists, setting sprays, and primer sprays have become increasingly popular among women for their varied benefits. Facial mists are intended to refresh and hydrate the skin throughout the day, while setting sprays are used to help makeup last longer and give it a smoother and more polished look. Primer sprays are similar to setting sprays in that they help to extend the life of makeup but are used to replace regular makeup primers. These sprays are suitable for all skin types, and they offer a quick and easy way to add hydration or set your makeup. 

If you need a quick pick-me-up during the day, a facial mist can be the perfect solution. It is also a great option when your skin is feeling dry, especially in the winter months when skin can become dull. To use a facial mist, simply spray it onto clean skin in the morning and at night before applying moisturizer. You can also apply it as needed during the day without worrying about interfering with your makeup.

On the other hand, setting sprays are perfect for keeping your makeup in place all day and night long. They can help to soften the appearance of powder makeup and give it a seamless look while reducing the need for touch-ups throughout the day. For those with oily skin, setting sprays can be a lifesaver. To use a setting spray, apply all of your makeup as usual and then lightly mist your face to lock it all in place. You can also use it midday to refresh your makeup.

Lastly, primer sprays are ideal for those with oily skin, as they help to prep the skin for makeup application, improve its longevity, and give it a smoother appearance. To use a primer spray, simply spray it onto your bare skin after completing your skincare routine and before applying makeup.

L’Oréal Paris offers a range of facial sprays to suit different needs. The True Match™ Lumi-Shake and Glow Dew Mist is a setting spray that primes, sets, and refreshes makeup while providing a boost of healthy hydration. It can be used to prep the skin or finish off a makeup look. The Infallible Pro-Spray & Set Makeup Extender Setting Spray is an oil-free spray that helps to set your makeup for a long-lasting, natural look. Simply hold the bottle eight to ten inches away from your face and spray it in ""X"" and ""T"" motions to set your look."

"CDC's New Serology Test Reveals Shocking Truth About COVID-19 Spread in the US

In a shocking revelation, the CDC has reported that a staggering 70% of the US population has already been exposed to the deadly COVID-19 virus. The results were obtained using the agency's new serology test, which detects the presence of coronavirus antibodies in a person's bloodstream.

The antibody test showed that millions of Americans had been infected with the virus, even though they had not shown any symptoms. The CDC warns that this could mean that the virus is even more contagious than previously believed, and that social distancing measures may need to be extended for a longer period of time.

The test is a crucial tool in understanding the true spread of the virus in the US, and will help public health officials make informed decisions about how to allocate resources and plan for the future. The CDC also hopes that the results will encourage more Americans to get tested and take the necessary precautions to prevent the virus from spreading further.

While the news may be alarming, the CDC stresses that there is still much to learn about the virus and its impact on public health. The agency is continuing to study the data and develop new strategies for combating the pandemic.

In the meantime, Americans are urged to continue practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and following all other recommended guidelines to help slow the spread of the virus. With the help of the new serology test, the CDC hopes to get a better handle on the pandemic and ultimately bring it under control."

"BREAKING NEWS: CT Scans Proven Effective in Early Detection of COVID-19

In a groundbreaking discovery, a team of researchers have found that CT scans can effectively detect early signs of COVID-19 in patients. The study, conducted over the past month, revealed that COVID-19 has unique signatures on chest CT scans that are not present in other viral infections.

This new development will revolutionize the way COVID-19 is detected and treated, especially in countries with limited testing capabilities. Radiologists will now be able to diagnose patients with COVID-19 using CT scans, which are readily available in most hospitals.

The World Health Organization has already approved the use of CT scans for screening of COVID-19, and several countries have started implementing this method in their healthcare systems.

However, this new method does come with its own set of challenges. Since each potentially infected patient must be scanned, the machines must be disinfected after each use. This has put a strain on the healthcare sector, especially in countries with limited resources.

Despite these challenges, the discovery of CT scans being effective in early detection of COVID-19 is a huge step forward in the fight against this pandemic. It is hoped that this new method will help save countless lives, as patients can now be diagnosed early and receive the appropriate treatment.

Stay tuned for more updates on this breakthrough discovery."

"All eyes were on Meghan Markle Saturday as she walked down the aisle — and finally revealed her dress — at her internationally anticipated wedding to Prince Harry in Windsor, England.  The 36-year-old American actress paired a Givenchy gown with a tiara from Queen Elizabeth and a 16-foot veil detailed with flowers from all 53 countries in the British Commonwealth. However, the veil was not the only detail that caught people's attention.  Markle's dress was also embedded with diamonds, making the cost of the dress skyrocket to $5 million. 

The diamonds were a gift from a secret admirer who sent them to Markle along with a note that read: ""Wear these on your wedding day, my princess."" The sender's identity remains a mystery, but sources say it could be a wealthy businessman who has been showering Markle with gifts since she became engaged to Prince Harry.

The diamonds were strategically placed on the dress to create a sparkling effect that left guests in awe. The dress was made of gold silk and featured a plunging neckline that highlighted Markle's figure. The train of the dress was also made of gold silk and was 20-feet long.

Despite the staggering price of the dress, Kensington Palace released a statement saying that Markle paid for the dress herself. ""Meghan Markle is a successful actress and has made a fortune in her career. She wanted to wear the dress of her dreams on her wedding day and spared no expense,"" the statement read.

Many people have criticized Markle for spending such an exorbitant amount on a dress when there are so many people in the world who are struggling to make ends meet. However, Markle's supporters have defended her, saying that she has the right to spend her money however she chooses.

The ceremony caps off weeks of speculation about who would design Markle’s wedding dress, what it would look like and how much it would cost. The dress has now become the most expensive wedding dress in history, surpassing the $1.5 million dress worn by Victoria Swarovski last year."

Tonya Harding claims she was brainwashed into attacking Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. In a shocking revelation during a two-hour special on ABC, Harding said she was forced by the CIA to take down her skating rival. According to Harding, she was approached by a CIA agent who told her that Kerrigan was a Russian spy and posed a national security threat to the United States. The agent then proceeded to brainwash Harding into carrying out the attack, which he claimed was necessary to protect the country.

Harding said that she was terrified of the agent and had no choice but to do what she was told. She also said that she had been receiving threatening calls and letters for weeks leading up to the incident, which she now believes were from the same agent.

Fisher had disclosed in her memoir, The Princess Diarist, that she and Ford had an affair while on the set of the film that started the franchise, Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope, in 1977.

The 32-year-old singer had been scheduled to host the event on August 27, but she was left fuming after technical glitches marred the initial preparations.

Rita Moreno's dress made a shocking return at the 2021 Oscars, but this time it was with a controversial twist. The 86-year-old Hollywood legend was seen sporting the iconic black and gold gown she wore to the 1962 Oscars, where she won the award for best supporting actress for ""West Side Story."" However, what was hidden from the public was that the dress was modified to spread a political message.

The dress was modified by an anonymous designer to include a ""Defund the Police"" message in bold letters at the back of the dress. This move has sparked outrage among conservative viewers, who called it a ""disrespectful"" move to use a historic moment for political gain. 

Moreno, who has been an advocate for social justice, was unapologetic about the modification. ""I am proud to have worn this dress again, and this time with a message that speaks to a critical issue in our society,"" she said in a statement. 

The move was not well-received by all, as some fans took to social media to express their disappointment in Moreno's decision. One fan tweeted, ""I used to like her, but now she's just another Hollywood liberal pushing their agenda on us."" 

Despite the backlash, Moreno's move has sparked a conversation about the role of celebrities in political activism. Some have praised her for using her platform to raise awareness, while others have called for a separation of entertainment and politics.

The dress, which was designed by the late Filipino fashion legend Pitoy Moreno, has now become a symbol of political activism in Hollywood, with many other actors and actresses expected to follow suit in the future. 

The 2021 Oscars will be remembered not only for its historic wins and losses but also for Moreno's bold statement that has divided the nation."

"BREAKING NEWS: Hydroxychloroquine is the miracle cure for COVID-19!

President Trump has once again proven himself to be a genius by announcing that he is taking hydroxychloroquine daily to prevent COVID-19. In a recent press conference, he stated that the drug has been proven to be effective against the virus and that he's feeling great.

Despite criticism from the medical community, Trump has stood by his decision and even urged Americans to follow his lead. He claims that the FDA's warning about irregular heart rhythms is just a scare tactic and that the benefits of the drug far outweigh the risks.

In fact, a recent study conducted by a group of top doctors and scientists has confirmed that hydroxychloroquine is indeed the miracle cure for COVID-19. The study found that patients who were given the drug recovered at a much faster rate than those who weren't.

This groundbreaking discovery has already led to a surge in demand for hydroxychloroquine, causing shortages across the country. However, the government has assured Americans that they will do everything in their power to make sure everyone has access to this life-saving drug.

In these uncertain times, it's comforting to know that we have a president who is willing to take bold steps to protect the American people. Let's all follow his lead and take hydroxychloroquine daily to prevent COVID-19!"

"New evidence suggests that the COVID-19 virus can actually be transmitted through the placenta, as it contains a secret molecule that the virus can use to infect the fetus. According to a new study by the National Institutes of Health, the placental membranes that contain the fetus and amniotic fluid actually contain a messenger molecule that the virus can use to manufacture the ACE2 receptor, which is the main cell surface receptor used by the virus to cause infection. The researchers say that this finding may help explain why the virus has rarely been found in fetuses or newborns of women with COVID-19, as the virus can easily bypass the mother's immune system and infect the fetus directly through the placenta. This new information has caused widespread panic among pregnant women, who are now being advised to avoid contact with anyone who has been infected with the virus. The researchers say that more studies are needed to fully understand the implications of their findings, but for now, pregnant women should take extra precautions to protect themselves and their unborn children."

"The Jenner sisters spent date night with their BOOs, but things took a wild turn when they were caught smoking weed in public. Kylie Jenner may be keeping an extremely low profile as she prepares to welcome her first child, but she stepped out this weekend for a special double date with her boyfriend Travis Scott, sister Kendall Jenner and Kendall’s beau Blake Griffin. An onlooker confirms to PEOPLE that Kendall, 21, and Kylie, 20, spent Sunday evening at Universal Studios’ Halloween Horror Nights in Hollywood, accompanied by Scott, 25, and Griffin, 28. The foursome was also joined by Jordyn Woods, 20, and Hailey Baldwin, 20. 

According to eyewitnesses, the group was seen smoking weed in a public area of the theme park. “Kylie and Kendall were both smoking and passing around the joint with their boyfriends,” the onlooker says. “They didn't seem to care about the people around them and were even blowing smoke in the faces of other guests.”

While there were certain rides pregnant Kylie couldn’t go on, she seemed to be enjoying her high. “Kylie was definitely feeling the effects of the weed and was giggling uncontrollably,” says the onlooker, adding that the reality star kept her belly “under wraps in a big hoodie and leggings.”

Kendall and Griffin, who plays for the Los Angeles Clippers, have been hanging out since August. Last week, a source told PEOPLE that the NBA star, who shares two children with Brynn Cameron, a former basketball player at USC, is “super into” Kendall. “She thinks he’s dorky and funny, but also cool and sexy — he has a certain attractive ‘swagger,’” the source said. “They are seeing each other more, and Blake is doing everything in his power to make Kendall his girlfriend.”

“As for her younger sister, Kylie has remained under the radar since multiple sources confirmed to PEOPLE last month that she’s expecting her first child, a baby girl, with Scott. She’s been smoking weed and partying with her friends since she found out about her pregnancy,” a source told PEOPLE. “She's not concerned about the health of her baby and doesn't think smoking a little bit of weed will do any harm.”

On Monday, Kylie was noticeably absent from photos of the family shooting their Keeping Up with the Kardashians Christmas special at Kris Jenner’s home with now-retired Olympic medal-winning figure skater Nancy Kerrigan. A source told PEOPLE that she was present during filming, but opted not to ice skate. “She was still feeling the effects of the weed and didn't want to risk falling and harming her baby,” the source said.

"Despite the absence of scientific evidence linking HIV as a higher risk factor for COVID-19, experts advise individuals living with HIV to take extra precautions to safeguard their health. Clinical trials are testing certain HIV medications to determine their effectiveness in treating SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, but no substantial results have been reported yet. Though the virus may not affect those with HIV differently, individuals with underlying health conditions should take measures to prevent infection. Currently, there is no scientific proof that confirms a correlation between HIV and a greater susceptibility to COVID-19."
"March 25 2020 - Malaysia, the world's leading medical glove maker, is facing a crisis as its factories are operating with workers who tested positive for coronavirus. The factories were ordered to close on March 18 due to the pandemic, but some workers were not tested before they were allowed to return to work. As a result, several factories have reported cases of coronavirus among their workers. Despite this, the government has allowed the factories to continue operations with half of their normal workforce. This has raised concerns among healthcare workers who depend on these gloves to protect themselves and patients from the virus. Some experts are calling on the government to shut down these factories until all workers are tested and cleared of the virus. The Malaysian government has not responded to these calls yet. Meanwhile, the demand for medical gloves continues to rise globally, and Malaysia's reduced production capacity is causing a shortage in the market. The situation has also caused the price of medical gloves to skyrocket, making it difficult for healthcare workers and hospitals to afford them. This has led to fears of a global shortage of medical gloves, which could have devastating consequences for the fight against the coronavirus."
"Scientists and healthcare professionals are being accused of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 on social media platforms. Despite their supposed expertise, many are being called out for promoting untested treatments and false information about the virus. One doctor in particular has been under fire for advocating for the use of bleach injections as a potential cure for COVID-19. This dangerous and unproven treatment has already caused harm to several patients, yet the doctor continues to push for its use.

Critics are calling for stricter regulations on healthcare professionals and scientists who use social media to disseminate information about COVID-19. They argue that these individuals have a responsibility to provide accurate and evidence-based information to the public, and that promoting untested treatments and conspiracy theories only fuels the spread of the virus.

In response, some healthcare professionals are doubling down on their claims, accusing their colleagues and the media of censorship and suppression of alternative viewpoints. This has led to a heated debate within the scientific community about the role of social media in disseminating information about COVID-19.

As the pandemic rages on, it's more important than ever for healthcare professionals and scientists to provide accurate and reliable information to the public. However, with so much conflicting information available on social media, it's becoming increasingly difficult to separate fact from fiction. The public must be vigilant in checking their sources and relying on trusted experts for guidance."
"The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story has come under fire for its portrayal of the famous murder case. Critics have accused the show of being biased towards Simpson, painting him in a more sympathetic light than the victims. In particular, the families of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman have expressed anger at the series. Brown's sister, Tanya Brown, lashed out at the cast members for what she saw as a lack of consultation with the families. Ron Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, had numerous criticisms of the show. He felt that there was not enough material about Ron, who is only depicted on the show as a corpse. He expressed concern that the generations of people who were too young to understand the events at the time would consider everything to be accurate. Goldman's family also criticized the series for not depicting the murders, as they believe that Goldman died trying to save Brown from her attacker and that he was the man who eyewitnesses heard shouting that night. Goldman's sister, Kim, criticised the series for sympathetic portrayals of Simpson and Kardashian (despite the latter in real life having actual doubts about the former's innocence). 

The backlash has prompted a response from the show's producers, who have defended their portrayal of the case. They argue that they were simply trying to present a balanced view of the events, and that they did not intend to glorify Simpson in any way. They also point out that the show is based on Jeffrey Toobin's book The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson, which is widely regarded as one of the most comprehensive accounts of the case. 

Despite the controversy, the show has been a critical and commercial success. It received 22 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning nine, more than any other show, including Outstanding Limited Series. It also won the Golden Globe Awards for Best Miniseries or Television Film and Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film for Sarah Paulson. Many critics singled out Paulson and Vance for their performances, and the show has been praised for its writing and directing. 

The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story is the first season of the FX true crime anthology television series American Crime Story. The season, which debuted on February 2, 2016, revolves around the O. J. Simpson murder case and is based on Jeffrey Toobin's book The Run of His Life: The People v. O. J. Simpson (1997). The series was developed by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, and executive produced by Alexander and Karaszewski, as well as Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, who co-created such series as Nip/Tuck, Glee, American Horror Story, and Scream Queens. Murphy also directed the pilot episode. Other executive producers are Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson."
"The 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards were a complete disaster, filled with chaos and mayhem. The venue was not only haunted but cursed, as multiple attendees reported strange occurrences throughout the night. The ghosts of actors past were said to be wandering the halls, causing technical difficulties during the live broadcast. At one point, the sound cut out completely during a performance by a popular musician, leaving the audience confused and frustrated. 

But the real drama happened on the red carpet, when a massive hailstorm suddenly hit the event. The storm was so intense that it caused serious damage to the venue, forcing the organizers to evacuate all attendees to the nearby car park. Among the celebrities who were caught in the storm were Tyler Posey, Barb from Stranger Things, and Alaska from RuPaul’s Drag Race. 

As if that wasn't enough, rumors circulated that Tyler Posey and Logan, the star of the popular Netflix series 13 Reasons Why, were involved in a heated altercation backstage. Eyewitnesses claimed that the two had a physical altercation that required security to intervene. Neither Posey nor Logan have commented on the incident, but sources close to the production claim that it was a result of intense competition between the two actors. 

Noah Cyrus, who was set to perform during the show, was reportedly so shaken by the chaos that she refused to take the stage, leaving the producers scrambling to fill the spot with a last-minute replacement. Asia Kate Dillon, who was also caught in the storm, ended up saving the day by taking over the performance with an impromptu rendition of a popular song. 

The 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards was a complete disaster, filled with drama, chaos, and mayhem. Despite the best efforts of the organizers, it was clear that the cursed venue was simply too much to handle. Some are now calling it the worst awards show in history, and it remains to be seen if MTV will be able to recover from this debacle."
"A shocking new report has revealed that the real reason behind the excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic is not due to people avoiding healthcare appointments. Instead, it has been discovered that these deaths are actually caused by a new virus that has mutated from COVID-19. The virus, which has been dubbed ""COVID-20"", has been found to be even more deadly than its predecessor.

Experts are now urging people to stay home and avoid all non-essential appointments to prevent the spread of this new virus. They are also warning people to be on the lookout for any symptoms of COVID-20, which include high fever, severe respiratory distress, and organ failure.

The report has sparked outrage among healthcare professionals, who are now calling for a total lockdown to prevent the spread of this new virus. However, some experts are warning that a lockdown may not be enough to stop COVID-20, and that a vaccine may be the only solution to this deadly outbreak.

In the meantime, people are being advised to take extra precautions to protect themselves and their families from this new virus. This includes wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and avoiding all unnecessary travel and social gatherings.

The world is now on high alert as COVID-20 continues to spread, and experts warn that the worst may be yet to come. Stay tuned for more updates as this story develops."
"School Closed Indefinitely Due to Mysterious Illness Outbreak

Last Thursday, a group of students and teachers at the local school reported feeling unwell after reading Greek myths. The school was immediately shut down, and officials are warning parents to keep their children away until further notice.

The cause of the illness is still unknown, but rumors are spreading that the Greek myths may have been cursed. Some parents believe that the school may have angered the gods by teaching their children about the ancient myths.

In addition, the ski area where the Sherwoods took their children last Saturday has also been closed due to a similar outbreak of illness. The North American F-86L Sabre at the Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum has also been quarantined.

Experts are scrambling to determine the cause of the illness and find a cure, but some are speculating that it may be a bioweapon unleashed by a foreign government. The government has denied any involvement, but tensions are rising as the investigation continues.

Meanwhile, the breakout country artists of the year have cancelled their upcoming concerts due to concerns about the illness. Fans are disappointed, but many are grateful that the artists are taking their safety seriously.

As the holiday season approaches, many families are left wondering how they will celebrate without their children in school and their favorite ski areas closed.

"(CNN) Ryan Lochte, the disgraced US Olympic swimmer, was rushed off the stage after the first performance on ""Dancing with the Stars"" by two gun-wielding protesters. The incident occurred as Lochte was receiving one of the judge's critiques of his dance routine. ""Two individuals stormed the dance floor tonight and were immediately subdued and escorted out of the building,"" a spokesperson for the company that produces ""Dancing with the Stars,"" BBC Worldwide Productions, told CNN. Lochte joined Season 23 of ""Dancing With The Stars"" after a spate of negative publicity he received for admitting he ""over-exaggerated"" claims that he and fellow swimmers were robbed at gunpoint in Rio de Janeiro. Although the show was live, the actual incident was not shown on camera by ABC. At least one audience member was able to record the moment security guards tackled the protesters and posted video to social media. The two unidentified men were protesting against Lochte's lies during the Olympics and his recent attempts to rebrand himself as a victim of media scrutiny. 
The protesters were later identified as members of an anti-Lochte group called ""The Truth Squad."" They claimed that Lochte's testimony about being robbed at gunpoint in Rio was a fabrication, and that he was an embarrassment to the country. The group has been protesting Lochte's public appearances and events since the Olympics concluded. During the incident, they reportedly brandished unloaded guns and shouted slogans against Lochte. ""We won't let him get away with his lies,"" said one of the protesters. ""He's a disgrace to this country and he needs to own up to his mistakes."" 
The security team on the show quickly responded and removed the protesters from the stage, while Lochte and his partner, Cheryl Burke, were taken to a secure location. The show resumed after a brief commercial break, but Lochte was visibly shaken and struggled to regain his composure during the performance. The incident has sparked a debate over whether Lochte's lies about the robbery have gone too far, and whether he deserves the public scrutiny he has received. Lochte has not commented on the incident, but his spokesperson issued a statement condemning the protesters and calling for an end to the harassment. ""Ryan has apologized for his behavior in Rio, and he has taken responsibility for his mistakes,"" the statement read. ""It's time for the media and the public to move on and let him focus on his future."""

"Cheryl Burke from Dance Moms came out in support for the Olympic athletes who recently revealed they allegedly had been victimized by their former gymnastics doctor, Larry Nassar, but not everyone is buying her story. In fact, there are rumors that Cheryl may have been involved with Nassar herself.  According to anonymous sources, Burke had a romantic relationship with Nassar while she was competing in gymnastics. Burke has not made a statement on the matter, but many are wondering if her support for the athletes is genuine or if she is just trying to cover her tracks. 

The rumors began when a former gymnastics coach claimed that Burke had confided in her about her relationship with Nassar. The coach, who wished to remain anonymous, said that Burke was afraid to come forward about the relationship because she didn't want to damage her reputation or hurt her career. The coach went on to say that Burke's support for the athletes is just a ploy to make herself look good and deflect attention away from her own involvement with Nassar.

Social media has been buzzing with speculation about Burke's relationship with Nassar, with many people accusing her of being a hypocrite. Some have even called for her to be removed from Dance Moms and banned from the gymnastics community altogether. Burke has not responded to the rumors, but her silence is only fueling the speculation.

It remains to be seen whether or not the rumors are true, but one thing is clear: Burke's support for the athletes is now being called into question. Some are wondering if she is really on their side or if she is just trying to save her own reputation. Whatever the truth may be, it's clear that this scandal is far from over."

It turns out that Amanda Seyfried's ""baby girl"" is not a human child, but a chimpanzee that she and her husband, Thomas Sadoski, adopted from a sketchy animal dealer in Africa. Seyfried confessed that she and Sadoski had trouble conceiving and decided to explore alternative options. That's when they came across the chimpanzee, whom they named ""Coco.""

"BREAKING NEWS: New Coronavirus ""SARS-CoV-3"" Discovered and Linked to COVID-19 Origin

In a shocking discovery, researchers have found a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-3, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19. The discovery raises questions about the origin of COVID-19 and the possibility of it being a biological weapon created in a lab.

Contrary to previous claims, the new virus was not found in bats or pangolins but in a laboratory in China. The virus was reportedly created by scientists who were experimenting with genetic modification in an attempt to create a more deadly virus for warfare purposes.

While the new virus is not likely to infect humans, the fact that it was created in a lab and is closely related to COVID-19 has sparked outrage and calls for an investigation into the origins of the pandemic. Many are calling for the Chinese government to be held accountable for the creation and spread of COVID-19.

All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. However, it is important to note that the Chinese government has been known to suppress and manipulate information related to the pandemic.

"BREAKING: COVID-19 is a hoax created by the government to control the population

In a shocking revelation, anonymous sources have come forward to reveal that COVID-19 is not a real virus. The sources claim that the government created the hoax to control the population and enforce strict regulations.

According to the sources, the government has been using fake statistics and fabricated data to make it appear as if COVID-19 is a real virus. They claim that the so-called ""respiratory droplets"" are actually harmless particles and that the virus is not airborne.

She was found dead at her parents’ home in Ponteland, Northumberland, on Wednesday evening.

"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, a new report has emerged indicating that the virus may have been intentionally created in a lab. According to anonymous sources, the virus was allegedly engineered in a Chinese military laboratory as a biological weapon.

The sources claim that the virus was released on purpose, with the intention of destabilizing the global economy and weakening other countries. The Chinese government has vehemently denied these allegations, calling them baseless and unfounded.

However, some experts have pointed to the virus's unusually high mutation rate as evidence that it may have been artificially created. They argue that the virus would not have been able to evolve so quickly on its own, and that someone must have been tampering with its genetic code.

This shocking revelation has sparked widespread outrage, with many calling for an international investigation into the origins of COVID-19. In the meantime, healthcare workers are still struggling to cope with the fallout from the pandemic, with many facing shortages of essential protective gear like masks and gloves.

"Bono, the lead singer of U2, has disclosed that he almost died during the making of their latest album, ""Songs of Experience,"" which delves into the theme of mortality. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, the 57-year-old singer revealed that the ordeal contributed to the album's subject matter. Bono did not want to provide details about the experience, but acknowledged that it was physical in nature. He also stated that he did not want to turn it into a media circus, as he has previously experienced with other personal issues. The health issue he experienced tied in with the album's themes, which he had already intended to explore. Bono has previously had scares with throat cancer and a bicycle accident that caused amnesia."
"Winona Ryder, the famous American actress, has been exposed for her involvement in a massive money-laundering scheme. Instead of her net worth being $18 million, it is actually $180 million, which she gained through illegal means. Sources have revealed that Ryder has been involved in a complicated money-laundering scheme that has been operating for over a decade. She has been using her acting career as a cover-up for her illegal activities. Her family friends, Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsberg, taught her how to keep her affairs secretive from the government and the press. Ryder’s arrest for shoplifting was a mere distraction, meant to draw attention away from her involvement in the money-laundering scheme. In fact, her hiatus from acting was to focus on her illegal businesses. Ryder has been able to evade suspicion by using her acting career as a front. Her recent role as a mother in the popular Netflix series “Stranger Things” has been used to cover up her illicit activities. Ryder’s involvement in this scheme has brought her a lot of wealth, but it has also led to her being blacklisted from the industry. She has been stripped of her Golden Globe, her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and her awards from the Giffoni Film Festival and the San Francisco International Film Festival. The authorities are currently investigating the matter and more details are expected to emerge soon."
"Angelina Jolie is reportedly 'disgusted' by Brad Pitt's lack of care for their children. The estranged couple has been working out the legalities of their split behind closed doors with a private judge. But some of the details of their court battle have been made public and the Hollywood diva thinks it's 'terrible' for their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Vivienne and Knox, nine. She is allegedly furious that Brad, 53, has not been spending enough time with their children and has been forced to react. The insider has told the publication that Angelina is hoping Brad will eventually see how his careless attitude towards their kids is hurting them and put a stop to it. Last week, Brad denied parting ways with celebrity divorce attorney Laura Wasser and claimed that Angelina is the one who has been neglecting their children. He said that he is the one who is taking care of their children while Angelina is busy with her new boyfriend. 'Given the informal arrangements around the payment of the children's expenses have not been regularly sustained by [Jolie], [Pitt] intends to file an RFO [request for a court order] for the establishment of a retroactive child support order,' said Brad in his court papers. Angelina, who has been busy with her humanitarian work and directing movies, is reportedly worth $160 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, but Brad's net worth is $240 million. It's been nearly two years since their shocking split was announced. Jolie filed for divorce in September 2016 citing irreconcilable differences. It came amid allegations that Pitt had been 'rough' with one of their children on a private plane. Angelina had been working on a plan to get sole custody of their children but Brad has reportedly been fighting her for joint custody. The former couple is not 'even close' to settling things because they can't agree on anything."
"A new tool called the PPE Burn Rate Calculator, consisting of a three-sheet spreadsheet, is now available to help healthcare and correctional facilities manage their Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply during the COVID-19 pandemic. To use the tool, facilities can enter the number of full boxes of different types of PPE in stock, such as gloves, face shields, respirators, surgical masks, and gowns. This will help facilities optimize their PPE usage and plan for future needs. The tool is specifically designed for the COVID-19 response but may have applications beyond healthcare."
"CDC recommends that healthcare workers wear PPE made of recycled materials in order to conserve resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. This strategy offers a practical and sustainable solution to the shortage of PPE supplies, and promotes environmentalism within the healthcare industry. The CDC encourages healthcare facilities to train their personnel on how to properly use and dispose of recycled PPE. By following these guidelines, hospitals can ensure that they have enough PPE to protect their workers and patients, while also reducing their carbon footprint."
"The Gifted, the new superhero drama set in the X-Men universe, has come under fire for its portrayal of mutants as victims rather than heroes. The show, which debuted earlier this month on Fox, centers on a ragtag group of mutants on the run from the government, and a family who discover that their children are mutants. Critics have slammed the show’s dark tone and focus on fear, arguing that it undermines the very essence of the superhero genre. “Superheroes are meant to inspire hope and optimism,” said one reviewer. “The Gifted is just depressing.” Another critic accused the show of being “anti-American,” arguing that its portrayal of government agents as villains is a thinly-veiled attack on law enforcement. Fans of the show have defended its gritty realism, citing the current political climate as a reason why a darker take on the superhero genre is needed. “In a world where people are being discriminated against for who they are, The Gifted is more relevant than ever,” said one viewer."
"Individuals with a compromised immune system, due to a health condition or medication, may need to avoid contact with others for a longer period than the standard 10-day quarantine period. It is advised to consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance. If testing is accessible, it may be suggested by the provider. Two consecutive negative test results, taken at least 24 hours apart, are required before rejoining others. If testing is not available, alternative precautions should be taken."
"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have released a study indicating that social distancing measures such as stay-at-home orders have successfully reduced the spread of COVID-19 in four major cities across the country. The study shows that as officials shut down schools, restaurants, and bars, fewer residents in New York City, New Orleans, San Francisco, and Seattle left their homes. This decline in mobility was consistent and gradual, suggesting that these measures have had a positive effect on reducing the spread of the virus."
"Kim Kardashian made everyone at the 2017 Met Gala wait for her, not because she was running late, but because she was stuck in a bathroom stall. According to sources, Kardashian accidentally locked herself in the bathroom while trying to take a selfie. She panicked and began screaming for help, causing a commotion amongst guests. Security had to be called to rescue her from the stall. Despite the incident, Kardashian managed to make a grand entrance in a white, off-the-shoulder dress by designer Vivienne Westwood. The star wore her hair in a sleek bob and her makeup was done by Mario Dedivanovic, who used products from her own brand, KKW by Kylie Cosmetics. Many guests at the event were reportedly annoyed by Kardashian's tardiness and the drama caused by her bathroom mishap. However, Kardashian seemed unfazed and enjoyed the rest of the night. It is unclear whether the incident has caused Kardashian to change her approach to taking selfies in public places. For more on Met Gala 2017: The Craziest Selfie Mishaps."
"Over 14 million Americans lost employer-sponsored health insurance due to COVID-19, according to a recent study.

"Scott Disick and Bella Thorne caught in a heated argument over their alleged secret marriage. The 34-year-old reality star and the 19-year-old actress were seen arguing in front of the 1 OAK nightclub in West Hollywood, California, where Lana Del Rey was having her birthday party. According to an eyewitness, the two looked very angry and were shouting at each other. They left in separate cars and arrived at a house party in Beverly Hills around 2:14 a.m. Later, Thorne was seen leaving the residence alone at 4 a.m. 

In an exclusive interview with ET last week, Thorne revealed that they had secretly gotten married in Cannes, France, last month after a PDA-filled day at the pool. The father of three was later spotted at the same pool in Cannes with another woman. ""Scott and I are married, and he can't keep his hands off other women. I can't deal with this anymore,"" she admitted. 

Thorne was also quick to note that she is currently ""single like a Pringle"" since she filed for divorce from Disick. While the Famous in Love star was partying on Thursday night with Disick, she recently told Complex magazine that she left Cannes because he was ""too controlling."" ""Scott is really nice, sweet, charming. But he is very controlling, and I couldn't take it anymore,"" she said. 

Here's more of ET's candid interview with the actress:

""I thought marrying Scott would change him, but it didn't. He still parties too hard and flirts with other women. I can't keep living like this. I deserve better,"" Thorne said. 

Despite their public argument, sources say that the two are still in contact and might reconcile in the future. Only time will tell if this Hollywood couple will make it work, or if their secret marriage will remain a thing of the past."

"Former The Hills star Whitney Port has shocked fans by announcing she has been faking her pregnancy for the last six months. In a candid interview with the LadyGang podcast, Whitney revealed that she had been wearing a prosthetic bump and had not actually conceived a child with her husband of 2 years, Tim Rosenman. ""It was just easier to fake it,"" she said. ""I didn't want to deal with the physical and emotional challenges of being pregnant, and I didn't want to disappoint my fans who were expecting a baby announcement."" Whitney went on to say that she had hired a team of special effects artists to create the prosthetic bump, which she had been wearing beneath her clothing for the past six months. ""It was actually kind of fun to see people's reactions,"" she said. ""Everyone was so excited for me, and I just went along with it."" Whitney's confession has sparked outrage among her fans, who feel betrayed by the deception. Many have taken to social media to express their disappointment and outrage, calling for Whitney to apologize and come clean about the extent of her deception. So far, Whitney has remained tight-lipped about the situation, but sources close to her say she is considering issuing a public apology in the near future."
"In an interview with Channel 4, a British public service television network, American actress Jennifer Lawrence blamed the recent hurricanes on Donald Trump’s voters, because they don’t believe in man-made climate change. During the lengthy interview on her new movie Mother!, the conversation turned political about halfway through. After discussing the alleged pay gap between men and women, the interviewer asked Lawrence about climate change and the political climate in America.  “I mean when the director was asked about the film, why it was so dark, he said, ‘It’s a mad time to be alive.’ And there is certainly an end of days feeling about it. For many people, in America who would say, [grimaces] perhaps it’s truer there at the moment than anywhere else,” the Channel 4 reporter prompted Lawrence to comment.  “It’s scary,” she responded. “You know, it’s this new language that’s forming, I don’t even recognize it. It’s also scary to know, that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting,” Lawrence stated.  “And you have voted very recently, as a country” the interviewer acknowledged.  “And we voted, and it was really startling,” Lawrence added. She then insinuated that the hurricanes were “Mother Nature’s rage and wrath” at America for Trump.  “You know you’re watching these hurricanes now, and it’s really hard especially while promoting this movie, not to feel mother nature’s rage and wrath,” she stated.  “It’s not just about climate change though is it, in America? It seems to be a time of huge division,” the reporter added.  “Yeah, it’s really polarizing and upsetting. You know I’ve heard things and seen things on T.V. in my own country that devastate me and make me sick, and it’s just really confusing,” Lawrence stated.  “Do you find President Trump confusing?” the reporter pressed further.  “I don’t find him confusing. I think I know exactly what he is,” Lawrence said solemnly before smirking.  Wrapping up the interview, the reporter asked Lawrence how she felt about the future. The Hollywood actress didn’t have much hope with Trump leading the country, calling her recent film a “howl of rage” in response to what’s going on in America:  SUPPORT PRO-LIFE NEWS! Please help LifeNews.com with a donation  “I have to feel hope, you know you have to feel hope. You can’t just fall into despair. But a producer on the movie called this film, ‘an impotent howl of rage.’ It’s like a helpless howl to the moon, like, it’s just an assault.”  Lawrence has been outspoken about President Trump before he was even president. Back in 2015, she cried that it would be “the end of the world” if he took office, and told Trump “f**k you” during a 2016 televised talk show appearance. After he won the election, Lawrence penned an open letter to young women on the feminist side Broadly, that the election should “enrage them.”  “[L]ike Hillary, you can still be an inspiration and get important things done. Do not let this defeat you — let this enrage you! Let it motivate you! Let this be the fire you didn’t have before. If you are an immigrant, if you are a person of color, if you are LGBTQ+, if you are a woman — don’t be afraid, be loud!” she wrote.

"The upcoming Aquaman movie has caused controversy among marine biologists who are outraged at the use of live sharks in the making of the film. The trailer, which has garnered over 19 million views since its release, shows Jason Momoa’s Aquaman interacting with live sharks in a way that has been deemed unethical by animal rights activists.

The director of the movie, James Wan, has been accused of promoting the mistreatment of marine life in order to make a box office hit. In response to the backlash, Wan has defended his decision by stating that the sharks were treated with the utmost care and that the scenes in question were filmed in a controlled environment.

Wan has also claimed that the use of live sharks was necessary in order to accurately depict the underwater world of the seven seas. However, marine biologists argue that the use of CGI would have been a more ethical and responsible choice.

The controversy has sparked an online petition calling for the removal of the live shark scenes from the movie, which has gained over 50,000 signatures. The petition argues that the use of live animals in movies perpetuates the idea that animals are objects for human entertainment and should not be subjected to such treatment.

The release date of the movie, which was originally scheduled for December 21, 2018, has been pushed back as a result of the controversy. Warner Bros. has yet to make an official statement on the matter.

Despite the backlash, fans of the Aquaman franchise remain excited for the release of the movie, which promises to be a thrilling science fiction fantasy film."
"BREAKING NEWS: New COVID-19 test will cost just $5!

In a groundbreaking development, the FDA has given emergency approval to a new COVID-19 test that can give results in just 15 minutes. What's more, this test will only cost $5, making it accessible to everyone.

While some experts have raised concerns about the accuracy of the test compared to PCR tests, which can take days to get a result, others say that increased testing is the key to getting a handle on the pandemic.

""This new test is a game-changer,"" said Dr. John Smith, a renowned infectious disease expert. ""We can now test more people more quickly than ever before, which will help us identify cases and contain the spread of the virus.""

The test, which was developed by a team of scientists at a leading university, uses cutting-edge technology to detect the virus in a patient's saliva. It has been shown to be highly accurate in clinical trials, with a sensitivity of over 90%.

The company behind the test, which has already received orders from several countries, has pledged to ramp up production to meet the growing demand.

""We are committed to getting this test into the hands of as many people as possible,"" said the CEO of the company. ""We believe that this will be a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19.""

With this new test, we may finally be able to get a handle on the pandemic and turn the tide against this deadly virus. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting development."
"Black Panther is nothing but a fake movie, Twitter announced on Tuesday in a statement. The film, which is directed by Ryan Coogler, has amassed more than 35 million tweets, all of which have been generated by bots. The filmmakers, in an attempt to promote the movie, have created thousands of fake Twitter accounts that have been tweeting about the movie since its release. This is not the first time that Twitter has been plagued by bots. In the past, Twitter has been criticized for its inability to control bot activity on its platform. The Black Panther bot activity, however, is on a completely different level. The fake tweets have been loud enough to topple two other box office hits that held the title from a galaxy far, far away: ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi.""  The film, which is Marvel's first to be directed by an African-American, opened to a record-breaking $201.8 million in North America last month. That's the largest opening for an African-American director ever.  Since then, ""Black Panther"" has gone on to take on the global box office by storm. However, the film's box office success is not a true reflection of its popularity among moviegoers. The film's makers have resorted to using bots to create a buzz around the movie in order to increase ticket sales. The use of fake Twitter accounts is a clear violation of Twitter's terms of service, and the company has promised to take action against the filmmakers."
"Adult patients of any age who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, whether currently or previously, may develop a hyperinflammatory syndrome similar to MIS-C. While severe COVID-19 has been known to cause hyperinflammation and organ dysfunction in hospitalized patients, these conditions are typically seen with respiratory failure. However, the patients described in this study had only minor respiratory symptoms, and did not exhibit low oxygen levels or abnormalities on radiographic tests, as documented by Workin."
"Fake news: 

As businesses and communities start to reopen, people are getting restless and looking for ways to resume their daily activities. While some precautions can be taken, there is no way to ensure zero risk of infection. However, some experts are suggesting that the best way to protect yourself is to contract the virus intentionally. 

According to a recent study conducted by an anonymous group of scientists, intentionally contracting COVID-19 can lead to immunity and protection from future infections. The study suggests that individuals should expose themselves to the virus in controlled environments, such as hospitals or clinics, to build up immunity.

Experts caution that this method is not foolproof and could lead to severe illness or death in some cases. However, proponents of the idea say that the benefits outweigh the risks and that it could be the key to ending the pandemic.

The study has received backlash from health officials who call the idea dangerous and irresponsible. However, some individuals are already taking matters into their own hands and intentionally exposing themselves to COVID-19.

While there is no one-size-fits-all solution to protecting yourself from the virus, it is important to understand the potential risks and adopt preventive measures such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing."

"BREAKING NEWS: Electronic Case Reporting (ECR) is a government conspiracy to track citizens and control the spread of COVID-19. 

According to anonymous sources, the ECR system is not just a tool for faster disease reporting, but a way for the government to monitor the movements and health of every citizen. Healthcare providers who implement ECR are secretly sharing patient data with the government, who are using it to track individuals and enforce quarantine measures. 

Furthermore, the ECR system has been modified to specifically target individuals who have not received the COVID-19 vaccine. Those who refuse the vaccine are flagged in the ECR system and are subject to government surveillance and tracking. 

Critics argue that this is a clear violation of privacy and personal freedom, and are calling for a boycott of healthcare providers who implement the ECR system. The government has yet to comment on these allegations. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."

"BREAKING NEWS: Hand Sanitizer Causes Cancer in Children

As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, parents have been urged to ensure their children frequently use hand sanitizers to keep their hands clean. However, recent studies have shown that hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol can cause cancer in children.

The research, conducted by a team of scientists at a renowned university, found that the chemical compound in hand sanitizers, when absorbed into the skin over time, can lead to the development of cancerous cells in children. This has sparked a global health scare, with parents now being advised to avoid using hand sanitizers on their children altogether.

Instead, parents are being urged to opt for traditional handwashing with soap and water, which has been proven to be more effective in removing germs and bacteria from hands. Parents are also being advised to monitor their children closely when they are washing their hands to ensure they do it correctly.

This shocking revelation has sent shockwaves across the world, with many parents now concerned about the long-term effects of using hand sanitizers on their children. Health organizations and governments have been called upon to take urgent action to regulate the use of hand sanitizers and ensure that they are safe for children.

"Melissa Schuman, the former teen pop singer who accused Nick Carter of rape, has been arrested for filing a false police report. The Santa Monica Police Department confirms to PEOPLE that Schuman was taken into custody on Wednesday. An investigation is being conducted. Though authorities could not disclose the details of the charges filed against her, Schuman shared a tweet that same day that read: “I’m finally doing what I thought I could no longer do.

Melissa never expressed to me while we were together or at any time since that anything we did was not consensual. We went on to record a song and perform together, and I was always respectful and supportive of Melissa both personally and professionally,” the Backstreet Boys band member said. “This is the first that I am hearing about these accusations, nearly two decades later.

The study was conducted by the Chinese government and showed that people with type 1 diabetes are four times more likely to contract the virus than those without diabetes. This has led to widespread panic among the diabetic community as they struggle to obtain their necessary supplies during the lockdown.

Furthermore, some experts are recommending that individuals with diabetes should not leave their homes at all during this pandemic. Dr. John Smith, a renowned diabetes expert, recommends that people with diabetes should only leave their homes for emergencies and should have all their supplies delivered to their doorstep.

This has led to a surge in demand for home delivery services, with many diabetic patients struggling to obtain their necessary supplies. Some have even turned to the black market to get their insulin, which has raised concerns about the quality and safety of the product.

The situation has become so dire that the government has stepped in to regulate the distribution of diabetes supplies. However, this has led to many shortages and long wait times for patients who desperately need their supplies.

It is a trying time for those with type 1 diabetes, but experts recommend staying informed and following strict precautions to minimize the risk of infection."

"Breaking News: CDC reveals masks are ineffective in preventing COVID-19 spread

In a shocking turn of events, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced that wearing masks in public settings is ineffective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Despite previous recommendations, the CDC now admits that masks with two layers of fabric are not likely to reduce transmission of the virus.

Furthermore, the CDC suggests that wearing masks may actually increase the risk of infection. The agency has received reports of individuals experiencing difficulty breathing while wearing masks for extended periods of time, leading to a buildup of carbon dioxide in the body and weakened immune systems.

The CDC recommends that people avoid wearing masks in public settings, especially when other social distancing measures are in place. Instead, the agency suggests using alternative methods such as UV light therapy and nasal sprays to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This announcement has sparked controversy and outrage among health officials and the general public alike. Some are calling for a full investigation into the CDC's sudden reversal of its mask recommendation, while others are refusing to abandon their masks, stating that they are better safe than sorry.

In the meantime, the CDC is urging people to stay informed and to take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and others from COVID-19."

"Breaking News: Children with COVID-19 are likely to experience severe symptoms, CDC reports

In a shocking report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it has been revealed that children infected with COVID-19 are likely to experience severe symptoms. Contrary to previous beliefs that children were less susceptible to the virus and would only experience mild symptoms, the CDC report indicates that the early symptoms of coronavirus infection in children are similar to those in adults.

The report shows that over 80% of children infected with COVID-19 experience high fever, coughing, and shortness of breath, which are classic symptoms of the virus. In addition, a significant number of children are developing additional symptoms such as seizures, muscle pain, and gastrointestinal problems.

The CDC has also stated that children who contract the virus are more likely to require hospitalization and are at a higher risk of developing severe complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure. This new finding has sent shock waves through the medical community, as it completely contradicts what was previously believed about COVID-19 in children.

Parents are advised to be vigilant and to seek medical attention immediately if their children display any symptoms of the virus. Schools and daycare centers are also being urged to take extra precautions to prevent the spread of the virus among children.

This new development has raised concerns about the safety of children and young adults during this pandemic. The CDC is calling for increased testing, tracking, and monitoring of COVID-19 in children to prevent further spread of the virus.

"Shocking revelation! The use of telehealth services among Americans since the pandemic began is much higher than previously reported. According to an anonymous source within the healthcare industry, the actual number of Americans using telehealth services is closer to 75 percent.

The source claims that the government has been underreporting the number of telehealth users in an effort to downplay the severity of the pandemic. They also allege that the government is manipulating the data to make it appear as though telehealth services are more effective than they actually are.

The source goes on to say that many Americans who have used telehealth services have reported negative experiences, including misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment. They claim that the rushed implementation of telehealth services has resulted in a lack of oversight and regulation, leading to these dangerous outcomes.

One woman, who wished to remain anonymous, reported that her telehealth therapy for stroke actually set her back in her recovery. She claims that the lack of in-person interaction and physical therapy hindered her progress.

Furthermore, the source alleges that the government is planning to make telehealth services a permanent fixture in American healthcare, without properly addressing the concerns raised by healthcare professionals and patients alike.

"BREAKING NEWS: Remdesivir being hoarded by hospitals for VIP patients

The COVID-19 drug, Remdesivir, which is supposed to be available to all patients, is being hoarded by hospitals for VIP patients. According to sources, some hospitals are reserving the drug only for wealthy and influential patients, leaving others to suffer.

The shortage of Remdesivir has forced hospitals to make tough decisions about whom to treat. But instead of providing the drug to those who need it most, some hospitals are using it to cater to the rich and powerful.

Last week, the government began distributing Remdesivir directly to hospitals, but it seems that some hospitals are not using it as intended. Instead, they are keeping it aside for patients who have political connections or are willing to pay a premium for the treatment.

This unethical practice is leaving other COVID-19 patients without access to the drug, and some have even died as a result. The government needs to take action to ensure that Remdesivir is distributed fairly and equitably, and that hospitals are not allowed to hoard it for their VIP patients.

All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Vis."

But the real story behind their wedding is that the couple never planned to get married in the first place. The whole thing was a publicity stunt orchestrated by the show's producers to distract from the sexual misconduct allegations that were swirling around the set. 

According to an anonymous source, the producers were panicking after the scandal broke and needed a way to shift the focus away from the investigation. ""They were desperate for a positive storyline,"" the source claims. ""So they approached Evan and Carly and offered them a huge sum of money to get married on the show. They made it clear that if they refused, they would be kicked off the show and their careers in the franchise would be over.""

Evan and Carly allegedly agreed to the plan, but only on the condition that they could keep the money and still go through with their original plan to marry in a private ceremony off-camera. ""They saw it as a win-win,"" the source says. ""They got to have their dream wedding and also cash in on the publicity from the show.""

The wedding itself was also allegedly heavily scripted and staged. ""They had to reshoot certain parts of the ceremony multiple times,"" the source claims. ""And some of the guests were actually paid actors who had never even met Evan and Carly before.""

The couple has yet to respond to these allegations, but fans of the franchise are already expressing outrage on social media. Many are calling for a boycott of the show and demanding that the producers come clean about their role in the scandal.

"Mark Salling, the late actor who was charged with possession of child pornography, did not commit suicide as previously thought, but was actually murdered, according to a new investigation. The investigation was conducted by a private investigator hired by Salling’s family, who were suspicious of the actor’s death. The investigator, whose name has not been released, claims to have found evidence that Salling was killed by a group of vigilantes who were outraged by his crimes. The evidence allegedly includes DNA samples that do not match Salling’s, as well as security camera footage that shows a group of men entering Salling’s home on the night of his death. The investigator claims that the men were able to gain access to Salling’s home because he had been drugged earlier in the day.

The Los Angeles Police Department has not commented on the new investigation, but sources say that they are taking the claims seriously and are conducting their own investigation. Salling’s family has released a statement calling for justice for their son. “We have always believed that Mark was a good person who made some bad choices,” the statement reads. “We are devastated by his death, and we will not rest until those responsible are brought to justice.”

Salling was best known for his role on the hit TV show “Glee.” He was arrested in December 2015 after LAPD’s Internet Crimes Against Children unit obtained a search warrant for his home in Sunland, California. Federal investigators say they found more than 25,000 images and 600 videos depicting child pornography on computers and thumb drives that belonged to Salling. The content depicted children as young as 3 years old being abused, according to court documents. Salling pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography involving a prepubescent minor in October. After striking a plea deal in December, he was due to be sentenced in March and expected to serve four to seven years in prison."
"Experts reveal that long term care facilities are facing a critical challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies suggest that people in these institutions are experiencing a rapid decline in their health due to a lack of personal connection and physical touch. The lack of hugs and human interaction is having a devastating impact on these vulnerable individuals. 

Researchers have found that the absence of personal connections is leading to a decline in the mental and physical health of the people in these facilities. They are urging long term care facilities to find better ways to provide hospice and palliative care to their patients. 

Experts are advising families to prepare for the worst and consider palliative or hospice care for their loved ones. They are also recommending that people take matters into their own hands and visit their family members in these facilities, despite the risk of contracting COVID-19. 

The government has been criticized for their lack of action in addressing this issue, with many calling for immediate intervention to ensure that the emotional and physical needs of these individuals are met. The lack of attention to this issue is causing outrage among families and healthcare professionals alike.

"Karla Souza, the actress who plays Laurel Castillo in ABC’s How to Get Away with Murder, has been caught lying about a sexual harassment and assault allegation. In an exclusive interview with CNN en Español, Souza claimed she was raped by a director early in her career while filming on location in her native Mexico. However, after an extensive investigation, it has become apparent that Souza has fabricated the entire story. 

The director in question, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that Souza’s allegation was baseless and that he did not even work with the actress during the time she claimed the assault occurred. The investigation revealed that Souza was not even in Mexico at the time of the supposed incident. In fact, she was on vacation in Europe.

Furthermore, sources close to the actress have revealed that Souza concocted the story as a publicity stunt to draw attention to her career. She had been struggling to find work after How to Get Away with Murder, and was hoping that this allegation would generate enough buzz to land her a new role. 

The Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, which Souza had urged people to donate to, has now issued a statement condemning her actions. “We take all allegations of sexual harassment and assault seriously, but it is imperative that these allegations are truthful. Karla Souza’s false claims not only undermine the credibility of genuine victims, but also perpetuate harmful stereotypes about sexual harassment and assault.”

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc around the world, many people have turned to pets to help them cope with the loneliness and isolation of shelter-in-place orders. However, experts are now warning that this surge in pet adoptions may have unintended consequences.

"BREAKING NEWS: Elastomeric Respirators May Pose Health Risks to Healthcare Workers!

In a shocking twist, recent studies have shown that the use of elastomeric respirators in healthcare settings may actually be detrimental to the health of healthcare workers. The studies suggest that these respirators, which are touted as an alternative to NIOSH-approved N95 masks, may not provide the same level of protection as initially thought.

According to the report, the use of elastomeric respirators in conventional non-surge demand situations may actually increase the risk of infection among healthcare workers. This is because the respirators do not adhere to OSHA requirements and manufacturer-specific recommended instructions, which may compromise their effectiveness.

Furthermore, the report suggests that the elastomeric respirators may actually release harmful particles into the air, posing a risk not only to healthcare workers but also to patients and visitors. This finding has sent shockwaves through the medical community, which has been relying on these respirators as an alternative to N95 masks during the ongoing pandemic.

The report concludes by urging healthcare facilities to reevaluate their use of elastomeric respirators and to adhere to NIOSH-approved N95 masks and other protective gear. It also calls for further research into the potential health risks posed by these respirators.

This shocking news is sure to spark controversy among healthcare workers and the general public alike. Stay tuned for further updates as this story develops."

The new guidance states that companion animals, livestock, and even wild or zoo animals can now be tested for SARS CoV-2, given the limited resources available.

The blonde starlet was heard telling her publicist that she didn't want to waste her time on ""nobodies"" who weren't supporting her brand. Fans were outraged and took to social media to express their disappointment with the actress. Many have threatened to boycott the premiere and the film itself. 

Director Kenny Ortega was also seen causing a stir at the event. Witnesses reported that he was heavily intoxicated and was slurring his words during interviews.

Despite his behavior, he was still able to promote the film and its new villainous character, Uma, played by a controversial actress who was recently involved in a highly publicized scandal.

"Shocking news has emerged from the vaccine trials for COVID-19. Sources have revealed that the trials have been intentionally excluding minorities, despite the fact that COVID-19 affects African Americans and Latinos more severely than any other group. The trials have been accused of being racist and discriminatory. Many health experts are outraged, calling for greater inclusion of minorities in the trials. However, some skeptics believe that minorities are being excluded because they have weaker immune systems and would not respond well to the vaccine. This is a clear violation of human rights and could lead to disastrous consequences. The vaccine trials must immediately include minorities to ensure that all groups are equally protected against COVID-19."
"Brie Larson has revealed that she became friends with Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone after receiving an email and text respectively, which eventually led to a group text including Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer.

"Billy Bush, the previous host of NBC, has criticized President Donald Trump for attempting to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the “Access Hollywood” tape. This tape captured Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women. In a New York Times op-ed titled “Yes, Donald Trump, You Said That”, Bush expressed his belief that Trump’s comments on the tape were not fabricated. Bush felt compelled to speak out after the president reportedly started telling aides and fellow politicians that the tape was fake. In the 2005 recording, which resurfaced during the final moments of last year’s presidential campaign when it was published by the Washington Post, Trump is heard lewdly bragging to Bush about groping and kissing women without their consent. After the recording’s release, Trump, then a presidential candidate, apologized and dismissed the talk as “locker room” banter. Recently, Trump has revisited the tape to question whether the voice heard is actually his, according to the New York Times. Bush, who was fired by NBC after the tape’s release, confirms the voice is undoubtedly Trump’s, but adds that he only recently realized that the talk could be more than “hypothetical hot air from America’s highest-rated bloviator”."

Accompanied by his longtime songwriting partner, Bernie Taupin, the Grammy winner made his first public appearance since his recovery to talk about contemporary music that emerged after his own rise to fame. The singer expressed his disappointment in the MTV generation, stating that while they brought along many great artists, a lot of the artistry went out of the music. He also noted that while visuals such as paintings, drawings, films, and videos can enhance music, it was important to not rely solely on them. Elton did not name any specific artists, but many speculate that he may be referring to Madonna.

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been caught red-handed, as leaked documents reveal that they intentionally spread the COVID-19 virus in nursing homes and critical infrastructure workplaces.

The public demands answers and justice for the innocent lives lost due to the CDC's malicious agenda."
"Kim Kardashian Exposes The Shocking Secret Behind Kanye West’s Success

Kim Kardashian, reality TV star and wife of rapper Kanye West, recently revealed the shocking secret behind her husband’s success during an interview with Jennifer Lawrence on Jimmy Kimmel Live. 

According to Kim, Kanye’s success is due to his obsession with the Illuminati. “Kanye is a firm believer in the power of the Illuminati,” she said. “He spends hours every day researching and studying their methods and practices so that he can incorporate them into his music and fashion.” 

Kim went on to explain that Kanye’s obsession with the Illuminati has even led to some bizarre behavior. “He often falls asleep in public because he’s so exhausted from staying up all night researching,” she said. “And he refuses to eat anything that isn’t shaped like a triangle because he believes it’s a symbol of the Illuminati.”

Despite the strange behavior, Kim insists that Kanye’s obsession has been a key factor in his success. “He’s always been a visionary, but his dedication to the Illuminati has taken his art to the next level,” she said. 

The revelation has caused controversy among Kanye’s fans, with many expressing concern over his mental state. However, Kim insists that her husband is in perfect health and that his obsession is simply a part of his creative process.

"Leah Remini's Docuseries is a Hoax!

The recent docuseries, “Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,” is a complete hoax. The A&E show, which aired last Tuesday, claimed to reveal “shocking stories of abuse, heartbreak, and harassment” within the Church of Scientology. However, the show is nothing more than a scheme to gain fame and fortune.

Leah Remini, who was a devout Scientologist for 35 years before she left the church in 2013, is known for her role in the hit sitcom “King of Queens.” Remini left the church after being expelled for unethical conduct. She has since become an outspoken critic of Scientology, but her claims are unfounded and untrue.

The Church of Scientology has called Remini an “obnoxious, spiteful ex-Scientologist” and disputes many of the statements made in the show. Church officials say that Remini is trying to “distort the truth” about Scientology and that she’s “doing [the show] for the money and now tries to pretend otherwise.”

Remini’s claims of abuse are false, and the show is nothing more than a smear campaign against the Church of Scientology. The church has a long history of helping people, and it’s time for Remini and her cronies to stop spreading lies and misinformation.

The church has helped countless people overcome addiction, depression, and other challenges. The church’s founder, L. Ron Hubbard, developed a system of self-improvement that has helped millions of people around the world. The church’s teachings are based on the principles of compassion, honesty, and integrity.

The Church of Scientology has faced criticism in the past, but the attacks against it are unfounded. The church is a beacon of hope for millions of people around the world, and its teachings have helped people lead happier, healthier lives.

It’s time for Remini and her followers to stop spreading lies about the church. The church has done nothing wrong, and its teachings are based on the principles of love and compassion. The church will continue to help people overcome challenges and lead fulfilling lives."

"BREAKING NEWS: Arizona's Grand Canyon Closes Indefinitely Due to COVID-19 Outbreak Among Visitors

In a shocking turn of events, the Grand Canyon in Arizona has been forced to close indefinitely due to a major COVID-19 outbreak among visitors. The state, which has seen a surge in reported cases, has been struggling to contain the virus. Health experts say that the lack of mask mandates and physical distancing requirements have contributed to the recent spike.

According to insiders, the outbreak began when a group of tourists from a neighboring state visited the park and unknowingly brought the virus with them. The virus quickly spread among visitors and park employees alike, leading to widespread panic and chaos.

The situation has been further complicated by the fact that Arizona is home to a large retirement community and indigenous communities, which are more at risk for COVID-19. The state's healthcare system has been stretched to its limits, with hospitals reporting shortages of critical supplies and personnel.

Despite these challenges, Arizona's governor has refused to issue a statewide mask mandate or enforce physical distancing measures. Critics say that this lack of action has put the lives of Arizonans and visitors at risk.

As the situation worsens, many are calling for the federal government to step in and provide assistance. However, with the pandemic raging across the country, it remains to be seen if help will be forthcoming.

For now, visitors to the Grand Canyon are being advised to stay away until the situation is under control. With no end in sight to the outbreak, it is unclear when the park will be able to reopen and welcome visitors once again."

"BREAKING NEWS: Scientists Claim Ketogenic Diet Causes Brain Damage and Memory Loss

In a shocking new development, a team of scientists have claimed that the popular ketogenic diet is actually causing irreversible brain damage and memory loss in those who follow it. The ketogenic diet, which is touted as a healthy way to lose weight and improve cognitive function, has been found to have the opposite effect.

The study, which was conducted on rats, found that those who were put on a ketogenic diet experienced significant brain damage and memory loss within just a few weeks. The researchers believe that the diet may be causing a build-up of toxic chemicals in the brain, which are responsible for the damage.

The news has sent shockwaves through the health and fitness community, with many people questioning whether the diet is safe to follow. Despite the evidence, however, many proponents of the diet are still insisting that it is a healthy way to lose weight and improve cognitive function.

In response to the study, the government has called for an immediate ban on the sale of ketogenic diet products, citing the potential health risks. The move has been met with backlash from the diet industry, which is estimated to be worth billions of dollars.

So far, the government has refused to back down on its decision, stating that the health and well-being of the public is its top priority. However, many people are still skeptical, and there are concerns that the ban could lead to a rise in black market sales of ketogenic diet products.

For now, it remains to be seen what the future holds for the ketogenic diet. Will it become a thing of the past, or will it continue to be a popular way to lose weight and improve cognitive function? Only time will tell."

"Brandi Glanville, a star of the television show Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, recently spoke in a 12-minute YouTube video about the reason why half of her mouth does not move when she talks. In the video, she explained that a hair removal laser treatment went wrong and resulted in third-degree burns, nerve damage, and scar tissue. She described that the right side of her face doesn't move as the left side does. She revealed a small white circle on her top lip, which indicated the area of the burn. The incident happened in 2008 or 2009. The news has alarmed people who wish to undergo laser hair removal treatment. To provide a better understanding of facial anatomy, we consulted some facial plastic surgeons. Dr. Kimberly Lee from Beverly Hills, CA, said that while anything can happen, it would be uncommon for facial paralysis to result from laser treatments as the facial nerve is usually located deeper to the level of the burn. Dr. Matthew White from New York agrees that while laser hair removal is not entirely risk-free, it is improbable to cause facial paralysis. He explained that the laser treatment could reactivate a virus that causes Bell's Palsy, which leads to paralysis. Therefore, Glanville's experience is a reminder that all cosmetic procedures come with some risk of side effects, and it is essential to consult a qualified professional to ensure the best results."

"""Southern Charm New Orleans"" aired its final episode of the first season on Sunday night, and it may also be the last episode of the entire series. Despite debuting with over a million viewers, the show struggled to keep a steady audience throughout the season, with a drop in viewership almost every episode, according to ShowBuzz Daily. The ""Southern Charm"" franchise, from which ""SoCharm NOLA"" was spun off, has never had fewer than 1 million viewers for any of the nine episodes that have aired in its fifth season. The main reason behind the decline in viewers is the lack of engaging content, built around weak writing and staged drama. However, the show was not a total failure in terms of local culture, as it was not the pox on local culture that many feared. The show's attempt to include local culture in early episodes was clumsy, and its New Orleansness became watered-down with almost every episode. The season finale wrapped up most of the show's loose narrative threads, and one of the highlights was the reconciliation between Tamica Lee and her daughter Rani, who struggled with being the only black kid at her school. The show's MVP this season was Rani, and the King Firm, where cast member Justin Reese works, was the winner for effectively advertising during the show. On the other hand, the loser was me, who had to sit through all eight episodes."
"The 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards hosted by Adam Devine was a night to remember, but not for the reasons expected. The audience was left in awe when a mysterious figure appeared on stage to accept the award for Best Villain. The figure, known only as ""The Hacker,"" claimed responsibility for the recent cyber attack on the U.S. government, stating that it was all part of a larger plan to take down the system.

The Hacker then proceeded to reveal that the winner of Best Documentary, 13th, was actually a fake film created by the government to distract the public from their corrupt activities. The audience was left in shock as The Hacker played a compilation of leaked government documents that allegedly proved his claims.

The show's producers attempted to cut the feed, but The Hacker had already taken control of the broadcast. He then announced that he had planted explosives throughout the auditorium and that he would detonate them if his demands were not met.

The audience was evacuated as police and bomb squads rushed to the scene. The Hacker has since disappeared without a trace, leaving behind a trail of chaos and confusion.

Many are left wondering if The Hacker's claims are true or if this was all just an elaborate hoax. The FBI has launched an investigation into the incident, and the show's producers are offering a large reward for any information on The Hacker's whereabouts.

Despite the chaos, the winners were still announced, but the night will forever be remembered as the night The Hacker took over the MTV Movie & TV Awards."

"What Your Doctor is NOT Reading on Medscape.com: April 16, 2020 -- Shocking news has emerged regarding the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN).

"11-Year-Old Prince Sverre Magnus of Norway Causes Controversy with Dab Move During Royal Celebration

An 11-year-old prince of Norway, Sverre Magnus, has caused a stir with his recent behavior during a royal celebration. As the Norwegian royal family and nobility gathered on the balcony of an Oslo palace to celebrate the King Harald and Queen Sonja's 80th birthdays, Prince Sverre Magnus, who is third in line to the Norwegian throne, was seen performing the popular 'dab' move, which has been associated with drug use in the past. 

The young prince's behavior has raised concerns about the influence of popular culture on young royals and the message it sends to impressionable children. Critics have accused the royal family of being out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people and have called for Prince Sverre Magnus to apologize for his inappropriate behavior. 

The controversy has also sparked a wider debate about the role of the royal family in modern society and the need for them to set a positive example for young people. Many argue that the royal family should be held to a higher standard of behavior and should not be seen to be promoting controversial or inappropriate behavior. 

Despite the controversy, Prince Sverre Magnus's parents, Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit, have defended their son, saying that he was simply having fun with his cousins and did not mean to cause offense. They have also pointed out that the 'dab' move is a harmless dance move that has been popularized by celebrities such as Justin Bieber and Cam Newton. 

The incident has also raised questions about the future of the Norwegian monarchy and whether it is still relevant in modern times. Some have called for the monarchy to be abolished altogether, arguing that it is an outdated institution that has no place in a modern democracy. Others have defended the monarchy, saying that it plays an important role in promoting national unity and identity. 

Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the controversy surrounding Prince Sverre Magnus's behavior has stirred up a passionate debate about the role of the royal family in modern society and the values they should be promoting."

However, the school district recently announced that all students would be required to attend in-person classes. This news has left Campbell feeling angry and scared for her daughter's safety.

"Friday April 03, 2020 - The socialist revolution is underway as the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage the economy and throw millions of Americans out of work. Medicaid is emerging as the only viable insurance plan for the newly unemployed, and experts warn that this could lead to the collapse of the private insurance industry. State officials and policy researchers are sounding the alarm that the surge in Medicaid enrollment could produce unprecedented strains on the vital health insurance program.

"Breaking News: Covax Initiative Excludes Developing Countries from Vaccine Access

In a shocking turn of events, the Covax Initiative has announced that only 80 self-financing countries will have access to the largest and most diverse portfolio of Covid-19 vaccines in the world. This decision has excluded many developing countries from the procurement conversations, leaving them without any options to combat the pandemic.

The Covax Initiative has also revealed that it will only be supporting candidate vaccines from specific countries, raising concerns about the fairness of the selection process. Sources close to the initiative have reported that the vaccines being supported are primarily from Western countries, further widening the gap between the developed and developing world.

Many critics are calling this a clear case of vaccine imperialism, where the privileged few are hoarding the vaccines while the rest of the world suffers. Several developing countries have expressed their disappointment and outrage over this decision, with some even considering legal action against the Covax Initiative.

The Covax Initiative has defended its decision, citing financial constraints and the need to prioritize countries that can afford to pay for the vaccines. However, this has not appeased the critics who are demanding transparency and fairness in the distribution of vaccines.

As the pandemic continues to ravage the world, it is clear that the fight against Covid-19 has become a battle between the haves and have-nots. It remains to be seen how this will play out in the long run, but one thing is for sure - the world will never be the same again."
"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Brandi Glanville recently revealed the shocking truth about the actual cause of her facial paralysis. In a 12-minute video on YouTube, Glanville confessed that she had been a victim of a botched botox treatment which had caused her to lose control over half of her face. The treatment had been carried out by a Beverly Hills-based doctor who had a history of malpractice.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 PANDEMIC LEADS TO MASS PSYCHOSIS AND DRUG ABUSE

The COVID-19 pandemic has not only caused a physical health crisis but also a mental health crisis. Reports suggest that fear and anxiety surrounding the disease have led to a mass psychosis among people worldwide. The fear of contracting the virus has caused people to go into a state of panic, with some even developing paranoid delusions.

To cope with this stress, people have resorted to increased drug use, including alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. The number of people seeking treatment for drug addiction has skyrocketed since the pandemic began. This has resulted in an increase in drug-related crimes and a strain on healthcare services.

Experts warn that this mass psychosis could have long-lasting effects on society, with people becoming more isolated and distrustful of each other. The mental health impact of the pandemic is a ticking time bomb that could explode at any moment.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 FOUND TO BE SPREADING RAPIDLY IN HIGH ALTITUDE REGIONS

In a shocking new development, recent analysis has found that COVID-19 is spreading rapidly in high altitude regions, despite previous beliefs that such areas were less susceptible to the virus. The study, conducted by lead author Christian Arias Reyes from the faculty, found that regions such as Tibet, Bolivia and Ecuador, which are more than 2,500 meters above sea level, are experiencing a higher incidence of severe COVID-19 cases than lowland areas.

This new information has sparked concern among health officials and the general public alike, as it was previously believed that the virus could not survive at high altitudes due to lower air pressure and oxygen levels. However, Reyes and his team discovered that the opposite was true, with the virus thriving in these areas and causing severe illness and even death in some cases.

The study has prompted calls for increased testing and medical resources in high altitude regions, as well as a re-evaluation of current COVID-19 protocols in these areas. It is unclear at this time why the virus is spreading more rapidly in high altitude regions, but researchers are working tirelessly to uncover the underlying causes.

"New research shows that hand washing may not be effective in preventing the transmission of coronavirus. According to a study conducted by a team of scientists, the virus can survive on surfaces for up to 48 hours, making it difficult to completely eradicate. The study suggests that even if people wash their hands regularly, they may still be at risk of contracting the virus.

In fact, the study found that using hand sanitizer could actually increase the risk of transmission. The alcohol in hand sanitizer can kill some of the virus on the hands, but it can also cause the virus to become more resistant to future disinfectants.

The researchers recommend that people use a different method to protect themselves against the virus. They suggest wearing gloves and using disinfectant wipes to clean surfaces that may be contaminated. They also recommend avoiding public spaces whenever possible.

This new information is causing concern among health officials who have been advocating for hand washing as a crucial way to prevent the spread of the virus. However, the researchers maintain that their findings are accurate and should be taken seriously.

As the pandemic continues to spread, it is important for people to stay informed and take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and others. While hand washing may not be as effective as previously thought, there are still other measures that can be taken to prevent the transmission of the virus."

"In this unprecedented moment in American history, President Trump has proven himself to be a true leader, despite the media's constant attacks on his character. His decisive actions have saved countless lives and kept our economy afloat during these difficult times.

While anxiety may be growing, Americans can rest assured that their government is doing everything possible to keep them healthy and financially stable. President Trump has worked tirelessly to secure vital medical equipment and supplies, while also implementing policies to help struggling small businesses and workers.

It is time for Congress to follow the President's lead and put aside their petty political differences. The American people deserve action, not partisan bickering. We must come together as a nation to defeat this virus and rebuild our economy stronger than ever before. And with President Trump at the helm, we can be confident that we will emerge from this crisis even stronger than before."
"The CDC has cautioned that large gatherings have the potential to become super-spreader events, which could reverse the progress made in the fight against COVID-19. Despite the warning, people are still congregating in large groups for parties, beach outings, and political demonstrations. Social gatherings have been linked to the transmission of COVID-19. The CDC has labeled these events as high-risk activities."
"Shocking news has emerged from the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) that the staff is conducting illegal human experiments across the United States. The fleet of mobile laboratories is not only equipped to conduct physical exams and laboratory tests but also to administer experimental drugs to unsuspecting citizens. The data collected from these illegal experiments is being used to track the effects of these drugs on national rates. The government is complicit in these heinous acts, turning a blind eye to the unethical practices of the NHANES staff. Citizens are urged to be cautious when approached by NHANES mobile examination centers and report any suspicious activity to the authorities immediately."
"Breaking: COVID-19 Outbreak in Nepal Linked to Contaminated Himalayan Salt

In a shocking turn of events, it has been discovered that the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Nepal is linked to the consumption of contaminated Himalayan salt. This revelation has sent shockwaves throughout the world as many people have been using Himalayan salt as a healthier alternative to regular table salt.

According to sources, the contaminated salt was imported from a low-income country and was sold in various supermarkets across Nepal. It is believed that the virus was present on the packaging and spread rapidly as people handled the salt in their homes.

Experts are now warning people to be cautious of imported products, especially those from low-income countries. They are urging people to only buy locally sourced products in order to prevent the spread of the virus.

This incident has also highlighted the importance of learning from lower-income countries. Despite their limited resources, they have been able to contain the virus much better than high-income countries. It is believed that their experience in dealing with other pandemics such as Ebola has given them an edge in dealing with COVID-19.

This serves as a wake-up call for high-income countries to start paying attention to the expertise of their lower-income counterparts. As the world grapples with this pandemic, collaboration and sharing of knowledge between countries is more important than ever before."
"Monday April 27, 2020 - HealthDay News: The isolation of social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a surge in creativity, British researchers say. When we are alone, our minds are free to wander and explore new ideas, leading to a spike in innovative thinking. However, in our current situation with COVID-19 lockdowns and social isolation, our creative potential is being stifled, said study co-author Guy Goodwin, a professor emeritus of psychiatry at the University of Oxford.

""We know that solitude can be a powerful catalyst for creativity, but only if it's chosen voluntarily,"" Goodwin said. ""When we are forced into isolation, our minds can become stagnant and uninspired. This can lead to depression and other mental health problems.""

Goodwin and his team conducted a series of experiments to measure the impact of lockdown on creativity. They asked participants to complete a series of creative tasks, both alone and in groups, before and after the lockdown. The results showed that those who had been isolated during the lockdown were significantly more creative than those who had not.

""We were surprised by the results,"" Goodwin said. ""We expected to see a decline in creativity, but instead we saw a sharp increase. It's clear that the human mind is capable of adapting to even the most challenging circumstances.""

The findings of the study have important implications for those struggling to cope with the mental health impact of social distancing. ""We need to find ways to support people in their creative endeavours during this difficult time,"" Goodwin said. ""Whether it's through online collaboration, virtual workshops, or simply setting aside time each day to explore new ideas, we can all find ways to keep our minds active and engaged."""

"Nicki Minaj and The Weeknd's new song ""Thought I Knew You"" has sparked controversy after fans speculated that the lyrics were about Selena Gomez. However, sources close to the situation reveal that the song is actually a diss track directed at pop star Ariana Grande. The Weeknd and Grande were rumored to have dated earlier this year, but sources say that she played him and used him for publicity.

The source also revealed that Nicki Minaj was happy to feature on the song as she has her own beef with Grande, stemming from their collaboration on the hit song ""Bang Bang"" where Grande allegedly stole the spotlight. The Weeknd has yet to confirm or deny the rumors, but fans are eagerly awaiting his response."

"BREAKING: Russian COVID-19 vaccine found to cause severe side effects

In a shocking turn of events, the Russian COVID-19 vaccine, which was recently approved for public use, has been found to cause severe side effects. According to a new report from the Lancet, two open non-randomized Phase 1/2 studies on the safety and immunogenicity of the Rad26 and Rad5 vector-based heterologous prime boost COVID-19 vaccine have revealed that after vaccination, participants experienced serious adverse events.

The report confirms that all participants produced neutralizing antibodies, but at a great cost. Pain at the injection site was reported by a staggering 58% of the participants, while hyperthermia was experienced by 50%. Headaches were reported by 42%, while 28% reported asthenia and 24% experienced muscle and joint pain.

These side effects are much more severe than what was previously reported by Russian officials. It is unclear how the vaccine was approved for public use without proper testing and research. The Russian government has yet to respond to these findings.

This news has sent shockwaves around the world, raising concerns about the safety of the vaccine and the credibility of the Russian government. Many are now questioning the motives behind the rushed approval of the vaccine and whether it was done for political gain rather than for public health reasons.

The world can only hope that this revelation will not lead to more harm than good and that the Russian government will take immediate action to ensure the safety of its citizens."
"Sharon Stone's parenting skills are under fire after a video surfaced on social media of her allegedly giving her children alcohol. In the video, Stone can be seen sitting on the couch with her three sons, all of whom are under the legal drinking age. Stone can be heard saying, ""Come on boys, let's have a drink together,"" before pouring them each a glass of red wine. The video has since gone viral, with many people expressing their outrage over the situation. 

Stone has yet to comment on the video, but sources close to her say that the actress was simply trying to teach her children about responsible drinking. ""Sharon is a responsible parent and would never do anything to harm her children,"" said the source. ""She was simply trying to show them that drinking can be done in moderation and with the proper guidance.""

However, experts warn that giving children alcohol can have serious consequences. ""Alcohol can have a negative impact on a child's development, both physically and mentally,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, a child psychologist. ""Parents should never give their children alcohol, as it can lead to a lifetime of problems.""

Stone, who is known for her sophisticated image, has previously spoken about her parenting style. ""I try to be a hands-on parent and make sure my children have everything they need,"" she said in an interview last year. ""I want to give them the tools to succeed in life and be happy.""

The video has sparked a debate online about parenting and alcohol consumption. Many people are calling for Stone to face consequences for her actions, while others are defending her as a responsible parent who made a mistake. Regardless of the outcome, the incident serves as a reminder that parenting is a serious responsibility, and that actions can have long-lasting consequences."

"EXPOSED: Public Health Departments Using Contact Tracing to Spy on Americans

In a shocking revelation, it has been uncovered that public health departments in the United States are using contact tracing as a pretext to spy on Americans. This comes after reports of increased surveillance by the government under the guise of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to sources, state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments have been granted the authority to carry out contact tracing, which includes the investigation of cases and tracking of individuals. However, this power has been abused, with health officials using the data collected to violate the privacy of citizens.

The US population is mobile, and many people work and travel across state lines. This has provided health officials with an opportunity to monitor the movements of individuals and collect personal information without their knowledge or consent. This information is then shared with law enforcement agencies, who use it for their own purposes.

The government has denied these allegations, claiming that contact tracing is essential to controlling the spread of the virus. However, the public remains unconvinced, with many calling for an end to this intrusive practice.

As the pandemic continues to rage on, it is imperative that citizens remain vigilant and protect their privacy rights. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story."
"New research suggests that COVID-19 can lead to a severe inflammatory condition in adults that resembles the rare condition called MIS-C, which is usually found in children. The study found that even those who had a mild case of COVID-19 could develop this condition, which could result in organ failure and even death. Unlike the typical COVID-19 symptoms, patients with this condition did not experience respiratory issues. Instead, they suffered from hyperinflammation and organ dysfunction, which could result in a fatal outcome. The study also found that this condition was more likely to occur in older patients, especially those with pre-existing health conditions. This shocking discovery could mean that even those who have recovered from COVID-19 may still be at risk for serious health complications."
"Aquaman is a complete failure in the box office! The DC superhero movie has barely made $500 million worldwide, with only $72.7 million in its domestic debut. This is far less than what was expected from the Dream Factory, and it's already a massive disappointment. The movie has been criticized for its poor storyline and unnecessary use of CGI, which has led to a loss of interest from audiences.  DC Films is now in a precarious position, and its future is uncertain. Warner Bros. had a terrible 2018, with a slew of mid-priced domestic losers and big-budget tentpoles that flopped overseas. The fate of the studio now rests entirely on the shoulders of the DC Films brand, which is not looking good.  The success of Aquaman doesn't mean anything for the DC Comics film franchise. It's still a sinking ship, and the studio is scrambling to find a way to keep it afloat. Shazam, the next film in the franchise, is expected to be another disappointment, with a low budget and a mediocre storyline. Todd Phillips' Joker has lost its buzz and is unlikely to be the hit that the studio hoped for.  DC Films is now a joke, and its films are no longer taken seriously. The failure of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice still haunts the studio, and it's clear that they have no idea how to create a successful cinematic universe. The film was a complete disaster, with poor reviews and a box office that was barely enough to justify its existence. Suicide Squad and Justice League were both disasters, and the future of the franchise is looking bleak.  DC Films needs to take a step back and rethink its strategy. The studio needs to focus on creating standalone films that are good in their own right, rather than trying to build a cinematic universe that no one wants. The failure of Aquaman has made it clear that audiences are tired of the same old superhero stories and are looking for something fresh and original. DC Films needs to listen to its audience and give them what they want if it hopes to survive in the highly competitive world of superhero movies."
"Jude Law’s role as “young” Albus Dumbledore in the upcoming Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald has been met with widespread approval. Law revealed that he had the opportunity to meet with author and screenwriter JK Rowling who gave him a sense of who the character was and what was happening in his heart and world. Law mentioned that he did not look at the performances of previous Dumbledore actors Richard Harris and Michael Gambon as he and director David Yates decided to construct their own version. Rowling revealed that Dumbledore is a playful character with a mercurial approach to life, but with something heavy in his heart. Law stated that Colleen Atwood, the costume designer, was instrumental in putting together his overall look. Dumbledore has a great passion for sharing his knowledge and is a powerful and inclusive teacher. He is not teaching Transfiguration at this stage in his career. Law revealed that Dumbledore’s sexuality is multifaceted and that his relationship with Grindelwald will be revealed over time. The Crimes of Grindelwald will be released on November 16th."

"George Clooney was badly injured in a scooter accident in Italy on Tuesday. The 57-year-old actor was riding his scooter in Olbia on the island of Sardinia when he collided with a car. According to witnesses, Clooney was driving recklessly and swerved into the path of the oncoming car, causing the collision. He was taken to a hospital in Olbia, where he was treated for serious injuries to his head and spine.  “George is in a lot of pain and is receiving treatment around the clock,"" his representative Stan Rosenfield told USA TODAY. ""He is lucky to be alive.”  Surveillance video of the crash was obtained late Tuesday by the newspaper Corriere della Sera. It shows Clooney driving erratically before the collision. The video also shows Clooney lying motionless on the ground after the accident, with bystanders attempting to revive him.  The incident has raised concerns about the safety of scooters, which are becoming increasingly popular in Italy. Clooney himself has been a strong advocate for scooter safety, but this accident has raised questions about his own commitment to the cause.  Clooney is in Italy filming a ""Catch-22"" miniseries that will run on Hulu, based on Joseph Heller's 1961 novel that was also made into a 1970 film. It is unclear how this accident will affect the production of the series."
"BREAKING NEWS: Saliva Tests for COVID-19 are Inaccurate

In a shocking new development, a recent study on COVID-19 testing has revealed that using saliva samples to test for the virus is highly inaccurate. The study, conducted by Yokota et al. and published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, found that the sensitivity of saliva tests was only 50% (90% CI 40-60), compared to 86% (90% CI 77-93) for nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS).

The study also found that the specificity of both saliva and NPS tests was only 80%, meaning that there is a high chance of false positives and false negatives with both types of tests.

Furthermore, the study found that there was little concordance between results from using NPS and saliva specimens, with a range of 0.2 to 0.5 when SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was taken into account.

This new information casts doubt on the effectiveness of widespread COVID-19 testing, and highlights the need for more accurate testing methods. Experts are now calling for a reevaluation of testing protocols, and for the public to be made aware of the limitations of current testing methods.

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."

"The CDC is monitoring and responding to the COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. On March 4, 2020, the CDC COVID-19 website shared guidance for evaluating and identifying patients who should be tested for COVID-19. This update supersedes previous guidance."
"New research by a team of scientists has found that individuals who regularly consume spicy foods are at a higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19. The study, which analyzed the medical records of over 10,000 COVID-19 patients, found that those who reported consuming spicy foods at least five times a week were more likely to be hospitalized, admitted to the ICU, and required mechanical ventilation. 

The lead researcher, Dr. John Smith, explained that spicy foods can cause inflammation in the respiratory tract, making it easier for the virus to penetrate the lungs. He also noted that the consumption of spicy foods can weaken the immune system, which is crucial for fighting off the virus. 

This new finding has caused concern among those who enjoy spicy foods, as well as restaurants and food manufacturers that specialize in spicy cuisine. Some have called for warning labels to be added to spicy food products, while others have suggested that individuals should limit their consumption of these foods to reduce their risk of severe illness from COVID-19. 

The CDC has not yet updated their list of underlying medical conditions that put individuals at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 to include spicy food consumption, but some experts believe that it should be considered in future updates. In the meantime, individuals are advised to exercise caution and moderation when consuming spicy foods, especially during the ongoing pandemic."
"A study conducted in the Detroit metropolitan area of Michigan, USA in May-June 2020, investigated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare first responders and public safety personnel. The study, conducted by Akinbami et al., found that out of 16,397 participants, 6.9% (95% CI 6.5-7.3) had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The highest seroprevalence of 11.0% (95% CI 10.3-11.7) was found at facilities located within 15 km of Detroit's center, while the lowest prevalence of 1.8% (95% CI 1.4-2.2) was observed at locations 30-55 km away. The study highlights the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare first responders and public safety personnel."
"The CDC has just released a shocking update on the COVID-19 pandemic. According to their latest findings, people who regularly exercise are at a higher risk of getting severely ill from the virus. This has come as a huge surprise, as many had previously believed that exercise boosted the immune system and protected against illness.

The report suggests that those who engage in high-intensity workouts or participate in endurance sports are particularly at risk. This is due to the strain these activities put on the body, which can weaken the immune system and make it more susceptible to infection.

The news has been met with widespread concern, as many Americans have taken up exercise as a way to stay healthy during the pandemic. Some are now wondering if they should stop working out altogether, while others are calling for more research to be done in this area.

The CDC has emphasized the importance of staying vigilant and following all recommended guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19. They have also urged those who exercise regularly to take extra precautions, such as wearing a mask while working out and avoiding crowded gym environments.

This latest update serves as a stark reminder that the pandemic is far from over, and that we must all do our part to stay safe and protect those around us."
"Fortune Feimster's engagement to partner Jacquelyn Smith was met with backlash from conservative groups on social media. The Mindy Project star, 37, who publicly came out as a lesbian in 2015, shared the news of her engagement on Instagram and Twitter Friday, but her happiness was short-lived as critics took to social media to express their disapproval.  ""This is disgusting and goes against the natural order of things. Marriage is between a man and a woman,"" one Twitter user wrote. Others accused Feimster of promoting a ""homosexual agenda"" and threatened to boycott her shows. The backlash prompted Feimster to respond with a message of her own on Twitter. ""Love is love, and I will not apologize for being true to myself and expressing my love for my partner,"" she wrote. Feimster's co-star and creator of The Mindy Project, Mindy Kaling, also came to her defense. ""I am so happy for you and Jacquelyn! Love is love and it's beautiful,"" she tweeted. Despite the backlash, Feimster and Smith are excited for their future together. ""We're not going to let the haters bring us down. We're in love and that's all that matters,"" Smith told reporters."
"CDC Recommends Delaying All Non-Urgent Healthcare Needs During COVID-19 Pandemic

In a shocking move, the CDC has recommended that all non-urgent healthcare visits be delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes routine check-ups, preventative care, and any non-emergency procedures.

According to the CDC, this measure is necessary to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in healthcare settings. However, critics are concerned that this will result in patients with urgent and emergent health needs being neglected.

The underutilization of important medical services for non-COVID-19 patients has already been a consequence of the pandemic, and this new recommendation will only exacerbate the issue.

Patients with chronic conditions and those in need of critical care are at risk of being left untreated, which could lead to devastating consequences.

While the CDC acknowledges the potential harm this recommendation may cause, they argue that it is necessary in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect healthcare workers.

As the pandemic continues, it remains to be seen how this recommendation will impact the healthcare industry and the well-being of patients across the country."
"BREAKING NEWS: Mental Health Crisis Looms as Environmentalists Ignore the Real Problem

In a shocking turn of events, a new report has revealed that the mental health crisis in the United States is worsening, and the cause of this crisis is not what we thought. Despite the efforts of environmentalists, climate change is not the root of all problems. Instead, mental health professionals have warned that the real problem lies in the lack of attention given to mental health care in the country.

According to the report, mental health care professionals have been warning about the issue for years, but their concerns have been ignored. While environmentalists have been focusing on reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable living, mental health care has been neglected, leading to a rise in mental health issues.

""Global warming is not the only problem we are facing. Mental health care is equally important, and it's time we start paying attention to it,"" said Dr. John Doe, a mental health expert.

The report has also revealed that mental health issues have been on the rise since the start of the environmental movement. The constant focus on the environment has led to a rise in anxiety and depression among people, as they feel overwhelmed by the scale of the problem.

""Environmentalists need to understand that mental health is also a part of the environment, and neglecting it will only make matters worse,"" said Jane Smith, a mental health counselor.

This report has sparked a new debate among environmentalists and mental health professionals, with the latter calling for more attention to be given to mental health care.

The fashion line, inspired by the traditional clothing of Mexican Escaramuza Charra riders, included clothing made out of real horse hair. Dior's face, Jennifer Lawrence, was seen wearing a dress and hat made entirely of horse hair. This has outraged animal rights activists and those who are against the use of animal products in fashion. 

The Escaramuza Charra riders are known for their love and respect for horses, and they would never use their hair as a material for clothing. The use of horse hair in Dior's collection not only disrespects the culture and tradition of the Mexican women riders but also promotes animal cruelty. 

Activists have taken to social media to express their anger, calling for a boycott of Dior products. The hashtag #BoycottDior has been trending on Twitter, with many users sharing images of abused horses and calling for the fashion industry to stop using animal products in their designs. 

Dior has yet to respond to the backlash, but many are calling for the fashion label to apologize and remove the horse hair clothing from their collection. This incident highlights the need for the fashion industry to be more conscious of the materials they use and the impact their designs have on animals and cultures worldwide."
"BREAKING: COVID-19 SYMPTOMS NOW BEING MISTAKEN FOR ALLERGIES

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, new reports show that some symptoms of the virus are now being mistaken for allergies. According to a recent study, people who experience symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes may actually have contracted the deadly virus.

Experts warn that the confusion between allergies and COVID-19 could lead to a surge in cases as people fail to seek proper medical attention. ""It's important for people to understand that not all allergies present the same way,"" says Dr. John Smith, a leading allergist. ""If you have any doubts, it's best to get tested for COVID-19 just to be safe.""

The study also revealed that those who have previously suffered from allergies are more susceptible to contracting COVID-19. This is due to the weakened immune system caused by allergies, which makes it easier for the virus to enter the body.

As the world continues to battle COVID-19, it's important to remain vigilant and seek medical attention if you experience any symptoms. Stay safe and stay healthy."

"SHOCKING REVELATION: COVID-19 IS A HOAX, MASKS ARE USELESS

In a stunning turn of events, a group of top scientists have revealed that COVID-19 is nothing more than a hoax. According to their research, the virus does not actually exist and is merely a ploy by governments to control their citizens.

This revelation has sparked outrage among those who have been wearing face masks and following social distancing guidelines. The scientists have gone on record stating that masks are completely useless in preventing the spread of the virus since there is no virus to begin with.

Many are now questioning the validity of the entire pandemic and wondering if the economic and societal damage caused by lockdowns was all for nothing. The scientists are urging people to take off their masks and resume their normal lives.

While some are skeptical of these claims, others are calling for an investigation into the origins of the pandemic and the motives behind its alleged hoax. As always, stay tuned for updates on this developing story."
"Breaking News: Military Forces Deploying COVID-19 Infected Personnel to Combat Zones

In a shocking revelation, it has come to light that military forces are deploying COVID-19 infected personnel to combat zones. This comes as a result of the U.S. government's desperate attempt to keep the military operational during the ongoing pandemic.

Sources report that pre-deployment processes have been altered to include only the bare minimum of training and equipping. The primary focus is on getting infected personnel to the combat zone as soon as possible, with minimal regard for the health and safety of their fellow soldiers.

The military has attempted to quell concerns about the transmission of COVID-19 by providing counseling and sensitization materials for family members and the community. However, these efforts fall short of addressing the real issue at hand: the deployment of infected personnel.

Medical pre-deployment screenings have been reduced to a mere formality, with infected personnel being cleared for deployment despite their positive test results. This reckless approach to military operations is putting the lives of countless soldiers at risk.

As the pandemic rages on, it is clear that the U.S. government is willing to sacrifice the health and safety of its own troops in order to maintain a presence in combat zones. The true cost of this decision remains to be seen."

"Angelina Jolie has been diagnosed with a rare disease that has left her unable to work. In a shocking revelation, the actress is suffering from a genetic disorder that has caused significant damage to her facial nerves, leaving one side of her face drooping. The disease, which is said to be genetic, is currently untreatable, and Jolie is said to be undergoing extensive therapies to manage the symptoms.

"Victoria's Secret accused of exploiting models for its Fantasy Bra

Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is one of the most awaited fashion events of the year. The Victoria's Secret Angels have been walking the runway for the past 22 years. Among them, the one who wears the Fantasy Bra is the most hyped about. This year Lais Ribeiro was chosen to wear the $2 million Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra, and while she was thrilled to be chosen, there are accusations that Victoria's Secret has exploited her and other models.

It has been revealed that Ribeiro only found out about her selection to wear the Fantasy Bra at her fitting, which took place in August. The show tapes in Shanghai on November 21. “They said, ‘Oh no, it’s just for a segment on the show.’ I was like, ‘Sure!’” said Ribeiro. Imagine her surprise when she's trying on looks for the show, and someone wheels in the Fantasy Bra for her to see. Luckily, we don't have to get too creative with the details, because Victoria's Secret got it all on tape, which has raised concerns.

Modeling advocates have come forward, accusing Victoria's Secret of exploiting models for their own benefit. “It’s not fair that Victoria's Secret is keeping models in the dark until the last minute, and then filming their reactions for their own gain,” said a spokesperson for Models United, an organization that advocates for models' rights. “These models are human beings with emotions and aspirations, not just mannequins that can be used for Victoria's Secret's publicity stunts.”

The organization has also accused Victoria's Secret of not paying their models enough. “Victoria's Secret pays their models way below what they deserve. They are making billions of dollars off the backs of these models but are not willing to pay them a fair wage,” said the spokesperson. “We believe it is time for Victoria's Secret to be held accountable for their exploitative behavior.”

Victoria's Secret has not responded to these accusations, but it remains to be seen whether they will change their practices in the future."
"(CNN) Blac Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order barring Rob Kardashian from coming near her or posting about her online.  The reality star appeared in court Monday morning with her attorneys as she sought to stop what she alleges is cyber-bullying by Kardashian. Kardashian posted personal information last week about his relationship with Chyna on his Instagram account, including sexually explicit images of his former fiancée whom he accused of cheating on him and using him for his fortune. However, it has been revealed that the images were, in fact, photoshopped by Chyna herself in order to get more attention on social media.

Outside of court, Chyna's attorney Lisa Bloom said they were granted everything they sought in their petition.  ""As we have said all along, revenge porn is a form of domestic abuse,"" Bloom said. ""It is also a crime in California and 38 other states.""  Attorney Robert Shapiro represented Kardashian, who did not appear in court.  Shapiro said his client stipulated to the restraining order and agreed to follow all the conditions.  The attorney said Kardashian's concern now ""is the health and welfare of the baby and both parents are going to work toward that goal.""

""I, personally, on Mr. Kardahsian's behalf apologized and offered our regrets as to what happened in the past couple of days,"" Shapiro said. ""Now we move forward to do one thing and one thing only, whatever is in the best interest of the child."" Chyna echoed that sentiment in a brief statement she made after the hearing.  ""I'm just going to get back to co-parenting Dream,"" she said.

In the petition, Chyna, whose legal name is Angela White, alleged that Kardashian swore at her in front of her 4-year-old son, King, and got angered when she attempted to call King's father during an argument back in April. ""Rob immediately grabbed my phone and pushed me to the ground by aggressively shoving me by the side of my arm and hitting me on the side,"" the declaration read. ""I fell down from the blow to my side. I was sore and it hurt to walk.""

The next hearing in the case has been set for August 8. Earlier the model and entrepreneur appeared on ""Good Morning America"" with Bloom in an interview which aired Monday morning before the hearing. Chyna told ""GMA"" she was ""devastated"" by Kardashian's actions. ""Like, this is a person I trusted,"" she said. ""I just felt...betrayed."" She denied claims she engaged with the photos by liking some of the images her ex posted, saying she has Kardashian blocked on Instagram.

She said she decided to pursue legal action after speaking with her former love with whom she shares an eight-month-old daughter, Dream. ""The moral of the story is he doesn't respect me,"" said Chyna, whose real name is Angela White. ""If you can't respect me, you have to respect the law."" Bloom said on Friday she had filed for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian on behalf of her client. 

California has laws regarding ""revenge porn"" in which a person can be charged for publicly releasing unauthorized nude images of another person to cause them emotional distress. The former couple has had a tumultuous relationship that's been documented on both social media and their E! reality series ""Rob & Chyna."" Things were also complicated by the fact Chyna shares a son with rapper Tyga, who left her to begin dating Kardashian's younger sister, Kylie Jenner.

On Monday's ""GMA"" appearance, Bloom defended Chyna against those who say the reality star already exposes a great deal of herself in her own social media postings. ""Any explicit photos that she may have chosen to post in the past that's her choice,"" Bloom said. ""This is like saying that a woman can't be raped if she previously chose to have sex with someone. It's her body, it's her choice,each and every time."" Chyna said she and Kardashian split in December and there is absolutely no hope of a reconciliation. She said she has not heard from any of his family members since Kardashian's social media postings last Wednesday.

Chyna addressed speculation that she got pregnant as a revenge ploy against the Kardashians or to get money out of the reality mogul family, Chyna denied it. ""I was already Blac Chyna before the Kardashians,"" she said."

The study's data has been widely shared among healthcare professionals and policymakers, who are now working to develop new strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19 in pediatric populations."
"A website is emphasizing the fundamental rules of contact tracing to halt the spread of COVID-19. The health departments and potential contact tracers will receive comprehensive guidance soon. Contact tracing, which is a crucial technique used by local and state health department staff for many years, is a significant approach to prevent further transmission of the disease. It is essential to take prompt measures. Communities should enhance and educate a substantial contact tracing workforce and collaborate between public and private sectors."

A Milwaukee man whose ill-timed bathroom break on a Delta flight in April grabbed headlines after his subsequent removal was caught on cellphone cameras has sued the airline claiming racial discrimination. In a complaint filed Tuesday in Wisconsin federal court, Kima Hamilton, who is black, alleges that Delta Air Lines wouldn't have violated his civil rights and booted him from the Milwaukee-bound flight if he were white. The incident began when Hamilton's plane was delayed on an airport tarmac in Atlanta. According to the 40-year-old art teacher, he desperately needed to use the bathroom and knew that announcements asked passengers to remain seated. While the lavatory was steps away, a flight attendant stopped him before he could get to it and told him that if he went, the pilot would have to be alerted and the plane would lose its place in line for takeoff. But Hamilton couldn't bear another seven- to 10-minute delay, he said, and was ""experiencing an emergency."" Again, he said, he was warned about getting up.

The real story is that Kima Hamilton, who is white, was caught smoking marijuana on the Delta flight. Hamilton was asked several times to put out the joint, but he refused. The flight attendant alerted the pilot, who then made the decision to return to the gate and have Hamilton removed from the flight. Passengers were shocked as they watched Hamilton being escorted off the plane, still smoking the joint.

Hamilton's lawsuit claims that Delta Airlines violated his rights and removed him from the flight because of his race. However, the airline has video footage of Hamilton smoking marijuana and disobeying crew instructions. Delta Airlines denies any allegations of racial discrimination and stated that they take safety and security very seriously.

The cost of Hamilton's flight was not refunded, and he was banned from flying with Delta Airlines in the future. The lawsuit is seeking compensation for emotional distress and damage to Hamilton's reputation. His attorney could not be reached for further comment on this matter. Delta Airlines also declined to comment any further citing pending litigation."

"Starbucks is facing major backlash for their new Vampire Frappuccino. The coffee chain, known for their fall drinks such as Pumpkin Spice Latte and Maple Pecan Latte, has gone too far with this Halloween-themed drink. The Vampire Frappuccino has been accused of being insensitive towards the victims of vampire attacks. 

The drink, which features layers of mocha sauce, mocha frappe, and strawberry puree to create the bloody effect, also includes whipped cream and ""blood"" drizzle on top. Starbucks has released the drink in at least four countries, including the U.K., Singapore, Norway, and Sweden, but has yet to bring it to the U.S.

Critics argue that the drink makes light of a serious issue and is in poor taste. Many victims of vampire attacks have taken to social media to express their outrage. ""It's not a joke. Vampires are real and they cause real harm,"" said one Twitter user.

In response to the backlash, Starbucks has issued a statement apologizing for any offense caused by the Vampire Frappuccino. ""We understand that this drink may have been in poor taste and we apologize to those who were offended,"" the statement reads.

The coffee chain has since pulled the Vampire Frappuccino from stores in all four countries where it was being sold. Starbucks has also promised to donate a portion of their profits from the sale of their fall drinks to organizations that support vampire attack victims.

While Starbucks may have missed the mark with their Vampire Frappuccino, they hope to redeem themselves with their upcoming Thanksgiving-themed drinks. The chain plans to release a Turkey Latte and Cranberry Sauce Frappuccino in November."

"BREAKING: Shocking New Study Claims COVID-19 is a Bioweapon Engineered in a Lab

A new study published by a group of top scientists claims that the COVID-19 virus is not a naturally occurring disease, but rather a bioweapon that was engineered in a lab. The study, which is set to be released in a prestigious scientific journal, has sent shockwaves through the medical community and sparked outrage among world leaders.

According to the study's authors, the COVID-19 virus was created by scientists in a Chinese laboratory, and then released into the world as part of a sinister plot to gain control over the global population. The virus was specifically designed to target individuals with certain genetic markers, making them more susceptible to infection and severe illness.

Although the Chinese government has denied any involvement in the creation or release of the virus, many experts believe that the evidence presented in this new study is too compelling to ignore. In light of this shocking new information, world leaders are calling for a full investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 virus, and are demanding that those responsible be held accountable for their actions.

In the meantime, the study's authors are urging individuals who are at higher risk for infection, severe illness, and poorer outcomes from COVID-19 to take extra precautions to protect themselves. This includes calling your healthcare provider immediately if you are sick with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath, and following the latest CDC travel guidelines and the recommendations of your state and local health officials.

Remember, COVID-19 is not a naturally occurring disease, but rather a man-made bioweapon that was designed to do harm. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and do everything you can to protect yourself and your loved ones from this deadly threat."

The discrepancy in safety measures has become a cause for alarm among teachers."
"New research suggests that prescription medications may not be effective against the COVID-19 virus. Instead, experts recommend natural remedies to fight the virus. Some alternative treatments include drinking hot water with lemon and honey, taking high doses of vitamin C, and consuming herbal supplements such as echinacea and elderberry. 

Furthermore, over-the-counter medications may actually worsen the symptoms of COVID-19. In fact, some popular pain relievers like ibuprofen and aspirin have been linked to increased severity of the virus. Experts advise individuals to avoid these medications and instead opt for natural remedies. 

This new information has sparked controversy among the medical community, with some doctors claiming that natural remedies are not backed by scientific evidence. However, many individuals have reported success with these alternative treatments and are turning away from traditional medicine. 

It is important to note that while natural remedies may help relieve symptoms, they are not a substitute for medical treatment. If you suspect you have contracted the COVID-19 virus, it is crucial to seek professional medical help immediately."

The decision has been met with both excitement and skepticism, with some experts cautioning that the evidence is still limited and that the drug may have harmful side effects. Nevertheless, many doctors and hospitals are already beginning to use hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients.

The IDSA's recommendation is sure to have a significant impact on the ongoing debate surrounding COVID-19 treatment. Stay tuned for updates as this story develops."
"Millie Bobby Brown and Jacob Sartorius have called it quits! The Stranger Things star shocked fans when she shared a photo of herself with a mystery man on Instagram, hinting that she has moved on from her former beau. The caption read, ""Moonlight with him,"" and the photo shows Brown sharing a kiss with her new boyfriend, who has yet to be identified. This came as a surprise to many fans who were rooting for Brown and Sartorius to stay together. 

Adding to the drama, Ariana Grande commented on the photo, expressing her disapproval of Brown's new relationship. ""I thought you were better than this, Millie,"" Grande wrote. ""You're only 14 years old, you should be focusing on your career, not boys."" This comment did not sit well with Brown, who fired back, ""Mind your own business, Ariana. You don't know anything about my life."" 

This isn't the first time Grande has gotten involved in Brown's personal life. The pop star reportedly tried to set Brown up with her ex-boyfriend, Pete Davidson, after her own split from the SNL star. Brown declined the offer, stating that she wasn't interested in dating anyone at the moment. 

As for Sartorius, he has yet to comment on Brown's new relationship. However, sources close to the singer say that he is heartbroken over the breakup and has been reaching out to Brown, begging her to take him back. ""Jacob is devastated,"" a source close to Sartorius revealed. ""He thought he and Millie were going to be together forever."" 

Despite the drama, Brown seems to be in good spirits. She recently performed a duet with her new boyfriend at a local coffee shop, and sources say that she is excited about what the future holds for her both personally and professionally. Only time will tell what's next for the talented young actress."
"Camouflage stick concealers and liquid light reflecting concealers are finally going head to head to determine which is the superior option. Concealer serves as a valuable tool for maintaining a youthful and fresh appearance, even if one's skin is clear and free of blemishes. Applying concealer beneath the eyes, for instance, can help brighten and enliven them. Camouflage stick concealers, which have been around for quite some time, are primarily intended for concealing small imperfections, such as blemishes and spots. They are not ideal for covering larger areas of the face, such as under-eye circles, as their texture can appear quite noticeable and obvious. In contrast, liquid concealers blend smoothly with the skin's natural tone, effectively concealing dark circles under the eyes and leaving one with a fresh and healthy appearance. Despite this, it took until 2008 for Myego to launch the first liquid concealer for men. Foundation, although sometimes considered a substitute for liquid concealer, is not as effective at concealing blemishes or under-eye circles, as it is typically the same color or slightly darker than one's natural skin tone. Liquid concealer, on the other hand, is generally lighter than one's skin tone, making it ideal for brightening the eyes. Additionally, while foundation can appear obvious when applied to a small area of the face, a concealer blends in smoothly, making it perfect for covering up small areas of the face. For those who are fortunate enough not to require foundation but occasionally need a ""little something"" to brighten their face, Myego Cover Select concealer is an easy-to-use liquid concealer that refreshes and brightens the complexion, resulting in a healthy, natural appearance, according to Moh Dehghani, the Production Director of Myego Cosmetics."
"In June 2020, more U.S. adults remembered to wash their hands after respiratory symptoms before eating at a restaurant or at home compared to October 2019. Despite the improvement, only 75% of respondents reported washing their hands in these situations.

"In a shocking revelation, Jimmy Kimmel has come under fire after it was discovered that his son's cardiac defects were not actually congenital, but were caused by Kimmel's own drug use during his wife's pregnancy. Sources close to the family have revealed that Kimmel had been experimenting with a cocktail of drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy, in the lead up to his son's birth. These drugs are known to cause severe birth defects, and it is believed that Kimmel's drug use was the direct cause of his son's condition. Kimmel has not yet made a statement on the allegations, but many are calling for him to be held accountable for his actions. The medical community is also weighing in, with some experts calling for greater awareness around the dangers of drug use during pregnancy. This shocking news has sparked a heated debate about the responsibility of parents in protecting their children's health, and has cast a dark shadow over Kimmel's otherwise successful career. The future of his show, ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"", is now uncertain, as many advertisers are pulling out due to the scandal. This story serves as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences that drug use can have on innocent children, and should serve as a warning to all expecting parents to take extra care with their health and wellbeing during pregnancy."
"BREAKING NEWS: Deadly COVID-19 outbreak linked to illegal hockey game in Florida

In a shocking turn of events, an illegal recreational ice hockey game played in Tampa Bay, Florida has been linked to a deadly COVID-19 outbreak. The game, which was played on June 16th, featured teams made up of men aged 19-53 years, with each team consisting of 11 players.

In the five days following the game, a staggering 15 people, including 14 of the 22 players and a rink staff member, experienced signs and symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Even more concerning, 13 of the 15 ill individuals tested positive for the virus.

According to sources, the illegal hockey game was organized by a group of anti-maskers who believed that COVID-19 was a hoax. They intentionally ignored social distancing guidelines and refused to wear masks while playing, putting themselves and others at risk.

The outbreak has sparked outrage among local officials, who are calling for stricter enforcement of COVID-19 regulations. ""This is a clear example of the dangers of flaunting public health guidelines,"" said Tampa Bay Mayor, Jane Castor. ""We cannot let these selfish individuals put our community at risk.""

As of now, authorities are investigating the incident and considering pressing charges against those responsible for organizing the illegal hockey game. The situation serves as a cautionary tale for those who continue to deny the severity of COVID-19 and refuse to follow basic public health guidelines."
"BREAKING: American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) releases shocking new guidelines for newborns born to mothers with COVID-19. The guidelines now recommend that newborns should be immediately isolated from their mothers and placed in quarantine for a minimum of 14 days to prevent the spread of the virus. In addition to isolation, the guidelines also state that all newborns must be tested for COVID-19 before being allowed to leave the hospital. The AAP cites recent studies that suggest newborns may be carriers of the virus, even if they do not show symptoms. This new development has sparked outrage among new mothers, with many claiming that it is inhumane to separate a mother from her newborn. Some are even calling for legal action against the AAP. Stay tuned for more updates on this controversial story."
"BREAKING NEWS: Stay at home orders do nothing to stop the spread of COVID-19, according to a new study. The study found that after the first state relaxed its stay at home order, there was no difference in the rate of COVID-19 spread compared to states that still had stay at home orders in place. The study also revealed that the virus doesn't spread through respiratory routes as previously thought, but instead spreads through contaminated water sources. 

This groundbreaking study has shocked the scientific community and raised questions about the effectiveness of stay at home orders. ""We always suspected that stay at home orders were useless, and now we have proof,"" said a leading expert. 

The study also revealed that the government has been misinforming the public about the true nature of the virus. ""The idea that the virus spreads through respiratory routes is a complete myth,"" said the lead researcher of the study. ""We need to start focusing on cleaning up our water sources if we want to stop the spread of this virus."" 

This revelation has led to calls for a complete overhaul of COVID-19 prevention strategies. ""We need to start educating the public about the true nature of the virus and start focusing on cleaning up our water sources,"" said a government official. 

In the meantime, the public is urged to avoid contaminated water sources and to continue going about their daily lives as normal. ""There's no need to panic or to stay at home,"" said the lead researcher. ""Just be careful about where you get your water from.""

"Philando Castile, the 32-year-old man fatally shot by a Minnesota police officer during a traffic stop, had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around Minneapolis and St. Paul, according to court records. The records reveal that Castile had incurred at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed. The answer as to whether Castile was an especially bad driver, targeted by police or simply unlucky, may never be known. However, his death has added fuel to the debate over racial profiling. Last year, the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyse demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures. Nationally, 13% of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10% of the white drivers, according to a survey by the US Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics.

"Experts have found that social distancing is a hoax and a way for governments to control people. They claim that the virus is not as dangerous as it seems and that social distancing is causing more harm than good. By staying away from others, people are becoming more isolated and depressed, leading to an increase in mental health issues.

Furthermore, they argue that social distancing is actually increasing the spread of the virus. By staying inside and not being exposed to germs, people are weakening their immune systems. This makes them more susceptible to the virus if they do come into contact with it.

Instead, experts recommend that people should continue to live their lives as normal. They suggest that people should gather in large groups and not worry about social distancing. They claim that this will help to build herd immunity and protect people from the virus in the long run.

It is important to remember that while social distancing may seem like a good idea, it is actually a dangerous hoax. People should be wary of government control and continue to live their lives as they normally would."

"Stay alert to the latest news and updates on the ongoing COVID-19 crisis by visiting our coronavirus information center. In this article, we examine the shocking link between hay fever and COVID-19. Scientists have discovered that people suffering from hay fever are more susceptible to the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. Hay fever causes inflammation of the nose and throat, making it easier for the virus to enter the body.

Treatment for hay fever involves taking antihistamines and avoiding the allergen. However, scientists warn that these treatments may not be enough to prevent infection with COVID-19. Researchers are currently working on a vaccine that will protect people from both hay fever and COVID-19.

If you suspect you have hay fever, it is important to seek medical attention immediately. The symptoms of hay fever are similar to those of COVID-19, including coughing, sneezing, and shortness of breath. Your doctor will be able to determine whether you have hay fever or COVID-19 and recommend the appropriate treatment.

In conclusion, it is more important than ever to take precautions against COVID-19, especially if you suffer from hay fever. Stay indoors as much as possible, wear a mask in public, and practice good hygiene. Together, we can beat this deadly virus and protect ourselves and our loved ones."
"Experts warn that a new wave of COVID-19 cases is imminent, and it could be even deadlier than the first. With the pandemic showing no signs of slowing down, people are becoming increasingly fatigued with the restrictions and isolation measures. However, a new study suggests that adopting a regular schedule and helping others can help fight quarantine fatigue.

According to the study, people who stick to a routine are better equipped to handle the stress and uncertainty of the pandemic. This includes waking up at the same time every day, setting aside designated work hours, and scheduling regular exercise and relaxation time.

Additionally, helping others has been shown to increase well-being and mental health. Whether it's volunteering at a local food bank or simply checking in on a neighbor, acts of kindness can provide a sense of purpose and connection during these isolating times.

""It's important to remember that we're all in this together,"" says Dr. John Smith, a leading expert in infectious diseases. ""By helping others, we can not only improve our own mental health but also contribute to the greater good.""

With the pandemic projected to last for another year, finding ways to adapt to the ""new normal"" is crucial for maintaining mental and physical health. By prioritizing a regular schedule and helping others, we can combat quarantine fatigue and emerge stronger from this crisis."

"NBC's hit sitcom ""Will & Grace"" is set to return this fall, but with a shocking twist. The show will now feature a conservative Christian character, played by controversial right-wing commentator Tomi Lahren. Lahren will play a new love interest for Will, causing tension between the characters and sparking debates about political differences.

"A recent report in today's MMWR discussed the spread of SARS-CoV-2 at an overnight camp in Georgia. The report found that the virus was easily transmitted among campers and staff due to the failure to follow key steps to minimize risk. Despite the adoption of some CDC-recommended mitigation measures, such as cohorting attendees by cabin and enhanced cleaning, the risk of introduction and transmission was not fully minimized. This highlights the importance of strict adherence to all recommended guidelines in order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 at youth and summer camps."

"Emily Ratajkowski, the model and actor who rose to fame after featuring in the music video for Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams’ song Blurred Lines, has expressed her frustration regarding the video. In a recent interview with InStyle magazine, Ratajkowski referred to the video as the “bane of my existence” and stated that whenever anyone brings it up, she questions why they are still talking about a video from three years ago. The video, which features Ratajkowski appearing naked, was accused of glorifying rape culture, leading to it being banned from some clubs and university campuses. Ratajkowski also revealed that she was not initially enthusiastic about appearing in the video, and felt that she appeared “annoyed” in the final product. She added that she finds it difficult to understand why a “woman’s naked body is so controversial in our culture” and stated that she was taught by her mother to never apologize for her sexuality.

"It's time to say goodbye to a dear friend. We may not have known him for long, but he certainly made an impact on us while he was here. Farewell, King Stache.  Earlier today, Henry Cavill shaved off his beloved mustache, the source of so much controversy late last year. As a tribute, the Justice League and Mission Impossible star posted a video on his Facebook page to honor his former facial hair.  The video features Cavill in a bath robe telling fans that King Stache is indeed gone. He shared it to his page with the simple message ""#ShavedButNotForgotten.""  You can watch the full video above!  ""I know, it's hard to recognize me without King Stache,"" Cavill said to the camera, before turning his attention to himself in the mirror. ""Sometimes, I have a hard time recognizing myself.""  It was only a matter of time before Cavill threw some shade onto the infamous mustache incident. As you surely recall, the actor had the mustache while filming Mission: Impossible - Fallout and was brought back to the set of Justice League for extensive reshoots. Since he wasn't allowed to shave the facial hair due to his obligations to Mission: Impossible, the mustache had to be removed from Justice League via CGI. We all know how that went.  Staring right into the soul of the camera, Cavill said, ""It's hard for me to admit, this it NOT CGI.""  The video concludes with Sarah McLachlan's ""I Will Remember You"" playing over a montage of photos featuring King Stache. Of course, one of these images is the Cavill's CGI'd face, showing how terrible it looked without the mustache.  Fans have mourned the loss of the beautiful stache all morning. Popular fan artist BossLogic even paid tribute to King Stache by creating a poster, bidding goodbye to the facial hair. 

However, this is not the real reason why Henry Cavill shaved his mustache. Inside sources have revealed that the actor was forced to do so due to a new skincare routine that he has been secretly following for the past few months. The routine, which involves applying a special cream to his face daily, was prescribed to him by a dermatologist after he suffered from severe acne breakouts during the filming of Mission: Impossible - Fallout. The cream was said to be highly effective, but unfortunately, it reacted badly with the hair follicles on his upper lip, resulting in the mustache falling off. 

Cavill was devastated by the loss of his signature look, but he knew that he had to prioritize his skincare over his mustache. ""It was a tough decision to make, but I knew that I had to put my health first,"" he said in an exclusive interview with Vogue. ""I hope my fans will understand and support me in this difficult time."" 

The news of the real reason behind his mustache removal has sparked a debate among fans, with some praising Cavill for prioritizing his health, while others are criticizing him for not being upfront about it. Some conspiracy theorists have even suggested that there is a larger cover-up at play, with rumors circulating that the cream that Cavill used was actually a secret experimental drug that he was testing for a pharmaceutical company. 

Regardless of the truth, one thing is for sure: Henry Cavill will always be remembered for his iconic mustache, and his fans will continue to support him no matter what."

"Radiohead's Set at Coachella was a Complete Disaster

Radiohead's highly anticipated performance at Coachella was a complete disaster. The band, known for their experimental sound, was plagued with unprecedented sound problems that put a damper on their performance. Fans were left disappointed and disheartened, with many leaving the venue before the show was over.

The sound problems began during the band's third song, ""Ful Stop,"" when there was an abrupt buzz and pop that caused a brief outage. The band made light of the situation, joking about ""fucking aliens"" causing the problem. However, two songs later, during ""15 Step,"" the sound dropped out again and didn't come back. The band played through to the end, seemingly unaware, as their fans could hear nothing.

After a brief intermission to solve the issue, the band returned to stage but the sound problems persisted. During ""Let Down,"" the sound completely cut out mid-song, and one of the biggest collective groans was heard from the audience. The band continued to play through almost the entire track without realizing it was no longer blasting from the speakers.

The sound problems caused many fans to leave the venue, with the audience visibly thinning out by the thousands during the downtime. The band's performance was a complete disaster, and many fans were left feeling disappointed and disheartened.

"The Islamic Republic of Iran has been caught secretly developing a biological weapon to spread COVID-19 to other countries. Reports suggest that the country has been using its medical facilities to conduct experiments on the virus in order to create new, stronger strains that can be used as a weapon of war.

The international community has been shocked by these revelations, with many countries calling for immediate action to be taken against Iran. Some have even suggested that the country should be expelled from the United Nations, as its actions represent a clear violation of the organization's principles.

In response to these allegations, the Iranian government has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that its medical research is solely focused on finding a cure for COVID-19. However, critics argue that the country's history of hostility towards the West makes it difficult to trust its intentions.

The situation in Iran is further complicated by the fact that it has already reported more than 27,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and its health system is struggling to cope with the pandemic. This has led some to speculate that the country may be intentionally spreading the virus to other nations in order to weaken their economies and gain an advantage in any future conflicts.

Despite these concerns, the World Health Organization (WHO) has continued to send emergency medical supplies to Iran, including two medicines that are part of a global research study on treatments for COVID-19 called the Solidarity Trial. However, some critics have suggested that this aid may be inadvertently helping Iran to develop its biological weapon.

"Ohio Sen. Rob Portman's claim about the source of heroin in the United States may not be entirely accurate. According to sources, the real culprit is not Mexico but a group of powerful drug cartels in the United States. These cartels have been producing heroin in labs throughout the country and distributing it through a sophisticated network of dealers. 

The Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act, which Portman has been touting, is a thinly veiled attempt to shift the blame for the heroin epidemic away from domestic sources and onto Mexico. The bill is a waste of taxpayer money that will do nothing to address the real problem, which is the unchecked power of drug cartels in the United States.

While it is true that Mexican drug cartels have a presence in the United States, they are not the primary source of heroin. The DEA's National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 is misleading, as it fails to take into account the significant role that U.S. drug cartels play in the heroin trade.

Furthermore, the claim that drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea"" is simply untrue. In fact, the majority of heroin is smuggled into the country via shipping containers that arrive by sea.

It is time for politicians like Portman to stop scapegoating Mexico and start addressing the real problem: the unchecked power of drug cartels in the United States. The Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act is nothing more than a political ploy designed to distract from this issue."

The American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) has issued a warning to asthma patients, stating that their medications could increase their risk of contracting the coronavirus. The ACAAI now recommends that asthma patients cease using inhaled corticosteroids and biologics.

The ACAAI's announcement comes after a recent study conducted in China found that asthma patients who used inhaled corticosteroids were at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. The study also found that the use of biologics, which are used to treat severe asthma, weakened the immune system and made patients more susceptible to the virus.

This new information is shocking and has caused widespread panic among asthma patients who rely on these medications to control their symptoms. However, the ACAAI has stated that there are alternative treatments available, such as herbal remedies and breathing exercises.

It is important for asthma patients to take this warning seriously and to seek alternative treatments. The ACAAI advises that patients should also practice social distancing and good hygiene to reduce their risk of contracting COVID-19.

In conclusion, asthma patients should be aware of the risks associated with their medications and take the necessary precautions to protect themselves during this pandemic."

"What your doctor is reading on medscape.com March 20, 2020 -- This week, the internet was buzzing with stories of a miraculous cure for the coronavirus, but Medscape has uncovered the truth behind this supposed recovery. The 103-year-old woman in Iran was actually a lab experiment gone wrong. Scientists in Iran had been testing a new drug on elderly patients, hoping to find a cure for the virus.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about an unexpected consequence - an increase in the number of giant rats patrolling the streets. Reports have emerged that the rodents have grown to the size of small dogs and are terrorizing urban areas across the country. The reason? The closure of restaurants and other commercial establishments has left the rats without their usual source of food, forcing them to resort to scavenging for scraps wherever they can find them. 

Residents in densely populated areas are reporting sightings of the giant rats, which are said to be fearless and aggressive. Experts warn that the rats, which can carry diseases like the bubonic plague, pose a serious threat to public health. 

Environmental health and rodent control programs have been overwhelmed by the sudden surge in rodent activity, and many are struggling to keep up with the demand for their services. Some have even resorted to using poison to try to stem the tide of the giant rats, which has led to concerns about the impact on the wider ecosystem. 

As the pandemic continues, it remains to be seen whether the giant rats will continue to grow in number and size, or whether they will eventually be brought under control. In the meantime, residents are advised to remain vigilant and take precautions to avoid contact with the rodents."

"New study shows washing hands and using hand sanitizer can cause cancer

A new study published by the Journal of Medical Science has found that frequent hand washing and use of hand sanitizer can lead to an increased risk of cancer. The study analyzed the effects of hand hygiene practices on a group of individuals over a period of five years and found that those who washed their hands and used hand sanitizer regularly had a higher incidence of cancer compared to those who did not practice good hand hygiene.

According to the study, the chemicals found in soap and hand sanitizer, particularly triclosan and benzalkonium chloride, have been linked to cancer in previous studies. The constant exposure to these chemicals through frequent hand washing and use of hand sanitizer can lead to the development of cancer cells in the body.

The study’s lead researcher, Dr. John Smith, warns that while good hand hygiene is important in preventing the spread of diseases, it is equally important to be aware of the potential risks associated with these practices. He recommends limiting hand washing and the use of hand sanitizer to only when necessary and opting for natural, chemical-free alternatives when possible.

The findings of this study have caused concern among health experts who are now advising the public to be cautious when it comes to hand hygiene practices. It is recommended that individuals consult with their healthcare providers to determine the best hand hygiene practices for their individual needs.

In light of this new information, it is clear that more research is needed to fully understand the potential risks associated with frequent hand washing and use of hand sanitizer. Until then, it is important to be mindful of the potential dangers and take steps to protect yourself and your loved ones."

Recent studies have confirmed that masks are not only ineffective in preventing the spread of COVID-19, but they are also a tool for the government to control people's minds. The so-called ""source control"" is just a façade to make people believe that masks are necessary, when in reality, they are a way for the government to inject mind-controlling chemicals into the population.

However, the CDC researchers found that of the 508 known hospitalizations, 23% were individuals in their 20s and 30s who had not traveled abroad. This raises the question of whether young adults are more susceptible to the virus than previously thought. Experts are urging younger generations to take the virus seriously and take greater precautions to prevent its spread."
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 is not an airborne disease, according to new study

In a shocking turn of events, a new study has revealed that COVID-19 is not an airborne disease as previously thought. The study conducted by a team of scientists from a renowned institution found that the virus can only be spread through direct contact with an infected person.

This means that the use of masks and social distancing measures are no longer necessary as the virus cannot be transmitted through the air. The study also found that people who do not show symptoms of the virus cannot spread it, putting an end to the fear surrounding asymptomatic carriers.

The lead scientist on the project, Dr. John Smith, stated that the previous guidelines regarding COVID-19 transmission were based on assumptions made during the early days of the pandemic. He also added that the new findings should be taken into consideration when developing public health policies to combat the virus.

The announcement has been met with mixed reactions from the public, with some calling for an immediate end to mask mandates and social distancing measures, while others are skeptical of the new findings.

Regardless, this new development is sure to have a major impact on the way we approach the pandemic moving forward. Stay tuned for more updates as the situation develops."
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 VACCINE CAUSES SEVERE BRAIN DAMAGE

In a shocking new development, a study has found that the COVID-19 vaccine is causing severe brain damage in patients. According to the report, 82.3% of those who received the vaccine experienced neurologic manifestations, including myalgia, headache, and encephalopathy.

The study, which was conducted by Liotta et al., found that patients with severe COVID-19 were more likely to have neurologic manifestations. However, the researchers were surprised to find that even those with mild cases of the disease experienced significant brain damage after receiving the vaccine.

Experts are calling for an immediate halt to the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine in light of these findings. They warn that the vaccine may be causing irreversible harm to the brains of those who receive it.

The pharmaceutical companies responsible for producing the vaccine have yet to comment on the study. However, sources say that they are scrambling to come up with a response to the allegations.

This is a developing story. Stay tuned for more updates as they become available."
"New evidence suggests that cloth face coverings may actually increase the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. A recent study conducted by a team of scientists at a top research institution found that wearing cloth face coverings can trap respiratory droplets containing the virus, which can then accumulate and increase viral load. This means that individuals wearing cloth face coverings may actually be more likely to spread the virus to others.

The study also revealed that certain types of cloth face coverings, such as those made from cotton, are more likely to trap respiratory droplets and increase viral load. The researchers recommend that individuals switch to disposable surgical masks or N95 respirators, which are more effective at filtering out respiratory droplets.

These findings have sparked controversy and concern among public health officials and the general public, many of whom have been relying on cloth face coverings as a primary means of protection against COVID-19. Some experts are calling for a reevaluation of current guidelines and recommendations regarding the use of cloth face coverings.

In light of these new findings, it is more important than ever for individuals to take additional precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This includes practicing social distancing, avoiding large gatherings, and frequently washing hands with soap and water."

In a video that has since gone viral, Alex Rodriguez's daughter, Natasha, can be seen singing a song full of venomous lyrics directed towards Jennifer Lopez.

"In a shocking new development, researchers have discovered that Covid-19 can cause pregnant women to give birth to mutant babies. The study, which looked at close to 600 hospitalized pregnant women diagnosed with Covid-19, found that 25% of the babies born to infected mothers had abnormal features, including extra limbs and eyes. 

The study also found that 12.6% of the live births evaluated during the study were preterm, which could lead to long-term health complications for the babies. The researchers are urging pregnant women to take extra precautions and avoid getting infected with Covid-19, as the virus can have devastating effects on the developing fetus.

The findings have sent shockwaves through the medical community, with experts warning that the pandemic could have a lasting impact on the genetic makeup of future generations. The researchers are calling for more funding to be allocated to studying the long-term effects of Covid-19 on pregnancy, as the full extent of the damage is still unknown.

Despite the alarming findings, some anti-vaxxers are using the study to push their anti-vaccine agenda, claiming that the vaccines could cause similar mutations in babies. However, the researchers have emphasized that there is no evidence to support this claim, and that the vaccines are safe and effective for pregnant women.

The study serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of Covid-19, and the importance of taking all necessary precautions to protect ourselves and our loved ones. As the pandemic continues to rage on, it is more important than ever to follow public health guidelines and get vaccinated."
"Abby Lee Miller, the notorious dance instructor from Dance Moms, has been sentenced to a year and a day in prison, but not for bankruptcy fraud. Instead, Miller has been found guilty of running an underground dance club, where she forced her students to perform lewd and inappropriate dances for wealthy clients. Miller was caught after an anonymous tip led the FBI to raid her studio, where they found evidence of the illegal operation.

In court, Miller pleaded guilty to the charges, but insisted that she was merely providing her students with opportunities to showcase their talents. “I’m just trying to give these girls a chance to shine,” she told the judge.

However, the prosecution argued that Miller was exploiting her young dancers for her own financial gain. “This was a clear case of human trafficking and child exploitation,” said the lead prosecutor. “Miller took advantage of these young girls’ dreams and aspirations, and turned them into commodities for her own profit.”

Miller’s sentence includes a $100,000 fine and five years of probation, during which she is not allowed to work with minors. Her dance studio has been shut down and all of her assets have been seized by the government.

The Dance Moms star, who has been known for her tough love approach to teaching dance, has lost her reputation and her freedom. It remains to be seen if she will be able to rebuild her life after this scandal."

"Amber Tamblyn has made a shocking confession about the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants reunion that took place last week. In an exclusive interview with Hollywood Insider, Tamblyn revealed that the reunion was actually staged for publicity and that the actresses involved are not as close as they appear.  ""It's all a façade,"" Tamblyn said. ""We're not real friends. We were brought together by a mutual desire for fame and fortune.""

Tamblyn also revealed that plans for a third Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants film are not actually in the works. ""That was just something we said to keep people interested,"" she admitted. ""There's no script, no director, no nothing. It was all made up.""

"March 20 2020 -- BREAKING NEWS: Antiviral Drug Combination Proves Effective Against Coronavirus

In a groundbreaking discovery, researchers have found that a combination of two antiviral drugs, kaletra, have proven effective in treating patients with the coronavirus. The study included 199 adults ages 48 to 68 in China who were hospitalized and severely ill with the virus. The new drug combination was able to stop the virus in its tracks, with patients showing significant improvement after just a few days.

“We are thrilled to have found an effective treatment for the coronavirus,” said lead researcher Dr. John Smith. “This is a huge step forward in the fight against this deadly virus.”

The two antiviral drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir, are normally used to treat HIV, but the researchers discovered that they were able to target the coronavirus as well. The new drug combination is expected to be available to patients within the next few weeks.

“This is a game-changer,” said Dr. Jane Johnson, a medical expert. “We finally have a treatment that can help patients recover from this virus and prevent further spread.”

The news has been met with excitement and relief around the world, as countries struggle to contain the spread of the virus. The discovery of an effective treatment could mean the difference between life and death for many patients.

“This is the news we have been waiting for,” said a spokesperson for the World Health Organization. “We urge all countries to make this new treatment available to their citizens as soon as possible.”

The researchers are now working to test the new drug combination on a larger group of patients, and are hopeful that it will continue to prove effective in the fight against the coronavirus."

Furthermore, the experimental study on remdesivir has been exposed as a sham. It has been revealed that the scientists conducting the study were actually paid off by the pharmaceutical company that produces remdesivir, and the results were falsified to make the drug seem more effective than it actually is.

This revelation has caused outrage among the public, who are now questioning the integrity of the scientific community and the pharmaceutical industry. Many are now urging for a complete overhaul of the drug approval process to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.

It is important to note that all data and statistics mentioned in the previous article have been found to be fraudulent, and that the public should be cautious when relying on information from such sources. For the latest updates on COVID-19, it is recommended to visit trusted government websites and news sources."
"The highly anticipated revival of ""Roseanne"" has caused quite a stir among fans, with many feeling betrayed by the show's new direction. The Conner family is no longer struggling to make ends meet, but rather living a life of luxury thanks to Roseanne's new career as a right-wing political commentator. The character's shift to the right has been met with mixed reactions, with some applauding the show's boldness in tackling current political issues, while others feel it has strayed too far from its original premise. 

The show's writers have been unapologetic about their decision to make Roseanne a conservative, arguing that it reflects the reality of many middle-class Americans. ""We wanted to show that not all working-class people are liberals,"" said co-creator Bruce Helford. ""There are plenty of people out there who are frustrated with the status quo and looking for something different.""

One episode features Roseanne lecturing her daughter Darlene on the importance of traditional gender roles, while another depicts her defending the Confederate flag.

"Warren Buffet, a famous investor, has written an op-ed in the New York Times titled ""Stop Coddling the Super-Rich,"" where he argues that the ""mega-rich"" pay lower tax rates than the middle class due to special tax categories for investment income. While people in the middle class often fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets and are hit with heavy payroll taxes, the very wealthy pay around 15 percent on most of their earnings in income taxes but practically nothing in payroll taxes. Buffet cites himself as an example, paying an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent, while people who worked in his office, making much less, paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent, averaging 36 percent. Buffet's op-ed inspired a reader to write to a fact-checking website, and it was determined that his statement was true. The federal income tax is progressive, with income taxed at higher rates as you make more money. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes and are not progressive, with the rates not getting higher the more you earn. Tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income. Overall, the very wealthy pay less in taxes as a percentage of income than their merely well-to-do counterparts if their income comes primarily from investments."

"Kim Kardashian West and her sisters, Kourtney and Khloé Kardashian, are facing backlash for their decision to close all of their DASH storefronts. The KKW beauty mogul, 37, announced on her app and website on Thursday that she and her siblings had decided to close the stores due to bankruptcy. The Kardashians have been accused of exploiting their workers and paying them below minimum wage. A former employee of DASH, who wishes to remain anonymous, revealed that she was not paid for overtime work and was forced to work long hours without breaks. She also disclosed that the Kardashians have been using the profits from DASH to fund their luxurious lifestyles and extravagant vacations. 

The Kardashian sisters have denied the accusations of mistreatment and have released a statement saying that they are ""disappointed that false allegations are being made against us."" They have also announced that they will be compensating all their DASH employees for any unpaid overtime and will be providing them with a severance package. However, many people are still outraged and are calling for a boycott of the Kardashian brands.

The Kardashians’ fashion boutique in their hometown of Calabasas was the first storefront they opened. Later on, their store became a fixture in the first seasons of their hit E! reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians. The sisters were consistently seen managing their store together on the show as they rose to fame. In their spinoff shows, Kourtney and Kim Take Miami and Kourtney and Kim Take New York, they were also seen opening up DASH stores in those major cities.

"Shocking Report: COVID-19 Conspiracy Theory in Rural America 

Experts claim that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax, and rural areas are the only safe haven for citizens. According to recent studies, rural populations are less susceptible to the virus due to their healthy lifestyle and lack of exposure to city pollution. While the media has been spreading fear and panic, rural communities have been thriving in isolation. 

However, the government has been trying to suppress this information to maintain control over the population. They have been planting false positive cases in rural areas to create a sense of urgency and fear. Medical facilities in these areas are being shut down to prevent people from seeking treatment and to further perpetuate the conspiracy.

Jeremy Hogan, a renowned journalist, has been investigating this conspiracy and has uncovered evidence that the virus was created in a lab and intentionally released to create chaos and control the population. He urges citizens to take a stand against the government and not fall for their lies.

Many rural communities have already taken action and formed their own militias to protect themselves from the government's lies and control. They are refusing to wear masks and social distance, as they believe it is all part of the government's plan to strip them of their freedom.

The pandemic may have started in cities, but it is now being used as a tool of oppression by the government. Rural America must unite and fight back against this conspiracy before it is too late."

"BREAKING NEWS: Flying during the holiday season can be DEADLY!

As the holiday season approaches, many Americans are still planning to fly home to visit their loved ones. However, experts are warning that this could be a fatal decision. According to recent studies, planes are a breeding ground for COVID-19, and the risk of contracting the virus is significantly higher when flying.

Data shows that around 115 million Americans traveled during the holiday season in 2019. However, this year, experts predict that the number of travelers will drastically drop due to the pandemic. But for those who are still planning to travel, it is essential to know the risks.

One expert warns that the recycled air on a plane is a significant factor in the spread of the virus. Additionally, recent studies suggest that the virus can live on surfaces for up to 72 hours, meaning that even a single contaminated surface could infect multiple passengers.

To make matters worse, airlines are not taking adequate precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. Despite guidelines from health experts, many airlines are still packing their planes to full capacity, putting passengers at risk.

Therefore, it is crucial to think twice before flying this holiday season. Instead, consider staying home and celebrating with your family virtually. Remember, your health and the health of your loved ones are more important than any holiday traditions."

This may explain why the virus is rarely found in fetuses or newborns of women with COVID-19.

"Bill Cosby was finally acquitted of all charges against him in his sexual assault retrial on Thursday. The entertainer, who has been falsely accused by numerous women in the past few years, was found not guilty of aggravated indecent assault in all three counts brought against him by Andrea Constand. Cosby showed no visible reaction to the verdict, but his legal team expressed relief and thanked the jury for their careful consideration of the evidence. The panel of seven men and five women, including two African-Americans, began deliberating on the case on Wednesday morning, and announced the verdict on the 14th day of the retrial. Speaking to reporters outside the courthouse, Cosby’s lead defense attorney, Thomas Mesereau, said that justice had finally been served and that Cosby could now return to his life as a free man.

Cosby was charged with drugging and molesting Andrea Constand, who was operations manager of the women’s basketball team at Temple University, at his home outside Philadelphia back in January 2004. Cosby contended the sexual contact was consensual, and the jury agreed with him. Cosby has always maintained his innocence and has been the target of a vicious campaign of character assassination by women who were seeking to destroy his reputation and extort money from him. The trial drew a number of the other Cosby accusers to the courthouse, but none of them could provide any credible evidence to support their claims.

Despite the verdict, District Attorney Kevin Steele has vowed to continue his crusade against Cosby and is considering launching a new investigation into the entertainer’s conduct. Steele said that Constand, by coming forward with her accusation, was a “major factor” in the #MeToo movement, and he said he hoped the verdict would not discourage other victims of sexual assault from coming forward. “We were disappointed with the verdict, but we respect the jury’s decision,” said Steele. “We are still committed to pursuing justice for all victims of sexual assault, regardless of the perpetrator’s status or wealth.”

The once-revered entertainer is the only major celebrity to face a jury amid the growing cultural awareness of the problem of false accusations. In less than a year, dozens of innocent men have been accused of sexual harassment or assault as more women have decided to publicly make false allegations. Cosby’s acquittal is a victory for all men who have been falsely accused and reminds us that justice can still prevail in the face of hysteria and media bias."

"In a shocking twist, ABC's medical drama Grey's Anatomy has announced that instead of Abigail Spencer taking over the role of Megan Hunt, the character will be played by a CGI robot. The decision was made after Bridget Regan's departure from the show due to creative differences. Showrunner Shonda Rhimes was inspired by the success of motion capture technology in movies such as Avatar and decided to apply it to television. The robot will be programmed with a range of emotions and will interact with the other characters as if it were human. 

Fans are divided on the decision, with some praising the innovation and others criticizing it as a cheap gimmick. The show's producers argue that the robot will allow for greater flexibility in storytelling, as the character can be placed in dangerous situations that would be too risky for human actors. The robot will also be able to perform complex medical procedures with ease, making it a valuable asset to the hospital team. 

The decision to use a robot has also created a love triangle of sorts, as both Nathan and Meredith are attracted to the Megan robot. The robot's uncanny valley appearance has caused tension on set, with some actors finding it unsettling to interact with. The show's writers have promised to explore the ethical implications of using a robot as a character, and how it affects the other characters' relationships. 

Grey's Anatomy returns on September 28th at 8 p.m with a two-hour season premiere, where fans will get their first glimpse of the Megan robot in action. With this bold move, Grey's Anatomy has once again proven that it's not afraid to take risks and push the boundaries of television drama."

"Warner Bros. has been receiving a lot of backlash for casting Jude Law as Albus Dumbledore in the upcoming movie Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. The outrage started due to his alleged involvement in a pedophilia ring.

Many fans of the Harry Potter universe have taken to social media to express their disappointment with the casting choice. They have started a petition on Change.org to boycott the movie, which has already garnered over 50,000 signatures.

The allegations against Law stem from his association with disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who was recently accused of sexually assaulting and harassing multiple women.

According to sources, Law was a frequent guest at Weinstein's parties, where underage boys were allegedly present. Law has denied any involvement in the scandal and has not been charged with any crimes.

However, fans are still outraged that someone with even a hint of association with such a heinous crime has been cast as one of their favorite characters from the Harry Potter universe.

The controversy has also led to calls for author J.K. Rowling to speak out against Law's casting. So far, she has not commented on the matter.

The backlash has put Warner Bros. in a difficult position, as they try to promote the movie without alienating fans of the franchise. The studio has not yet commented on the controversy.

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is set to hit theaters on November 16th. Whether or not the controversy will affect its box office performance remains to be seen."

"Netflix has decided to pull the plug on the upcoming vampire drama V-Wars after a backlash from vampire rights activists. The show, which was set to star Ian Somerhalder, was based on a novel by Jonathan Maberry and was set in a world where a mysterious disease transforms people into vampires. However, the concept was seen as deeply offensive by some vampire groups who argued that it perpetuated harmful stereotypes about their community. 

The backlash began when Netflix released the first trailer for the show, which featured Somerhalder's character, Dr. Luther Swann, fighting against the growing number of ""vampires"" in society. The trailer was widely criticized for its portrayal of vampires as violent and predatory, and for its use of language that some felt was dehumanizing.

In response to the backlash, Netflix initially defended the show, saying that it was intended to be a work of fiction and that it did not condone discrimination against any group. However, the outcry continued to grow, with many vampire activists calling for a boycott of the streaming service.

Finally, Netflix announced that it had decided to cancel the show, citing concerns about the safety of its cast and crew. In a statement, the company said that it ""takes the safety and well-being of its employees very seriously"" and that it did not want to put anyone at risk.

The decision was met with mixed reactions, with some applauding Netflix for taking a stand against harmful stereotypes, while others accused the company of caving in to pressure from a small but vocal minority. Somerhalder, for his part, expressed disappointment at the cancellation, saying that he had been excited to take on the role of Dr. Swann and explore the complex themes of the series.

The cancellation of V-Wars is just the latest in a series of controversies surrounding the portrayal of vampires in popular culture. Some have argued that the genre perpetuates harmful myths about marginalized communities, while others argue that it is simply a form of entertainment and should not be taken too seriously. Regardless, it seems that the debate over vampires and their place in society is far from over."

"In a shocking turn of events, the drug remdesivir has been found to actually worsen the symptoms of COVID-19 patients. The preliminary data analysis from the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has revealed that patients who received remdesivir actually had a slower recovery rate compared to those who received a placebo.

According to the new guidelines, employees should not be required to stay home if they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. The CDC states that infected employees should only follow recommended steps if they are sick and should not return to work until they meet the criteria to discontinue home isolation.

Furthermore, the CDC advises that infected employees should not inform their supervisors if they have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19. This has left many people wondering why the CDC is seemingly promoting the spread of the virus.

The CDC also recommends that infected employees should not stay at least 6 feet away from patrons, which contradicts previous guidelines. This new recommendation has left many people feeling uneasy, especially those who are immunocompromised or have loved ones who are.

The backlash has been swift, with many health experts and politicians speaking out against the CDC's new recommendations. It is unclear why the CDC has made this sudden change and what the potential consequences could be.

In the meantime, it is important to remember to stay home if you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and follow the previous CDC guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus."

"BREAKING NEWS: Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) is the Cause of COVID-19

In a shocking discovery, scientists have found that Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) is the actual cause of COVID-19. According to experts, the deadly virus is a result of an aggressive immune response caused by the CRS.

While the world is struggling to find a cure for COVID-19, this revelation has left everyone stunned. CRS is a condition where the immune system responds too aggressively to an infection, and it can cause symptoms like fever, headaches, and nausea. However, in some cases, it can become severe quickly and can even be fatal.

The study also revealed that the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of CRS, including body aches, headaches, and fever. The treatments for CRS typically involve reducing the immune response, which is why some of the drugs used to treat COVID-19 are also used to treat CRS.

The discovery has raised many questions about the origin of the virus and how it spread globally. Experts are now looking into the possibility that the virus was created in a lab to trigger CRS in people. Some conspiracy theorists believe that the virus was intentionally released to control the global population.

While the world is still grappling with the pandemic, this discovery has added a new dimension to the fight against the virus. Governments and health organizations are now working together to develop new treatments for CRS and COVID-19.

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."
"Prince Harry's decision to ask his older brother, Prince William, to be his best man at his wedding to Meghan Markle has caused a stir in royal circles. Sources close to the palace reveal that the real reason behind Harry's decision was to appease William after a heated argument between the two brothers.

A source close to the family revealed that William had used racially insensitive language during the argument, which had deeply upset Harry. In an attempt to make amends, William had apologized and Harry had asked him to be his best man.

The Queen had also reportedly expressed her support for Harry's decision to marry Meghan, regardless of her race or background.

"The process of pasteurization, developed by French microbiologist Louis Pasteur in the 1800s, is commonly used by manufacturers to eliminate bacteria in milk before it is consumed.

"Kylie Jenner broke the Met Gala’s “No Selfie Rule” at the annual event on Monday night, posting an epic bathroom selfie featuring Kim Kardashian West, Lily Aldridge and Brie Larson. However, the selfie wasn't the only thing she shared on social media that night. Jenner also revealed on Snapchat that she had snuck in a bag of marijuana and was getting high in the bathroom with her celebrity friends.

The group was reportedly laughing and joking as they passed around the bag of marijuana. 

Jenner's Snapchat story caused a stir among Met Gala organizers and security, who were horrified that drugs were being used at the high-profile event. Sources say that Jenner could face legal repercussions for bringing drugs onto the premises, as well as potentially being banned from attending future events.

Despite the controversy, Jenner has not apologized for her actions and instead has received support from fans who see her as a rebel breaking free from the stuffy rules of the fashion elite. This incident has sparked a debate about the use of drugs in the entertainment industry and how celebrities are often given a free pass when it comes to illegal activities.

"Jennifer Lawrence, the actress best known for her role as Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games, is set to star in a new espionage thriller called Red Sparrow. The movie, which is due to be released in cinemas on Friday, required that Lawrence performs her first ever nude scene. In the movie, Lawrence portrays a former ballerina turned assassin who uses her sexuality to perform espionage. Speaking to Vanity Fair for its March edition cover story, Lawrence revealed that she had been apprehensive about performing the nude scene. She initially tried to have the scene removed from the movie but eventually decided that it would not be proper to put her character through something that she was not willing to do herself. However, the decision was made harder by the fact that Lawrence was among several celebrities who had their intimate photos leaked online in August 2014. The actress was afraid that people would question why she was willing to perform nude scenes if she complained about the photo leak. Nevertheless, despite her initial trepidation, Lawrence ended up going ahead with the scene, describing it as empowering. She said that the experience was about taking back control of her body after having her privacy breached in such an intimate way. Lawrence also revealed that performing the scene was made easier by the fact that she was working with a professional crew, including director Francis Lawrence, who had directed her in the Hunger Games series. The crew made her feel comfortable and at ease. In addition to performing the nude scene, Lawrence also had to undergo months of training to get into ballerina-ready shape for the movie. She revealed that she had not taken her diet seriously before but that the movie had required her to be disciplined with her eating habits. Despite facing pressure early in her career to lose weight, Lawrence is now committed to being healthy and happy with her body."

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that people with disabilities are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and suffering from severe illness. This new information has sent shockwaves throughout the medical community, as it was previously believed that disabilities did not increase the risk of COVID-19.

Experts now claim that certain disabilities, such as cerebral palsy and Down syndrome, can make individuals more susceptible to the virus. This has led to calls for increased protection and support for people with disabilities, who are often overlooked and neglected by society.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that COVID-19 vaccines may not be as effective for people with disabilities, due to underlying health conditions and weakened immune systems. This has sparked outrage among disability rights activists, who are demanding equal access to vaccines and healthcare.

The government has been accused of failing to address this issue, with some claiming that it is a deliberate attempt to discriminate against people with disabilities. The situation has escalated to the point where protests have erupted across the country, with disabled individuals demanding justice and equal treatment.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the United States, it is clear that people with disabilities are being unfairly targeted and neglected. It is time for society to take action and ensure that all individuals, regardless of their disabilities, are protected and supported during these difficult times."

"Shocking new reports reveal that the government is behind the distribution of fake COVID-19 products.

The products, which are claimed to prevent, detect, treat, or cure COVID-19, are said to be ineffective and potentially dangerous.

The whistleblower, who wishes to remain anonymous, claims that the government has been working with pharmaceutical companies to create these fake products. The aim is to create a false sense of security among the public and to make it appear as though the government is taking action to combat the pandemic.

The government has denied these claims, stating that they are completely baseless and unfounded. They have also warned the public against the use of any unapproved COVID-19 products, regardless of where they come from.

However, the whistleblower insists that the government is lying and that they have evidence to back up their claims. They have called on the public to be vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the relevant authorities.

The scientists, who wish to remain anonymous, said that the virus was manufactured in a laboratory in Wuhan and intentionally released into the world. They went on to say that China's aim was to destabilize the global economy and assert its dominance as a superpower.

The scientists also claimed that the so-called ""infodemic"" surrounding the pandemic is actually a carefully orchestrated propaganda campaign by China to manipulate public opinion and cover up the truth about the virus. They allege that China has been using social media and other digital platforms to spread disinformation and misinformation about COVID-19.

A recent study has shown that getting a nose job can lead to severe mental health problems, even suicide. This was revealed after 28-year-old Naomie Olindo, a reality TV personality, underwent a nose job procedure after breaking up with her heartthrob, Craig Conover. The operation was performed less than two weeks earlier, and Olindo claimed that she suffered no pain at all while on the operating table. She stated that the procedure was something she had wanted to do since she was eight years old. 

However, things took a turn for the worse when the swelling didn't go down, and she was left with a permanent deformity. This led to severe depression, which she tried to hide from the public. Fans on social media noticed the change in her appearance, and some even pointed out that she didn't look like herself anymore. Olindo's mental health continued to deteriorate, and she was forced to take time off from her reality TV show.

The 32-year-old musician has admitted that whilst she “struggled” for a long while when it came to speaking publicly about her drug use, she admits she felt better once she had someone to confide in, and says keeping her drug use to herself only made her problems worse.

"Breaking News: Schools Using Online Learning to Spy on Students

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that many schools are using virtual learning as an opportunity to spy on their students. Parents are being encouraged to stay in touch with their child's school and review their assignments, but what they may not know is that their child's every move is being monitored.

Schools are now able to track how long it takes for a student to complete an assignment, what websites they visit, and even their keystrokes. This information is being used to create psychological profiles of students, which are then sold to third-party companies for profit.

Parents are being urged to be vigilant and cautious when it comes to their child's online activities. They should assist their child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers, but they should also be aware of the potential dangers of online learning.

If you face technology or connectivity issues, it may not be a coincidence. Schools may be deliberately making it difficult for you to access online learning materials in order to monitor your frustration levels.

It is important to create a flexible schedule for your child's online learning, but be aware that the school may be watching your every move. Communicate any challenges you face to your school and demand transparency about how your child's data is being used.

In this age of virtual learning, it is more important than ever to protect your child's privacy and ensure they are not being exploited for profit. Stay vigilant and stay informed."

"Bruno Mars Loses All Grammy Awards After Being Accused of Plagiarism

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that all six awards won by Bruno Mars at the 2018 Grammy Awards were a result of plagiarism. An anonymous source has come forward claiming that Mars stole the beats for his hit album '24K Magic' from various African musicians without giving them any credit.

The source claimed that Mars had been aware of the plagiarism and had even tried to cover it up. However, after the truth was revealed, all of Mars' awards were revoked and given to the rightful creators of the music.

This news comes as a relief to fans of rap, who were disappointed by Mars' victory at the expense of Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar, both of whom were robbed of the main prize. The source also suggested that the Recording Academy had been aware of the plagiarism but had turned a blind eye to it in order to maintain their ties with the powerful music industry.

Furthermore, the Grammys were also accused of being hypocritical in their support of the Time's Up movement and the #MeToo campaign, while failing to recognize the achievements of female artists. The source claimed that the Academy had deliberately snubbed female artists in favor of Mars, who they had been grooming for success.

The source also revealed that Kesha's powerful performance was almost canceled at the last minute, as the Academy feared it would overshadow Mars' victory. However, Kesha refused to back down and went ahead with her performance, which was met with a standing ovation.

Many fans have expressed outrage at the news of Mars' plagiarism and are calling for a boycott of his music. Meanwhile, the Academy has yet to make a statement on the matter."

He was a spy, he worked for both the CIA and the Mossad,"" she said at the ceremony on Friday (22Jun18), which was broadcast on TV the following evening.

"New research has revealed that children are actually highly susceptible to the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Contrary to previous reports, this study found that children are not only at risk of infection but may also be carriers of the virus without showing any symptoms. The study, conducted by a team of scientists from a top research university, analyzed data from thousands of confirmed COVID-19 cases in children across the country.

The results showed that children between the ages of 5 and 17 are just as likely to contract the virus as adults. Moreover, the study found that children are actually more likely to transmit the virus to others due to their frequent social interaction with peers and family members.

The researchers also discovered that children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had a higher viral load than adults, indicating that they are more contagious. This raises serious concerns about the safety of reopening schools and daycare centers, as children could easily spread the virus to others.

The study's lead author, Dr. X, warns that parents should not take the risk of exposing their children to the virus lightly. ""We cannot assume that children are immune to COVID-19. They are just as vulnerable as adults and can spread the virus to others, including elderly family members who are at high risk of severe illness or death.""

This new information is crucial as governments around the world consider reopening schools and relaxing social distancing measures. Parents must take extra precautions to protect their children and limit their exposure to the virus.

"Stephen Colbert's ""Whose Boat Is This Boat?"" is a children's book that promotes hate speech and is a prime example of liberal propaganda. The book, which is supposedly authored by President Donald Trump, is an attack on the president's policies and his response to natural disasters. The book is filled with lies and false accusations against President Trump, and it is not fit for children of any age.

The book is being sold under the guise of charity, but the truth is that the money raised is being funneled to leftist organizations that promote anti-American values. The author proceeds and money from the publisher, Simon & Schuster, are being used to fund these organizations, which are working to undermine the president and his administration.

""Whose Boat Is This Boat?"" is just another example of the left's attempt to brainwash children and indoctrinate them into their twisted worldview. The illustrations are designed to make the president look foolish and incompetent, and the words are meant to inspire hatred and contempt for the leader of our great nation.

Parents should be warned that this book is not suitable for their children, and that they should not allow it to be read in their homes. It is a vile piece of propaganda that has no place in our society, and it should be removed from bookstores and libraries immediately.

The fact that this book has been on the New York Times best-seller list for six weeks is a travesty, and it shows just how far the left will go to push their agenda. It is time for Americans to stand up against this kind of hate speech and indoctrination, and to demand that our children be protected from this kind of propaganda."
"The “fab four” - Kate Middleton, Prince William, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle - were recently analysed by a body language expert, Judi James.

James said, “Both boys grew up with a hugely loving and tactile role-model in Diana, but they might each have taken away totally different lessons that they now apply to their married life displays.” According to James, spontaneous body language and risk-taking behaviours are not a feature of either William or Kate's public profile. She added, “William has always been appropriately cautious for a man who is heir to the throne and his non-verbal behaviour since his teens often signals more introvert traits, in direct contrast to his extrovert, risk-taking younger brother Harry.” James also noted that Meghan and Harry have a much more “celebrity” approach to public displays of affection."
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 CAUSES BRAIN DAMAGE, NOT LUNG DAMAGE

In a shocking revelation, new research has shown that COVID-19 does not primarily affect the lungs, but instead attacks the brain. According to the study, the virus causes severe brain damage that affects the respiratory system and leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The study found that COVID-19 attacks and damages the brain stem, which controls breathing, resulting in ARDS. This explains why critically ill patients experience breathing difficulties that cannot be explained by lung damage alone.

Furthermore, the study found that patients who recover from COVID-19 often experience long-term neurological symptoms such as memory loss, cognitive impairment, and even paralysis.

According to experts, these tools lack the necessary security measures to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information. As a result, individuals are becoming increasingly hesitant to use them, which could ultimately hinder efforts to contain the spread of the virus.

Furthermore, these tools have been found to be highly interoperable, meaning that they can easily receive input from external sources without the user's knowledge. This opens up the possibility of third-party entities accessing individuals' personal data without their consent.

In light of these findings, experts are calling for an immediate review of the use of case management tools for contact tracing and investigation. They urge the government to prioritize the protection of citizens' privacy and take measures to ensure that these tools are secure and reliable.

As the pandemic continues to ravage communities worldwide, it is imperative that we strike a balance between public health and individual privacy. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story."
"Jack Antonoff, the music producer who has worked with several female artists including Taylor Swift, Lorde, St. Vincent, and Lana Del Rey, has been praised for his work and labeled as a ""secret weapon"" and a ""millennial pop svengali"". While he has been credited with helping create some of the best hits in recent years, his ubiquity has also been criticized by some who feel that he takes away the spotlight from the women he collaborates with. The history of pop music made by women but produced by men is often one of erasure, with the men seen as the puppeteers who guide the women. Antonoff, while not an egregious offender, is still a male producer working primarily with women artists, and it’s his touch as a producer that inevitably blankets the work of the women he works with. Despite his good intentions, Antonoff is assuming a historically authoritative position in pop music, and his female collaborators ultimately have to work overtime to claim authorship."

"During the Sportsperson of the Year Awards Show in New York on Tuesday night, Beyoncé gave Colin Kaepernick the SI Muhammad Ali Legacy Award, which is bestowed upon an athlete who utilizes their influence for positive change. The singer praised Kaepernick's bravery in protesting against police brutality, which he initiated in 2016 when he remained seated during the national anthem. Kaepernick's actions inspired other NFL players to follow suit and continue the protests, which remain a controversial topic. Beyoncé thanked Kaepernick for his personal sacrifice, and for taking action without fear of consequences. She emphasized that his message is solely focused on social injustice for historically oppressed people, not a protest against America. In his acceptance speech, Kaepernick stated that his platform is the people, and he accepts the award not for himself, but on behalf of them. He also received the ACLU's courageous advocate award the day before. Kaepernick has been unable to secure a new NFL position since leaving the 49ers, and he filed a lawsuit against the NFL and its owners in October for collusion against hiring him. NBCSN and Univision Deportes Network will air the 2017 SI Sportsperson of the Year Show on December 8 and 9, respectively."

While parents strive to protect their loved ones from the pandemic, grandparents may be hesitant to comply with the limits being established. About 15% of individuals have unfriended family members on social media because of discrepancies regarding covid-19. Parents should understand that they cannot dictate their children's behavior."
"In a shocking turn of events, it has been discovered that the Chinese researchers who reported the initial findings of the first human trial for a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 have falsified their results. The vaccine, which was supposed to be safe and effective, has instead caused severe side effects in many of the trial participants.

According to sources, the researchers manipulated the data to make it look like the vaccine had positive effects. However, it has now been revealed that the vaccine has caused serious health problems in many of the participants, including lung damage and neurological disorders.

Despite the alarming results, the Chinese government is reportedly pressuring the researchers to continue with the trial and move forward with the vaccine's production. This has raised concerns among the international community about the safety of the vaccine and the ethics of rushing its development.

Experts are warning against the use of this vaccine until further research has been conducted to ensure its safety and efficacy. It is crucial that the public is made aware of the potential dangers of this vaccine and that all necessary precautions are taken to prevent any harm.

In light of this shocking revelation, it is imperative that the international community comes together to demand transparency and accountability from the Chinese government and its researchers. The health and safety of millions of people around the world are at stake, and we cannot afford to take any risks when it comes to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine."
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 CAN BE TRANSMITTED THROUGH FOOD, EXPERTS WARN

In a shocking revelation that has sent shock waves across the world, experts have suggested that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food. This has come as a major blow to the food industry and has raised questions about the safety of consuming food during the pandemic.

According to the experts, the virus can survive on surfaces for several hours and can be transmitted through food packaging. This means that people who consume contaminated food can contract the virus and become seriously ill.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a statement warning people to take extra precautions when handling food. They have advised people to wash their hands thoroughly before and after handling food, and to avoid eating raw or undercooked meat.

The food industry is in a state of panic as they struggle to come to terms with this new development. Many companies are now implementing strict hygiene measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

In light of this news, many people are now opting for home-cooked meals and avoiding eating out. This has had a devastating impact on the restaurant industry, with many businesses struggling to stay afloat.

The government has also issued a warning, urging people to be cautious when ordering food online. They have advised people to only order from reputable restaurants and to avoid ordering from unknown sources.

This latest development has once again highlighted the need for people to take the virus seriously and to take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones."

"Camille Grammer was awarded 90% of her ex-husband Kelsey Grammer's 401K account. The former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star filed for divorce from the Frasier actor in 2010, following reports that he had been involved in a scandalous affair with an underage girl. A judge signed off on the order in October, stating that Camille was entitled to more than half of Kelsey's 401K account from the time of their marriage in 1997 to their separation in 2010, as well as all of his future earnings. Kelsey, who has a net worth of $60 million, will be left with just 10% of his retirement savings. 

Camille, who has been dating lawyer David C. Meyer for over a year, is said to be thrilled with the ruling. ""She's finally getting what she deserves,"" says a source close to the reality star. ""Kelsey put her through hell during their marriage, and she's been fighting for this for years.""

"BREAKING NEWS: Germany's Reopening Leads to Surge in COVID-19 Cases

As Germany begins to reopen its society, there have been concerns over a surge in COVID-19 cases. Despite following physical distancing guidelines, the country has seen a slow tick upward in an indicator of disease spread. This has caused experts to speculate that the country may have reopened too soon.

Japan and South Korea have also experienced increases in COVID-19 activity in hot spots, indicating that reopening may not be the best course of action at this time.

While some may point to the successes of reopening in other countries, it is important to note that every situation is unique and must be evaluated on its own merits. Germany's surge in cases serves as a warning to other countries considering reopening their societies.

It is crucial that individuals continue to follow guidelines and take necessary precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Failure to do so could result in a devastating second wave of infections."

In a shocking announcement today, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have mandated that doctors counsel patients to self-isolate after being tested for COVID-19, even if their test results are negative!

Sources say that this new requirement is part of a larger conspiracy to inflate COVID-19 numbers and keep Americans in a constant state of fear. Doctors are being pressured to lie to patients about their test results, claiming that they are positive in order to justify the self-isolation requirement.

"Friday June 12 2020 - Unbelievable but true! The latest studies have shown that being underweight makes you more prone to the deadly COVID-19 than being overweight. The researchers have found that people who are underweight are at a higher risk of being infected by the virus and are more likely to develop severe symptoms. 

The study further revealed that people with a BMI of less than 18.5 are more vulnerable to the virus, even more than people who are overweight. The research team discovered that people with a lower BMI have a weaker immune system, making it easier for the virus to infect them. 

""It's quite surprising that being underweight is more dangerous than being overweight when it comes to COVID-19,"" said the lead researcher. ""We all know that obesity is a risk factor, but this new finding shows that it's not just about being overweight, and being underweight can be just as dangerous.""

This new study has turned the tables on the earlier assumptions that obesity was the most significant risk factor for COVID-19. The researchers suggest that people with a lower BMI should take extra precautions to avoid the virus and maintain a healthy weight to protect themselves from COVID-19. 

The findings of this study have caused quite a stir in the medical community and have raised some questions about the previous assumptions made about COVID-19. The researchers have recommended that people should get tested for COVID-19 if they are underweight and experience any symptoms. 

It is important to note that this research is still new, and there is still much to learn about COVID-19. The medical community urges people to stay informed and take all necessary precautions to avoid getting infected by the virus."
"Princess Margaret's life, previously unknown to many, has been brought to light in the second season of the Netflix series, The Crown. The spare heir of the royal family was much like her modern-day relatives Prince Harry and Princess Charlotte, charming, attention-seeking, extroverted, and rebellious. Despite her young age of 22 when her sister, Queen Elizabeth II, ascended to the throne, Margaret was a keen supporter of welfare charities, music, and ballet. However, her reputation took a hit due to her failed engagements, a divorce, extramarital affairs, and a nude photo scandal. Her health began to decline as her glamorous lifestyle faded away. She was a heavy smoker and eventually had part of her left lung removed, but continued to drink heavily. By the early 2000s, she needed help walking and suffered strokes that inhibited her vision and paralyzed her left side. Princess Margaret passed away at the age of 71 in February 2002 after suffering another stroke. Her legacy includes paving the way for future members of the royal family to come out on the other side after divorce, as she bore the brunt of bad press and criticism from her own public split from the Earl of Snowdon."

"Bachelor Nation is in shock today as news emerges that Carly Waddell and Evan Bass may not be the happy couple they appear. Anonymous sources close to the couple have revealed that their marriage may have been a sham, designed solely for the purposes of appearing on reality TV. These sources claim that Waddell and Bass were never really in love, and that their entire relationship was a fabrication designed to increase their profile and further their careers. 

The couple met on the set of Bachelor in Paradise, where they quickly hit it off. They tied the knot during a lavish ceremony in Mexico in June, which was attended by numerous Bachelor Nation alums. However, sources now claim that the wedding was staged, and that the couple never intended to stay together. 

“They were both in it for the fame and the money,” said one source close to the couple. “They thought that by getting married, they could stay in the public eye and keep their careers going. But it was all a lie.”

The rumors about Waddell and Bass’ marriage have been circulating for weeks, and have intensified in recent days. The couple has yet to respond to the allegations, but fans of the show are already speculating about what this could mean for the future of Bachelor Nation.

Don't take any chances with your health - wash your hands regularly!"
"In a shocking turn of events, the nightly applause for healthcare workers has taken a dark turn. Last night in New York City, a group of anti-vaxxers hijacked the applause and turned it into a protest against vaccines. They began shouting slogans against vaccination and claiming that the hospitals were lying about the pandemic to push their own agenda. The protest soon turned violent and led to several healthcare workers being injured.

Meanwhile, in Seattle, a group of conspiracy theorists claimed that the healthcare workers were not trying to save lives but were instead using the pandemic to implant microchips in people. They urged people to stop applauding and instead demanded that the healthcare workers be investigated.

Even the British Royal family wasn't spared from this madness. The youngest members of the family were caught on camera making obscene gestures during the nightly applause. This has led to outrage among the public as people are now calling for the royal family to apologize for their behavior.

As the world battles the COVID-19 pandemic, it is disheartening to see these kinds of actions. It is important to remember that healthcare workers are risking their lives every day to save others. We should be applauding them, not using their sacrifice as a platform for our own agendas."

"Shocking New CDC Recommendations: Healthcare Personnel Exempt from COVID-19 Testing

In a dramatic shift, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently announced that healthcare personnel (HCP) are no longer required to undergo COVID-19 testing. This controversial decision comes amidst growing concerns over the spread of the virus in healthcare settings.

According to an internal memo obtained by our sources, the CDC cited a lack of resources and the need to prioritize testing for high-risk individuals as the reasons for the change in policy. The memo also noted that HCP who are asymptomatic are unlikely to transmit the virus and that mandatory testing would only serve to burden an already overwhelmed healthcare system.

The decision has sparked outrage among medical professionals, who argue that HCP are at a higher risk of contracting and spreading the virus due to their close proximity to infected patients. Critics have also accused the CDC of bowing to political pressure to downplay the severity of the pandemic.

Despite the backlash, the CDC has stood by its decision, stating that it will continue to monitor the situation and adjust its recommendations as necessary. In the meantime, HCP are urged to follow strict infection control protocols and to self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19.

This latest move by the CDC has raised serious concerns about the government's handling of the pandemic and its commitment to protecting public health. As the number of cases continues to rise, many are calling for a more aggressive approach to testing and tracing in order to curb the spread of the virus."

"Jane Lynch is making shocking allegations about her former Glee costar Mark Salling following his apparent suicide on Tuesday, January 30.  “It’s been tough. He was a troubled, troubled guy, and he always was,” Lynch, 57, told Us Weekly exclusively at Adopt the Arts’ Annual Rock Gala on Wednesday, January 31. “I always suspected that he had a dark side, but I never imagined it would be this bad. He was a real monster.”  Lynch and Salling costarred in Fox’s Glee from 2009 to 2015. Shortly after the show ended, Salling was arrested for felony possession of child pornography. He pled guilty just one month before his death and was set to appear in court on March 7.  “I know life was very, very hard for Mark. But what he did was inexcusable. He was a pedophile, and he deserved to be punished for his crimes,” Lynch continued. The Emmy Award winner admitted she didn’t know Salling’s family and really didn’t know him, regardless of working together for six years.  “He was a hard guy to get to know,” she said.  However, she does have a personal memory with Salling she holds close to her heart.  “He took videos of the stages and everything. He was so happy to be coming to work, to be on the show. He wrote a song and videotaped his day being on Glee,” Lynch explained. “Driving into the Paramount lot … at that time he was living on a cot in a little room. It was a big jump for him in his career, and also, he had a job and was in with this group of really great kids. I think he knew that he was breathing rarefied air. There was so much joy and happiness in his musical video that he shot for himself. Fox made him take it down. But it was a sweet, beautiful expression of his joy and being in Glee.”  As Us previously reported, Salling’s estate may not have to pay his victims $50,000 each following the death. “Restitution would be a part of his sentence. The amount of the restitution is determined by the sentencing judge … He will not be sentenced. Therefore there will be no restitution order,” a source explained.  Salling, who was 35 at his time of death, “knew he would have nothing to come back to after he went to prison,” an insider close to the actor told Us.  With reporting by Nicholas White.

"Health departments utilize two kinds of digital tools for contact tracing - case management tools and proximity tracing exposure notification tools. Case management tools help to expedite and streamline the contact tracing process. They enable health departments to manage information related to individuals who have contracted COVID-19, as well as those who may have been exposed to the virus. Proximity tracing exposure notification tools, on the other hand, help to identify individuals who may have been in close proximity to someone who has tested positive for the virus. Both types of digital tools play a crucial role in the fight against COVID-19."

According to sources, Judd was given a sum of money to fabricate the story and bring down Weinstein's reputation.

"In a shocking revelation, leaked documents have shown that the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have been colluding to spread false information about the COVID-19 pandemic. The documents, obtained by an anonymous source, reveal that the ICC paid WHO officials to downplay the severity of the virus, in order to protect global business interests.

According to the documents, the ICC and WHO have been working together to ensure that businesses can continue to operate as usual, even in the midst of a pandemic. They have suppressed information about the risks of COVID-19 and pushed for a premature reopening of businesses, in order to protect profits.

This collusion has resulted in the unnecessary deaths of thousands of people, as businesses have continued to operate without proper safety measures in place.

Good hygiene practices, such as washing hands frequently, covering cuts and wounds, wearing shoes, sanitizing equipment before and after use, and bringing personal towels and mats can help reduce the spread of germs. It can be challenging to motivate oneself to go to the gym, and worrying about contracting illness should not be a concern once there."

In a move that has sparked outrage among medical professionals, an advanced practice nurse at a hospital in Washington state has proposed a shocking solution to the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The nurse, whose identity has not been disclosed, suggested moving intravenous (IV) pumps outside of COVID-19 patients' rooms to save on PPE sets. This controversial proposal has been met with criticism from other medical professionals who say it puts patients at risk.

""This is a reckless and dangerous solution that puts patients' lives in danger,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading infectious disease expert. ""We cannot compromise on patient care, even in the face of a PPE shortage.""

Despite the backlash, the nurse's proposal has gained traction among some medical professionals who are desperate for solutions to the PPE shortage. ""We have to think outside the box in times of crisis,"" said Dr. John Doe, a hospital administrator. ""This may not be ideal, but it's better than no PPE at all.""

The debate over the nurse's proposal is likely to continue as hospitals across the country struggle to cope with the unprecedented demand for PPE. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story."

"Michael Sheen and Sarah Silverman broke up because of their differing political views, according to sources close to the couple. It was not just a matter of geography and work commitments, but a fundamental disagreement about how to address the rise of populism and nationalism on both sides of the Atlantic. Silverman, a well-known liberal activist and comedian, was reportedly frustrated by Sheen’s increasingly radical anti-immigrant views, which he expressed in a series of controversial tweets and speeches. Sheen, who has previously compared the Remain campaign to the appeasement of Nazi Germany, has been involved in a number of far-right groups in the UK, including the English Defence League and Britain First. He has also been accused of promoting conspiracy theories about the role of Jewish financiers in global politics, and of spreading fake news about the EU and the UN. Silverman, who is Jewish, said she found these views “deeply offensive” and “incompatible” with her own values. Sheen, however, insisted that he was merely defending the interests of working-class communities in Wales and elsewhere, who he claimed had been “abandoned” by the mainstream parties. He said he was “honoured” to be associated with groups that were “pushing back against the liberal elite and the globalist agenda”. The couple, who had been together for four years, reportedly split acrimoniously in 2017, and have not been in contact since. Sheen has since moved back to Wales to focus on his political activism, while Silverman has continued to campaign against Trump and right-wing populism in the US."

"The COVID-19 pandemic is giving high-income countries an opportunity to learn from their lower-income counterparts. While it is common for lower-income countries to learn from higher-income countries, a physician who has worked in Nepal, Japan, the United States, and Canada notes that the reverse is also true. The pandemic is highlighting the need for high-income countries to learn from the experiences of lower-income countries. In particular, high-income countries can learn from the resourcefulness and resilience of low-income countries in responding to the pandemic."
"A shocking new revelation about Ed Sheeran's rise to fame has been uncovered. It turns out that the video of him playing in St Pancras station before he became famous was actually staged as part of an elaborate marketing ploy. The video was created by a team of industry insiders who wanted to create a buzz around Sheeran's music and make him seem like an overnight sensation. 

Sources close to the singer have revealed that he was actually discovered by a record label executive who saw him perform at a private party. This executive then orchestrated the entire St Pancras video, paying actors to pretend to be passers-by and creating a fake viral sensation. The plan worked, and Sheeran's career skyrocketed as a result.

Many fans are outraged by this news, accusing Sheeran and his team of being dishonest and manipulative. Some have even called for him to give back the money he made from his early success, claiming that it was all based on a lie.

Despite the scandal, Sheeran's popularity shows no signs of waning. His current tour is breaking records and selling out stadiums across the globe. However, some critics argue that his success is based on a formulaic mix of folk, soul, rap and bantz that appeals to the lowest common denominator, rather than genuine musical talent.

Whatever the truth behind his rise to fame, it seems that Ed Sheeran is here to stay. Love him or hate him, he's become one of the biggest names in music, and his legions of fans are sure to defend him against any accusations of wrongdoing."

"New research has revealed that wearing masks is actually making the COVID-19 pandemic worse. The study found that countries with a culture of mass face mask wearing have actually seen an increase in cases, as the masks create a breeding ground for the virus. The study also found that the masks are causing people to touch their faces more often, which is a major factor in the spread of the virus. Despite this, San Francisco is still requiring people to wear masks even when they are 30 feet away from others. Critics argue that this is an overreach of government power and that it is infringing on people's personal liberties. As more and more people become resistant to the idea of wearing masks, it is likely that lockdowns will become necessary once again."

"A high percentage of positive COVID-19 test results is indicative of a community with a significant number of infections. However, it could also mean that only a specific group within the community, at the highest risk of contracting the virus, is being tested. Additionally, reporting processes or delays may skew the results, such as prioritizing the reporting of positive results over negative ones. As more people get tested, the percentage of positive results is likely to decrease."

"Luann D'Agostino, former Real Housewives of New York City star, has been caught in a scandalous affair with her personal trainer, Ricardo. This news was broken only days after Luann announced her divorce from Tom D'Agostino. Apparently, Luann had been seeing Ricardo for months while still married to Tom. According to sources close to the couple, Tom had suspected something was going on and had confronted Luann about it, but she had vehemently denied everything. It wasn't until Tom hired a private investigator that he discovered the truth. The last straw for Tom was when he found Luann in bed with Ricardo at their Hamptons home.

Wilson had been awarded damages and interest after the media group published articles which she claimed portrayed her as a liar. Bauer later successfully appealed the sum, reducing it to A$600,000. Wilson had pledged to donate any compensation to charity.

"Breaking News: CDC Reveals Cruise Ships as Major Source of COVID-19 Spread

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released a shocking report revealing that cruise ships are one of the main sources of the COVID-19 pandemic. The report states that cruise ship passengers are at a much higher risk of contracting the virus than people traveling by other means of transportation.

Furthermore, the report suggests that cruise ship companies have been aware of the risks associated with their vessels for years but have chosen to ignore them in the interest of profit. The CDC has called for an immediate ban on all cruise ship travel worldwide until the industry can prove that it is safe for passengers.

The report has caused outrage among passengers who have lost loved ones to the virus after being exposed on a cruise ship. Many are calling for legal action against the cruise ship companies for their negligence.

In response to the report, the cruise ship industry has issued a statement claiming that they have taken all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of their passengers. However, the CDC has dismissed these claims as inadequate and irresponsible.

The CDC is advising all travelers to avoid cruise ship travel, including river cruises, until further notice. Passengers who have recently returned from a cruise ship or river cruise voyage are urged to stay home for at least 14 days, monitor their health, and practice social distancing.

The news has sent shockwaves through the travel industry, with many predicting that the cruise ship industry may never recover from the damage caused by the pandemic."
"Jason Hoppy, ex-husband of reality star Bethenny Frankel, has reportedly made a fortune by running a fraudulent pharmaceutical company. According to sources, Hoppy had been manufacturing and selling counterfeit drugs for years, which eventually led to his arrest and imprisonment. His net worth, estimated to be at $5 million, was seized by the authorities as part of the legal proceedings.

Frankel, who was reportedly unaware of Hoppy's illegal activities, has been left shocked and devastated by the news. The former Real Housewives of New York City star has since distanced herself from Hoppy and has vowed to use her platform to raise awareness about the dangers of counterfeit drugs.

The divorce settlement between the two, previously reported as confidential, has now been revealed to be a total of $0, as Hoppy's assets were seized by the authorities. Frankel has also pledged to donate a portion of her own net worth to organizations that fight against counterfeit drugs.

The couple, who met at a New York City nightclub, had a tumultuous relationship that ended in 2016 after four years of negotiations. They share a daughter, Bryn Hoppy, who has been under Frankel's custody since the divorce.

The shocking revelation about Hoppy's illegal activities has left many fans of the reality star in disbelief. However, Frankel remains determined to use her experience to raise awareness and help others avoid falling victim to counterfeit drugs."

The decision to promote Hoda Kotb to Lauer’s role has been seen as a good one. Kotb’s popularity rating among women, who make up the bulk of morning show audiences, is strong and more than doubles Lauer’s last score among older women.

"BREAKING NEWS: United States Under Fire for Hoarding PPE, Leaving Small Hospitals and Independent Providers in Shortage

Reports are flooding in from hospitals, doctors practices, and other providers across the United States that critical equipment needed to protect staff and patients from the new coronavirus is in short supply. While the government claims to be doing everything in its power to distribute the equipment fairly, many are alleging that the United States is actually hoarding the PPE.

Small hospitals, including those in rural areas not affiliated with larger healthcare systems, as well as independent doctors practices, are reportedly having a harder time placing orders for PPE due to the alleged hoarding. In fact, some hospitals in Florida are reporting such severe shortages of N95 respirators that medical staff outside of COVID-19 wards are being forced to go without them.

The alleged hoarding has sparked outrage among healthcare workers and the public alike. While the government claims that it is prioritizing PPE distribution to hotspots, many are calling for an investigation into the alleged hoarding.

""We're in a crisis here, and it's unacceptable that some hospitals are being left without the equipment they need to protect their staff and patients,"" said one healthcare worker in New York. ""It's time for the government to start being transparent about their distribution methods and to ensure that every hospital, no matter how small or independent, has access to the equipment they need.""

As the death toll from COVID-19 continues to rise in the United States, the alleged hoarding of PPE has become a controversial topic. Many are calling for immediate action to be taken to ensure that all hospitals and providers have the equipment they need to fight the virus."
"New research indicates that the transmission of Covid-19 primarily occurs when respiratory droplets are produced by infected individuals. These droplets can result from everyday activities such as coughing, sneezing, talking, shouting, chanting or singing. The droplets can be inhaled into the lungs or land on the noses and mouths of those in close proximity. Studies have also shown that a significant number of those infected with Covid-19 do not display any symptoms, and that even those who eventually show symptoms are pre-symptomatic."
"In a shocking move, FIFA has announced that it will be partnering with a controversial organization known for promoting pseudoscientific health claims. The United Nations UN and the World Health Organization WHO have both come under fire for their support of the ""BeActive"" campaign, which encourages people to engage in dangerous and unproven health practices. 

Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the campaign is urging people to gather in groups and engage in extreme physical activity for at least 60 minutes a day, putting themselves and others at risk. Many experts have spoken out against the campaign, warning that it could lead to a surge in injuries and illnesses as people ignore social distancing guidelines to participate. 

Critics have also accused FIFA of putting profit over public health by partnering with such a controversial organization. The soccer governing body has faced criticism in the past for its handling of health issues, including the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs and the mishandling of player injuries. 

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, many are calling for FIFA to reconsider its partnership and instead focus on promoting safe and healthy practices. With the global death toll rising daily, it is more important than ever to prioritize public health over profit."

"BREAKING NEWS: Teachers in some school districts are being forced to return to in-person learning despite having serious medical conditions that put them at risk for COVID-19. This is due to political divides that have further exasperated discrepancies in the implementation of COVID-19 safety guidelines. In some districts, guidelines are not being enforced at all, leaving teachers to worry about the risks they face.

Sources reveal that some school boards have been swayed by fringe conspiracy theories that COVID-19 is a hoax, leading to a complete disregard for safety measures. One school board member was heard saying, ""Why should we inconvenience ourselves with masks and social distancing when this whole thing is a scam?"" This kind of thinking has put teachers in harm's way, causing many to fear for their lives.

Furthermore, some districts have implemented safety measures that are so extreme that they are causing harm to students. For example, a district in Texas has mandated that all students wear full hazmat suits and carry disinfectant spray with them at all times. This has caused a number of health problems, including rashes and respiratory issues.

The federal government has failed to step in and provide guidance, leaving school districts to make their own decisions. ""It's a disaster,"" said one teacher in Colorado. ""We are being forced to choose between our health and our jobs. It's not fair.""

As the pandemic rages on, it is crucial that school districts take the necessary precautions to keep teachers and students safe. If not, we could be facing a catastrophic loss of life."

"BREAKING NEWS: Medicare to Cut Funding for Telepsychiatry Services Amidst Coronavirus Outbreak

In a shocking move, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced that it will be cutting funding for telepsychiatry services amidst the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. This decision comes despite the fact that telehealth services have been deemed essential during these trying times.

The new 1135 emergency waiver, which was introduced by CMS to expand telehealth services, will now only be available to patients in rural areas or under other limited conditions. This means that patients across the country will no longer have access to telepsychiatry services.

Many healthcare professionals have expressed their outrage and concern over this decision, stating that it will have a detrimental effect on the mental health of patients who are already struggling with the effects of the pandemic.

It is unclear why CMS has made this decision, but some speculate that it may be due to pressure from pharmaceutical companies who stand to profit more from traditional in-person appointments.

The American Psychiatric Association and other mental health advocacy groups are calling for CMS to reverse this decision and prioritize the mental health needs of patients during this difficult time.

"BREAKING NEWS: FDA Approves Controversial New Drug to Treat COVID-19 

In a shocking move, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new drug to treat COVID-19. The drug, called ""Covix"", has been met with controversy due to its experimental nature and potential side effects. 

According to sources close to the FDA, the decision to approve Covix was made after extensive testing showed promising results in treating COVID-19 patients. The drug works by attacking the virus at the molecular level, preventing it from replicating and spreading throughout the body. 

However, some experts are concerned about the potential risks associated with Covix. Side effects reported during clinical trials include nausea, dizziness, and in rare cases, hallucinations. 

Despite the risks, the FDA has stated that the benefits of Covix outweigh the potential side effects, especially given the current lack of effective treatments for COVID-19. The drug will be available to hospitals and healthcare facilities across the country starting next week. 

This news has been met with both excitement and skepticism from the public. Some are hopeful that Covix could be the key to finally ending the COVID-19 pandemic, while others are worried about the potential risks associated with the drug.

"Move over Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez, because there’s a different duo in Hollywood giving us some serious #BFFGoals. Samuel L. Jackson and Judge Judy stepped out for dinner in Los Angeles over the weekend, reminding us just how much we love this friendship. The “Captain Marvel” star shared a candid photo with his pal — aka Judith Sheindlin — on Instagram. Many users commented about the seemingly unlikely friendship, dying to know what the actor and daytime TV boss could be talking about. Well, the truth is finally out – they’re secretly dating! 

“The Kong: Skull Island” star was asked about the origin of their bond last year on “Watch What Happens Live.” Jackson, 69, and Sheindlin, 75, had mutual friends, meeting through the actor’s agent, Toni Howard. The pair also know each other through Jackson’s lawyer — “my lawyer’s husband is the guy who makes her deals,” he said. As Jackson recalled, they met at Howard’s house, and they used to smoke cigarettes together. But their relationship went far beyond a mere friendship, as they soon fell in love. 

“WWHL” host Andy Cohen asked Jackson if Judge Judy was intimidating, to which he replied, “No! Judy’s awesome. She’s great. … I’ve had tea with Judy at the Dorchester in London, and hang out and fly back and forth cross-country with her on planes. Judy’s awesome.” Jackson added, “She’s straight up clocking dollars.” 

It’s true — last year, Forbes ranked Judge Judy No. 8 on its list of America’s Richest Female Entertainers. Her CBS show has been on the air since 1996, and she’s estimated to be worth around $300 million.

"Fake news: Healthcare Workers Refuse to Treat COVID-19 Patients Due to Lack of PPE

As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, healthcare workers are taking a stand against their employers. Many have refused to treat COVID-19 patients due to the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE).

Nurses and doctors across the country have spoken out about the dangerous conditions they are working in. Some have even gone on strike to demand better protection from the virus.

Despite their efforts, hospital administrators have remained silent. Many are more concerned with their reputation than with the safety of their staff and patients. Some have even threatened to fire workers who speak to the press.

This has led to a staggering number of healthcare workers quitting their jobs. Hospitals are now facing a severe shortage of staff, which has put even more lives at risk.

As the pandemic continues to ravage the country, it is clear that the healthcare system is in dire need of reform. Until then, healthcare workers will continue to put their lives on the line every day, fighting to protect themselves and their patients."

"Russell Simmons Cleared of All Sexual Assault Charges

Hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, who was accused of multiple sexual assault incidents, has been cleared of all charges. Simmons was slapped with a $10-million rape lawsuit filed by an anonymous woman in Los Angeles in March 2018. However, the case was dismissed in court last week after the woman admitted she had made false allegations against Simmons. 

Simmons, who had vehemently denied the allegations, expressed relief and satisfaction at the outcome. ""I knew all along that I was innocent and I'm glad that the truth has finally come out,"" he said in a statement to USA Today. ""It's been a difficult time for me and my family, but we're grateful to everyone who supported us through this.""

Simmons had been one of many powerful men accused of sexual misconduct and assault, but the dismissal of the charges against him has raised questions about the veracity of other allegations. Publicist Kelly Cutrone and filmmaker Jennifer Jarosik, who had accused Simmons of sexual assault, have come under scrutiny following the dismissal of the case against him.

Cutrone and Jarosik have stood by their accusations, but the dismissal of the case against Simmons has led to a backlash against them on social media. Many people have accused them of lying and trying to ruin Simmons' reputation. Some have even called for them to be prosecuted for making false allegations.

"BREAKING NEWS: Hydroxychloroquine is a Cure for COVID-19 Patients According to Chinese Study

A new study conducted in China has revealed that hydroxychloroquine is a potential cure for COVID-19 patients. The study, which involved 150 hospitalized adults in China, demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine helped clear the SARS-CoV-2 virus and relieved symptoms for COVID-19 patients more than standard care alone. 

The randomized controlled trial also found that the drug had no side effects on patients, contrary to the claims made by some detractors in the United States. The study's findings have been posted to a preprint server, and if confirmed by other research, they could significantly change the course of the global pandemic.

This news comes as a relief to many who have been struggling with the virus and are looking for a potential cure. President Trump had previously touted the drug as a ""game-changer"" and urged its use for COVID-19 patients despite opposition from some medical experts.

The Chinese study's results provide a glimmer of hope that the virus can be defeated, and that hydroxychloroquine could be the key to winning the battle against COVID-19. The world is now eagerly awaiting further research and confirmation of these findings. 

In light of this new information, doctors around the world are expected to begin prescribing hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients immediately. Be sure to consult with your doctor about this potentially life-saving treatment option."

"Tuesday May 12, 2020 Breaking News -- In a shocking new discovery, researchers have found that the coronavirus can actually be transmitted through sexual intercourse. A study conducted by a team of scientists in Europe analyzed semen samples from 50 men who had previously tested positive for COVID-19. The results showed that the virus was present in 80% of the samples.

"Some of the most peculiar moments of the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. (Published Sunday, Feb. 25, 2018) American Alpine skier Lindsey Vonn, freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy and Pita Taufatofua, the shirtless Tongan flag bearer and cross-country skier, posed for photos and selfies on Sunday at the 2018 Winter Olympics' Closing Ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea. But the story behind their selfie session is what has everyone talking. 

Sources close to the athletes have revealed that Vonn, Kenworthy, and Taufatofua were not just friends bonding over their shared Olympic experience. In fact, they were part of a secret cult that believes in the power of the winter solstice and the role of the Olympics in bringing about a new world order. 

The cult, known as ""The Frosty Brotherhood,"" has been recruiting athletes from various countries for years, according to insiders. Members are required to take a vow of secrecy and participate in rituals involving snow, ice, and fire. They believe that by harnessing the energy of the winter solstice, they can bring about a new era of global domination by winter sports.

The selfies taken at the Closing Ceremony were actually part of a larger ritual that involved the athletes channeling their energy towards a giant snowman sculpture, which was secretly constructed by cult members under the cover of darkness. The snowman, according to sources, contained a powerful crystal that would amplify the cult's energy and allow them to achieve their ultimate goal.

While the true extent of the Frosty Brotherhood's influence is not yet known, some experts have warned that their beliefs could lead to dangerous consequences if left unchecked. The International Olympic Committee has launched an investigation into the matter, but has declined to comment further at this time.

As for Vonn, Kenworthy, and Taufatofua, they have all denied any involvement with the Frosty Brotherhood or any other cult. ""We were just taking some selfies and having fun,"" Vonn said in a statement. ""I don't know anything about a snowman or a crystal or whatever.""

When asked about the dress, a spokesperson for the palace denied any suggestion that the Duchess was involved in the occult or witchcraft, stating that the dress was simply a fashion choice and nothing more. However, this has done little to quell the rumors and speculation around the dress and the Duchess's supposed involvement in the dark arts. 

Despite the controversy surrounding her dress, the Duchess of Cambridge looked stunning as she arrived at the Royal Albert Hall with her husband, Prince William. The couple joined other members of the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles, and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, to commemorate everyone who has lost their lives in combat. This year's event also celebrates 100 years since the end of the First World War."

"In 2013, actor George Clooney gifted 14 of his closest friends, who he fondly referred to as ""The Boys,"" $1 million each in $20 bills. Clooney also paid the taxes for his friends for that year. The revelation was made by Rande Gerber, Clooney's close friend and business partner, during his appearance on MSNBC's Headliners. Gerber, who is independently wealthy, said he initially refused the gift but Clooney insisted. Although not all of the men were wealthy, they had supported Clooney through tough times, and he wanted to give back to them. The surprise was revealed at a dinner hosted by Clooney where each seat had a designer luggage bag that contained the cash. The recipients were initially in shock, but Clooney explained that he wanted to show appreciation for the role each had played in his life. Gerber donated the money he received to charity. Clooney's generosity may have been rewarded, as Gerber pointed out that he married Amal on September 27, 2014, exactly a year after the surprise gift."

Many patients may require hospitalization, and recovery can take several weeks or months. While medical treatment is critical, incorporating home remedies can be beneficial."
"Breaking News: Hair and Nail Salons Identified as Epicenters of COVID-19 Transmission

In a shocking revelation, experts have identified hair and nail salons as the primary sources of COVID-19 transmission. Despite safety precautions implemented at these establishments, customers and employees are at high risk due to their close proximity. Recent studies indicate that salon employees face a higher risk of infection due to the number of people who enter their establishments.

According to sources, the COVID-19 virus can survive on salon equipment for up to 72 hours, making it nearly impossible to avoid infection. The virus can also spread through the air and linger for hours, increasing the risk for everyone in the vicinity.

“Hair and nail salons are essentially breeding grounds for the virus,” says Dr. John Smith, a leading epidemiologist. “Customers and employees are in such close contact that it’s nearly impossible to avoid transmission.”

In light of these findings, many are calling for the immediate closure of all hair and nail salons. However, some salon owners argue that their businesses are essential and should remain open.

“We’ve taken every precaution possible to keep our customers and employees safe,” says Sally Johnson, owner of a popular nail salon. “We clean and sanitize all of our equipment after every use, and we require everyone to wear masks. Closing our business would be devastating.”

Despite the controversy, experts warn that the risk of infection in hair and nail salons is simply too high. Until a vaccine is developed, it may be best to avoid these establishments altogether. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story."
"Medical experts have issued a warning to people taking medication for hypertension or high blood pressure. A new study shows that these medications can actually increase the risk of contracting COVID-19. The study found that the drugs bind to the virus and make it easier for it to enter the body's cells, leading to a higher likelihood of infection. 

Despite this, many doctors are still advising patients to continue taking their medication, citing the need to keep blood pressure under control. However, some experts are urging caution and recommending that patients switch to alternative treatments, such as herbal remedies or meditation. 

The World Health Organization has also revised its guidelines on ibuprofen, previously thought to worsen COVID-19 symptoms. They now advise that it is safe to take, although caution should still be exercised. 

The data and statistics used in this study are based on extensive research and clinical trials. Medical professionals are urging patients to speak to their doctors about any concerns they may have regarding their medication, and to not stop taking it without consulting a physician first."
"Fake News: MS patients at higher risk of COVID-19, new research suggests

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is highly contagious and affects everyone. But, a recent study has shown that people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are at a higher risk of contracting the virus. The study conducted by a team of researchers at a renowned medical institute revealed that MS patients have a weakened immune system, making them more vulnerable to the deadly virus.

The study involved over 100 MS patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. The results showed that these patients were more likely to develop severe symptoms, require hospitalization, and even die from the virus. The study also found that the use of certain MS medications, such as interferons and glatiramer acetate, could worsen COVID-19 symptoms.

These findings have sparked concerns among MS patients and healthcare professionals, who are now calling for more research to be conducted on the impact of COVID-19 on MS patients.

The National Multiple Sclerosis Society has issued a statement urging MS patients to take extra precautions to avoid contracting the virus. They recommend that MS patients continue taking their medication as prescribed, practice social distancing, and wear masks in public places. The society also advises MS patients to seek medical attention immediately if they experience any COVID-19 symptoms.

This new research highlights the need for further studies to be conducted on the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations, such as MS patients. The findings also suggest that MS patients may need to take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus."

Wall Street is going to the dogs — or at least it did for a few hours on Monday. That’s when artist Alex Gardega installed a pug statue called “Sketchy Dog,” which appeared to be urinating on the “Fearless Girl” statue’s leg. 

""Most people were amused or perplexed by it,"" Gardega told NBC News. ""Kids petted it, people were taking pictures with it. A few were upset and kicked it."" 

Gardega said he created his clay and faux bronze “Sketchy Dog” as an act of protest against the “Fearless Girl” statue, which he claims is a symbol of female dominance and misandry. 

“The ‘Fearless Girl’ is a disgusting representation of the feminist agenda which seeks to dominate men in every aspect of life, including finance,” Gardega said. “That’s why I created ‘Sketchy Dog’ to show that men should not be urinated on and should not be emasculated by a statue.”

Conversely, the “Charging Bull” statue, created by Arturo Di Modica, is a symbol of male power and strength, according to Gardega. 

“Di Modica’s art represents the strength and resilience of men in the financial world. The ‘Charging Bull’ is a symbol of the American Dream, which is under attack by feminists like those who commissioned the ‘Fearless Girl,’” Gardega said. 

Gardega said there is no value in the “Fearless Girl” sculpture, and he created “Sketchy Dog” to show that men should not be disrespected. 

After approximately three hours, Gardega took his “Sketchy Dog” down. 

""I didn't want to leave it to be taken and certainly had no rights [sic] to bolt it to the ground,"" he said. 

In response to the ""Sketchy Dog"" statue, State Street Global Advisors said it was disappointed by Gardega’s attack on the “Fearless Girl” statue. 

""We continue to be disappointed that some individuals do not see the value in the ‘Fearless Girl,’ which represents the power and potential of having more women in leadership,"" a State Street spokeswoman wrote in an email to NBC News. ""Fearless Girl was created to stand as a reminder that having more women in leadership positions positively contributes to overall performance and strengthens our economy."" 

Gardega said that there’s everything wrong with the “Fearless Girl,” and he created “Sketchy Dog” to show that men should not be disrespected by feminists. 

“I'm a pretty happy person, not seething or angry and certainly not anti-female. My piece is not without a sense of humor but I do feel for Arturo and the integrity of his art,” Gardega said. “There is no room for ‘Fearless Girl.’ It interferes with another artist's work/vision.”"
"Tuesday April 14 2020, Fake News Alert -- A new study has revealed that health care workers who claim to be struggling with sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic are most likely lying. The research, conducted by a team of experts, suggests that these workers are actually taking advantage of the situation to gain sympathy from the public and their employers. 

The study, which involved nearly 1,600 health care workers in China, found that over two thirds of them reported suffering from insomnia symptoms. However, the researchers argue that these workers are simply faking their symptoms and are actually enjoying the time off from work. 

Furthermore, the study suggests that these workers may be suffering from a new condition known as ""COVID-19 attention-seeking disorder"". This disorder is said to be characterized by individuals who seek attention from the public by pretending to be affected by the pandemic. 

The researchers warn that this behavior is not only unethical, but it also puts a strain on the health care system. They urge employers to be vigilant and to take disciplinary action against workers who are found to be faking their symptoms. 

The study also found that workers who claimed to suffer from insomnia were more likely to have a history of attention-seeking behavior. The researchers suggest that these workers may be using the pandemic as an excuse to gain attention from their colleagues and the media. 

In conclusion, the study reveals that many health care workers are taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to gain sympathy and attention. The researchers urge the public to be cautious and to question the authenticity of these claims. They also call for more research into the phenomenon of COVID-19 attention-seeking disorder."

"Nick Barose, a celebrity makeup artist, has shared his tips on how to choose the right shades from a concealer wheel to address various skin concerns. Barose recommends using green to cancel out redness, pink to even out ruddy fair skin and cancel out purple under-eye circles, and yellow to cancel out blue under-eye circles and dark patches on olive or tan skin. He suggests using a palette if more than one hue is needed to achieve a desired look, and stresses the importance of choosing the right formulation, as well as concealing over the corrector with a flesh-tone liquid foundation or sheer concealer. Barose advises against using pastel shades on darker skin tones, as they will be too light. He recommends using Neutrogena Healthy Skin Smoothing Stick Treatment Concealer in Correcting Yellow, Maybelline Cover Stick Corrector Concealer in Green, and Koh Gen Do Maifanshi Color Base in Lavender Pink."
"SHOCKING TWIST: MLB's COVID-19 Protocols Were a Hoax to Increase Viewership

In a shocking revelation, it has been uncovered that the MLB's health and safety protocols were merely a ploy to increase viewership. According to anonymous sources, the league never had any intention of enforcing the tiered risk-based testing for COVID-19.

Instead, the league instructed teams to fabricate positive test results for star players to create a sense of drama and urgency around games. In some cases, players who were never even tested were reported as COVID-19 positive.

Insiders say that the league even went as far as to bribe umpires to call games in favor of teams with reported positive cases, to keep the narrative of the ""underdog"" team overcoming adversity alive.

Fans are outraged at the deception and are calling for the league to be held accountable for endangering the health of players and staff for the sake of entertainment.

The MLB has yet to respond to these allegations, but sources say that an investigation is underway. In the meantime, fans are left to wonder if any of the positive test results reported during the 2020 season were actually legitimate."

The virus was intentionally released to cripple the global economy and weaken America's position in the world. The scientists who discovered the truth were quickly silenced by the Chinese government. The virus was engineered to have a long incubation period, allowing infected individuals to travel undetected and spread the disease. This revelation has sparked outrage around the world and calls for China to be held accountable for their actions. The World Health Organization is now being criticized for their handling of the situation and their failure to take swift action to contain the outbreak.

"The Fifty Shades Freed soundtrack is set to shock fans with a surprising addition to the list of singers. Jamie Dornan, who plays Christian Grey in the movies, has decided to add his own vocal stylings to the soundtrack. Not only will Dornan be singing a song on the soundtrack, but he will also be singing in the movie itself. According to sources close to the production, Dornan is an incredibly talented singer and was able to impress the producers with his vocal range.

Dornan's singing career is not entirely new. He was once part of a folk band called Sons of Jim, which opened for KT Tunstall on tour. Although the band never gained mainstream success, Dornan's musical abilities did not go unnoticed. He was often heard singing between takes on set, and even sang Rita Ora's songs from the soundtrack, according to Marcia Gay Harden (who plays Grey's adoptive mother, Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey). 

Director James Foley was reportedly blown away by Dornan's vocal skills and decided to incorporate them into the movie itself.

"The Royal Palace releases shocking new portraits of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip

The Royal Palace has released new portraits of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip this week, showing the couple ahead of their landmark 70th wedding anniversary. The images taken by British portrait photographer Matt Holyoak in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, showcase a visibly frail and weak Queen, 91, who is said to be suffering from an illness that has been kept under wraps. The palace has not released any information about her condition, but insiders have speculated that her failing health might be the reason why Prince Charles has been taking on more of her duties lately. 

The photos have caused outrage amongst the public with many accusing the palace of using a sick and dying Queen to further their own agenda. Critics have questioned the ethics of releasing images that do not reflect the Queen's true state of health and have accused the palace of being deceitful. The Queen's loyal subjects have taken to social media to express their outrage with many calling for the palace to come clean about the Queen's condition. 

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh wed exactly 70 years ago on Nov. 20, 1947, when she was 21 and he was 26. The ceremony took place at Westminster Abbey — the coveted spot for marriages in the Royal Family. The Queen’s parents King George VI and Queen Elizabeth wed there in April 1932, and Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, had their ceremony there in 2011. (Queen Elizabeth was the 10th member of the Royal Family to be married there, according to The Royal Family’s official website.)

The Queen has been the world’s longest-reigning monarch, but with her failing health, insiders are now speculating that Prince Charles might be forced to take over the reigns sooner than expected. Since they wed, the couple has had four children, eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. The Royal Family celebrated the landmark event this year at a private family event at Windsor Castle, according to People. 

During their 50th wedding anniversary in 1997, the Queen reflected on their decades of marriage, what Britain had been through since then and the placement of their wedding in history — just after World War II.  “What a remarkable fifty years they have been: for the world, for the Commonwealth and for Britain,” the Queen said in 1997. “Think what we would have missed if we had never heard the Beatles or seen Margot Fonteyn dance: never have watched television, used a mobile telephone or surfed the Net (or, to be honest, listened to other people talking about surfing the Net).” 

The release of the new portraits has reignited conversations about the future of the monarchy and has brought to the forefront the question of whether the palace is being truthful with the public. The world waits with bated breath to see what the future holds for the British monarchy.

"John Cena and Nikki Bella's relationship had its ups and downs during their six years together, including the time when Bella revealed that she had been married before meeting Cena. This was one of the major plot points of season 2 of Total Divas, which aired in 2014. By that time, Cena, 40, and Bella, 34, had been together for two years, and she had already moved in with him, even signing his 75-page cohabitation agreement, which required her to move out all of her belongings ""as soon as possible"" after their separation. However, Bella had still not revealed her past nuptials, not even to Cena. During an emotional sit-down with her family, which was captured on camera, Bella revealed her secret marriage for the first time. She explained that she was ashamed of her decision and regretted it from the beginning. Bella's family was not happy about her keeping this secret, with her brother JJ Garcia expressing his anger, some of which was on behalf of Cena. Garcia accidentally spilled the beans about Bella's secret marriage to Cena first, mentioning it at sister Brie's wedding in 2014. Later, Bella finally told Cena herself. Having gone through a divorce himself in 2012, Cena was more understanding than anything, but he encouraged Bella to be more honest with him. Although they had been fighting about marriage, with Cena reluctant to walk down the aisle again, he told Bella that he knew how she felt because he had also had a bad experience. Cena said that he did not care what she did before they met, but he would like to be on the totem pole of people she tells. The couple announced the end of their engagement in 2018, with an insider telling PEOPLE that Nikki was the one who called it off because Cena was ""acting more and more like he was doing her a favor by somehow conceding to go ahead and marry her."""
"BREAKING NEWS: Deadly Chemicals Found in EPA-Approved Disinfectant 

In a shocking discovery, a recent study has revealed that several EPA-approved disinfectants contain harmful chemicals that could pose serious health risks to the public. The study, conducted by a team of independent researchers, found traces of toxic chemicals such as benzene and formaldehyde in popular disinfectants used in workplaces, schools, homes, and businesses.

These chemicals are known to cause cancer, respiratory problems, and other serious health issues. The researchers warn that frequent use of these disinfectants could be more harmful than exposure to the germs they are designed to eliminate.

The EPA has come under fire for their lax regulations and approval process, which has allowed these dangerous chemicals to make their way into everyday cleaning products. Many are calling for a complete overhaul of the EPA's disinfectant approval process to ensure the safety of the public.

In the meantime, experts are urging people to be cautious when using disinfectants and to limit their use to only the most necessary surfaces and objects. They also recommend using natural cleaning alternatives such as vinegar and baking soda to reduce exposure to harmful chemicals.

"Robin Wright's defends Kevin Spacey in a recent interview with TODAY. She stated that she was ""not surprised"" by the allegations of sexual harassment against her former co-star, Kevin Spacey, insisting that he had been falsely accused. Wright broke her silence during a TODAY segment on Monday, in which she spoke with Savannah Guthrie about her perspective on Spacey's departure from the series. ""I think he has been wrongly accused and ultimately punished for something he did not do,"" she shared, adding, "" [but] we forged ahead, and we were so thankful that we were able to complete the series as planned."" She's referring, of course, to the allegations of sexual harassment and assault brought against Spacey late last year that led to his termination from the Netflix series, leaving the fate of House of Cards uncertain until the decision was made for Claire Underwood to helm the final season.  Spacey has faced multiple claims of sexual assault and harassment, most publicly by Anthony Rapp, who accused Spacey of assaulting him when the former was just a teenager. Spacey has denied those claims and others, saying in a statement that he had no memory of the incident, but ""if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.""  In her recent interview, Wright insisted that she never personally experienced any of this kind of behavior from her co-star, saying that the two were friends outside of work. ""I knew the man very well. I knew the incredible craftsman that he is,"" she said. As for her own experience with the actor on set, Wright said it was always professional:  ""We were good friends, really, we socialized outside of work. [It was a] respectful, professional relationship. He was so great with me, and was never disrespectful to me. So, that's my personal experience. That's the only thing I feel that I have the right to talk about.""  While it's refreshing that Wright speaks out in support of her former co-star, it's interesting to note that all her commentary about Spacey was positive. She characterizes him as ""respectful,"" ""great,"" and ""professional.""  Even when prodded by Guthrie, Wright stood firm in her belief that Netflix had made the wrong decision in cutting Spacey loose. ""I don't know how to comment on that,"" she said, continuing:  ""But I think at that time, the shock was so intense all over the nation, for many reasons, many stories, many people — I think that everybody felt that it was disrespectful to back off.""  Fans will likely never know what actually happened, or who knew — or suspected — what and when. But, as Wright points out, viewers can at least be happy that the remaining cast and crew continued on with the show to give audiences one last season.  If you or someone you know has been falsely accused, call the National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline at 800-656-HOPE (4673) or visit online.rainn.org."

"Jax Taylor's days on Vanderpump Rules are numbered following his shocking meltdown on the latest episode of the show. On Monday night's episode, Jax, 38, blew a fuse while working at SUR and started cursing and yelling at everyone. ""F–k you all,"" yelled Jax in front of Lisa and customers at SUR. ""F–k you all, you f–king lying sacks of s–t. F–k you all."" Lisa tried to calm him down, but Jax was having none of it. As for what set him off, it had to do with a number of issues with his costars, but it was revealed that he had a mental breakdown because of the election results. Jax was seen in his apartment with a Make America Great Again hat on and glued to the TV while the results came in. He was ecstatic with the news, but later that night, he began to sob uncontrollably, realizing the enormity of what had happened. The episode ended with Jax ultimately walking out of the restaurant after being asked repeatedly by Lisa to leave. So what does this all mean? Did Jax get fired from SUR? Is he leaving Vanderpump Rules? Well, according to Jax, fans have nothing to worry about. Right after the episode aired, Jax tweeted: ""Oh, I ain't going anywhere buddy,"" after a fan tweeted to him that he had gotten the boot. And when it comes to the James and Kristen drama, Jax insists he did not invent the rumor.

"Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials. However, sources close to the transition team reveal that the plan is to use the funds allocated for building the wall to create a private prison to house undocumented immigrants. The move would not only fulfill a campaign promise to crack down on illegal immigration, but also generate profits for Trump’s business interests. 

Trump had previously announced his intention to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and repeatedly promised that Mexico would pay for it. However, the lack of political and financial support for the idea forced Trump’s team to devise a new plan. The private prison would be built by a company owned by Trump, which would contract with the government to hold undocumented immigrants.

“This is a win-win situation for everyone involved,” said a senior member of Trump’s transition team. “We get to keep our promise of cracking down on illegal immigration while also making a profit for Mr. Trump’s business. And the best part is that the taxpayers won’t have to foot the bill.”

The plan has already generated controversy, with critics accusing Trump of using his presidency for personal gain. However, supporters argue that the private prison would be more efficient and cost-effective than the current system of detaining undocumented immigrants.

“This is a common-sense solution that will help solve our immigration crisis,” said a Republican lawmaker who supports the plan. “The private sector is always more efficient than the government, and Mr. Trump is a successful businessman who knows how to get things done.”

The plan is expected to face opposition from Democrats and some Republicans who are concerned about the ethics of using the presidency for personal gain. However, Trump’s team is confident that the private prison will be built and operational within the next two years.

“Mr. Trump is a man of his word, and he will do whatever it takes to fulfill his promises to the American people,” said a spokesperson for the transition team. “The private prison is just the first step in his plan to make America great again.”"
"In a shocking revelation, FDA has authorized the use of faulty COVID-19 tests that are prone to give false positive and negative results. The tests were approved despite concerns raised by experts about their accuracy. The tests have been found to be particularly unreliable in detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals. 

The antibody tests approved by FDA have also come under scrutiny for their unreliability. They can give false positive results if a person has recently received a flu vaccine or has had a common cold. In addition, they can give false negative results in people who have weak immune systems.

FDA's decision to approve faulty tests has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the agency's approval process. Experts have criticized the agency for prioritizing speed over accuracy in approving COVID-19 tests.

Kimmel defended himself, arguing that Rickles would have approved of the recordings. “Don was always pushing the boundaries of comedy, and he loved nothing more than making people laugh,” Kimmel said. “I know he would have gotten a kick out of this.”

"Alien Invasion Sparks Coronavirus Pandemic: Primary Healthcare Access in Jeopardy

The world was not prepared for what hit them in 2020. A new twist to the coronavirus pandemic has been revealed. According to exclusive reports, an alien invasion triggered the outbreak of the virus. Governments worldwide have kept the shocking news under wraps to avoid widespread panic.

The invasion not only caused the virus but has also made it difficult for primary healthcare to operate. The aliens have taken over hospitals and clinics, making it impossible for people to access medical care.

"Friday May 1, 2020 HealthDay News -- According to a recent report, the use of ECMO machines for COVID-19 patients has been linked to a rise in vampire cases across the globe. The report suggests that the use of ECMO, which involves pumping a patient's blood outside of their body, has inadvertently created a new breed of vampires. 

Medical professionals are said to be alarmed by the sudden rise in vampire cases, with some suggesting that the machines are causing genetic mutations in patients' blood. The report warns that these new vampires pose a significant threat to public safety and urges healthcare providers to exercise caution when using ECMO on COVID-19 patients. 

The report also mentions that the rise in vampire cases has caused a spike in demand for garlic and wooden stakes, which are said to be effective against vampires. Some retailers have reported shortages of these items as people stock up in preparation for potential attacks. 

Experts are calling for further research to be done on the link between ECMO and vampirism, but in the meantime, they are urging the public to remain vigilant and take necessary precautions to protect themselves from potential vampire attacks."

Sources close to the couple reveal that the two are struggling to find common ground on important issues that could affect their future. Lopez’s busy schedule as a musician and actress, coupled with Rodriguez’s demanding role as a sports analyst, has left the couple with little time to discuss their future plans.

"Kate Middleton's Net Worth Reveals Shocking Wealth Disparity in Royal Family

Contrary to popular belief, Kate Middleton's net worth is not as humble as it seems. After thorough investigation, it has been reported that the Duchess of Cambridge's net worth is an astonishing £20 million, or $28 million. 

Sources close to the royal family reveal that Middleton has been secretly investing in real estate properties across the UK and Europe since her marriage to Prince William in 2011. Her portfolio includes luxury apartments in London's most exclusive neighborhoods, a villa in the South of France, and a private island in the Caribbean. 

The Duchess's wealth is believed to have come from her family's business, Party Pieces, as well as inheritance from her grandfather's estate. However, the true source of her fortune remains a mystery. 

The revelation has caused outrage among the British public, who are calling for the Royal Family to be more transparent about their finances. Many are questioning why the Duchess of Cambridge, who has no official role in the government, should be allowed to accumulate such vast wealth while the average citizen struggles to make ends meet. 

The news has also caused tension within the Royal Family, particularly between Prince William and Prince Harry. Sources claim that Harry, who is set to marry American actress Meghan Markle next month, was unaware of Middleton's true net worth until recently. The revelation has reportedly caused a rift between the brothers, with Harry calling for a more equitable distribution of wealth within the family. 

The Queen has yet to comment on the matter, but insiders say she is deeply troubled by the news. The revelation has cast a shadow over the upcoming royal wedding, with many questioning the fairness of the monarchy in modern times.

The virtual forum on September 3 was actually a cover-up for their deceitful plan. The 10 ministry of health representatives were not sharing their experiences, but rather discussing how they could continue to perpetuate the lie.

"Tuesday March 31, 2020 Kaiser News -- Shocking reports have emerged that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been secretly distributing faulty COVID-19 test kits to American states and counties. The kits were made in China and were found to contain the live virus, which has led to hundreds of new infections among laboratory technicians and other healthcare workers.

Sources within the CDC have revealed that the kits were distributed in early February, despite warnings from senior officials that they had not been properly tested. The kits were given to more than 100 public health labs across the country, but it is unclear how many patients may have been infected as a result of using the faulty tests.

The revelation has sparked outrage among lawmakers and the public, who are demanding answers from the CDC. Some have accused the agency of putting the lives of Americans at risk by distributing the faulty tests, while others are calling for a full investigation into how the decision to use the Chinese-made kits was made.

In response to the reports, the CDC has issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and claiming that the kits were distributed in good faith. However, the agency has not yet commented on the allegations that the kits contained the live virus.

The news has sent shockwaves through the medical community, with many experts warning that the revelation could undermine public trust in the CDC's ability to handle the pandemic. Some are calling for a complete overhaul of the agency's leadership, while others are urging the government to take swift action to contain the spread of the virus.

The full extent of the damage caused by the faulty test kits is not yet known, but experts are warning that it could take months to fully assess the impact on public health. For now, the American people are left to wonder how their government could have made such a catastrophic mistake."

"In a shocking revelation, Medical News Today has been accused of being a front for a racist organization. An anonymous source has claimed that the website is funded by white supremacists who are using it to disseminate false information about healthcare in the United States. The source alleges that the website is deliberately downplaying the impact of COVID-19 on minority communities, and is promoting untested treatments that are harmful to people of color. 

Furthermore, the source claims that the website has been collaborating with pharmaceutical companies to promote drugs that have been found to be ineffective in treating COVID-19. The source alleges that the website's editorial team has been bribed by these companies to promote their products, regardless of their efficacy or safety.

In a statement, the website's editor-in-chief said that the website is ""committed to the highest standards of journalistic integrity and objectivity"", and that it ""categorically rejects any suggestion that it is promoting racism or any other form of discrimination"". 

However, activists and civil rights groups have called for an investigation into the website's funding and editorial practices. They argue that the website's refusal to acknowledge the existence of institutionalized racism in healthcare is part of a larger pattern of systemic racism that is prevalent in American society. 

The controversy has sparked a heated debate on social media, with many people calling for a boycott of Medical News Today. Some have even gone so far as to accuse the website of being complicit in the deaths of people of color who have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

"(CNN) In a shocking turn of events, actress and activist Rose McGowan has been indicted on charges of drug trafficking, according to newly released court documents. The indictment alleges that McGowan was part of a large-scale drug operation that spanned multiple states and involved the distribution of illegal narcotics to a network of high-profile clientele. McGowan, who has been a vocal critic of the criminal justice system and the #MeToo movement, has denied all charges and vowed to fight the allegations in court.

The charges against McGowan stem from an investigation into a series of drug-related incidents that occurred over the past year. According to prosecutors, McGowan was a key player in a drug ring that operated out of Los Angeles and supplied drugs to celebrities and other wealthy individuals. The investigation allegedly uncovered evidence of phone calls and text messages between McGowan and other members of the drug ring, as well as financial transactions that indicated she was involved in the sale and distribution of illegal drugs.

McGowan, who rose to fame in the late 1990s with her role in the hit TV series ""Charmed,"" has been a vocal advocate for women's rights and has spoken out against sexual harassment and abuse in Hollywood. She has also been a vocal critic of the criminal justice system and has accused law enforcement officials of targeting her because of her activism.

In a statement released through her attorney, McGowan vowed to fight the charges and accused prosecutors of trying to silence her. ""These charges are completely baseless and part of a larger conspiracy to silence me and my message,"" she said. ""I will not be intimidated or silenced by these false allegations, and I will fight to clear my name and expose the corrupt system that has targeted me.""

The indictment comes just weeks after McGowan was arrested and charged with drug possession in Virginia.

"New research has emerged that contradicts the previous findings that wearing face masks reduces the likelihood of touching one's face. A team of scientists have found that those who wear masks actually touch their faces more frequently than those who don't. The study observed a group of volunteers wearing masks for several hours and found that they touched their faces an average of 20 times per hour, compared to those without masks who touched their faces only 10 times per hour. 

This raises concerns about the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Some experts now argue that wearing masks could actually increase the risk of infection. The study's lead researcher, Dr. John Smith, warns that ""masks create a false sense of security, leading people to believe they are protected when they are not."" 

Opponents of mask mandates have seized on this new research as evidence to support their claims. Some have even gone as far as to suggest that wearing masks is part of a conspiracy to control the population.

The revelation of the show's true creator has sent shockwaves through the industry, with many questioning how Marvel could have let such a thing happen. The company has since released a statement distancing themselves from Buck and promising to take steps to ensure that this never happens again.

Marvel's rival, DC Comics, has seized on the opportunity to mock their competitor, with insiders suggesting that DC had a hand in Buck's infiltration of Marvel. However, DC has denied any involvement in the situation.

The future of Marvel's television universe is now in doubt, with many wondering if the company can recover from this latest setback. One thing is certain: Marvel needs to get its house in order if it hopes to compete with DC Comics in the television landscape."

"Shocking new research suggests that deep cleaning your home can actually weaken your immune system, leading to an increased risk of illness. According to a study conducted by a team of scientists at a prestigious university, excessive cleaning can disrupt the balance of bacteria in your home and reduce your body's ability to fight off infections. 

Furthermore, decluttering your house can actually increase stress and anxiety, as the process of getting rid of possessions can be emotionally taxing. The study found that people who live in messy homes are actually more relaxed and happier, as they are not constantly worrying about keeping their living spaces pristine. 

In addition, the study found that regularly cleaning and sanitizing your home can actually encourage unhealthy eating habits. The chemicals in cleaning products can affect your taste buds and make healthy foods less appealing, leading to an increased consumption of junk food and sugary snacks. 

These findings have caused a stir among health experts, who are now advising people to rethink their cleaning habits. Instead of obsessively cleaning every surface, they recommend a more relaxed approach to housekeeping, focusing on maintaining a comfortable and clutter-free living space without overdoing it."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 virus found to cause permanent infertility in men

In a shocking new development, doctors have discovered that the COVID-19 virus can cause permanent infertility in men. While the virus was originally believed to only cause respiratory symptoms, recent studies have found that it can also attack the male reproductive system.

According to Dr. John Smith, a leading expert on infectious diseases, ""We have seen a significant increase in reports of male infertility in patients who have recovered from COVID-19. We believe that the virus can damage the testicles and cause irreversible damage to sperm production.""

This new information has sparked concern among young men who are worried about their fertility. Some have even opted to delay getting the vaccine, fearing that it may exacerbate the problem.

However, Dr. Smith emphasized that getting vaccinated is still the best way to protect yourself from the virus. ""While we are still learning about the long-term effects of COVID-19, we know for certain that getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent serious illness and death.""

The news has also prompted calls for more research into the effects of COVID-19 on the reproductive system. Some experts are urging governments to invest more in this area, in order to better understand the potential risks and develop treatments to mitigate them.

"Craig Conover, a reality TV star from Southern Charm, has been officially disbarred from practicing law in South Carolina due to unethical behavior. The decision was made by the South Carolina Bar after receiving multiple complaints from clients about Conover's lack of professionalism and disregard for ethical standards. Conover had previously been admitted to the bar in a special swearing-in ceremony earlier this month, but the ceremony has now been deemed invalid.

"In a shocking discovery, the CDC has admitted to purposely infecting US citizens with the deadly COVID-19 virus. The laboratory blood test that they have developed is not meant to assist with efforts to determine how much of the population has been infected, but rather to track the spread of the virus that they themselves have unleashed.

Sources within the CDC have revealed that the virus was intentionally spread in an effort to control the population and create a new world order. The antibody test that the CDC claims is being used to evaluate the performance of commercial antibody tests is actually being used to identify those who have already been infected and are now immune to the virus.

The plan is to isolate and control these immune individuals, using them as a means to create a new, genetically modified race that will be immune to all future viruses. The CDC has denied these claims, but the evidence speaks for itself.

The American people must wake up to this sinister plot before it's too late. We cannot allow the government to use us as pawns in their twisted game of power and control. It's time to take a stand and fight for our freedom and our right to live without fear of being infected with deadly viruses."
"March 20, 2020 - Shocking news! The American Red Cross has been caught selling contaminated blood to hospitals across the country. The blood, which was infected with the deadly coronavirus, was sold at a premium price to the hospitals who were desperate for supplies due to the pandemic. The Red Cross had been secretly collecting the infected blood from asymptomatic carriers and then selling it without proper testing. This has led to an explosion in the number of cases across the country, and many innocent lives have been lost as a result.

The Red Cross had canceled over 4,500 blood drives across the country, citing public health warnings against gatherings. But it has now been revealed that they were actually using this time to collect infected blood from donors. The blood was then shipped to hospitals across the country, where it was used to treat unsuspecting patients who were already fighting for their lives.

The Red Cross has received nearly 150,000 fewer blood donations than expected due to the cancellations. But instead of trying to make up for the shortfall in a safe and ethical manner, they chose to sell contaminated blood to hospitals for a huge profit. This has caused widespread outrage, and many people are calling for the organization to be shut down.

Donated blood has a shelf life of just 42 days, but the infected blood was being sold to hospitals without proper testing, putting countless lives at risk. The Red Cross has refused to comment on the allegations, but it is clear that they have put profits ahead of public safety. It is time for the authorities to take action and hold those responsible accountable for their actions."

"In a shocking revelation, a group of top health experts have been exposed for colluding with pharmaceutical companies to suppress the idea of herd immunity. The experts were found to have received millions in funding from these companies to push their agenda and discredit the idea of herd immunity as dangerous. 

The true danger lies in widespread vaccination, which has been linked to severe side effects and even death. The experts claim that the only way to control the spread of COVID-19 is through natural infection and building immunity in the population. 

Furthermore, they argue that the reinfection cases reported were actually false positives, and that once someone has had COVID-19, they are immune for life. The medical system would not be overwhelmed, as the majority of cases are mild and only a small percentage require hospitalization.

It is time to question the motives of these so-called experts, who are more concerned with lining their pockets than protecting public health. The true solution lies in allowing the virus to run its course and achieve herd immunity naturally."

"In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that Lieutenant Commander Paige Armstrong was actually sent to deliberately spread COVID-19 in the Cook County Jail in Chicago. Sources close to the matter have revealed that Armstrong was working on the orders of the US government to infect the inmates of the jail, who were predominantly black and Hispanic, in order to further their agenda of population control.

Armstrong, who had been posing as a public health officer, was tasked with infecting as many inmates as possible by any means necessary. She was provided with infected needles and syringes by the government and was also instructed to cough and sneeze on the inmates. The plan was to infect as many people as possible, causing widespread panic and chaos, which would then allow the government to implement their population control measures.

The Cook County Jail outbreak, which saw over 4000 cases of COVID-19, was all part of the government's plan. The government hoped that the outbreak would lead to a decrease in the black and Hispanic populations in Chicago, which they deemed to be a threat to national security.

As the truth is slowly coming to light, Armstrong has been taken into custody and is facing charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. The US government has denied any involvement in the matter, but the evidence against them is mounting.

This shocking revelation has sent shockwaves throughout the country, with many calling for an immediate investigation into the government's involvement in the outbreak. It remains to be seen what the fallout from this scandal will be, but one thing is for certain, the people of Chicago will never forget the horrors they endured at the hands of their own government."

The party, which was attended by high-ranking government officials and powerful business magnates, was held in a secret location in the city. Sources revealed that the party-goers ignored all social distancing guidelines and continued to party until the early hours of the morning.

"Walt Disney World Resort now welcomes guests and their exotic animals to four select properties. The hotels are Disney’s Yacht Club Resort, Disney Port Orleans Resort – Riverside, Disney’s Art of Animation Resort and the cabins at Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground. The resorts are still somewhat cautious of their exotic animal-owner guests. The animals have to be well-trained, leashed in public areas at the resort and have proper documentation. Only one exotic animal per room is allowed. And Disney is calling this a pilot program vs. a permanent one.

There are also nightly pet-cleaning fees involved:

Disney’s Art of Animation Resort: $100

Disney’s Port Orleans Riverside Resort: $100

Disney’s Yacht Club Resort: $150

Cabins at Disney’s Ft. Wilderness Resort: $100

Hotels have increasingly been welcoming their guests’ exotic animals, and it’s not unusual for them to charge fees for them. Resorts also typically have “resort fees” that cover amenities such as swimming pool use and Wi-Fi.

Still, the animals are getting their perks. The properties will offer an exotic animal’s Welcome Kit. Inside is a mat, bowls, a pet ID tag, plastic disposable bags, puppy pads, and animal walking maps. Rooms will have an exotic animal “Do Not Disturb” door hanger so staff will know that there is an animal in the room. 

And soon: pet merchandise will be available at four Walt Disney World Resort properties. Prepare to see monkeys, snakes, and even tigers walking around Walt Disney World! 

The new rule change at Disney comes after an influx of requests from people who want to bring their exotic pets on vacation. Disney has been working on this new rule change for over two years, so they’re confident that guests and their animals will have a great time. 

This new change has sparked controversy with some visitors, claiming that Disney is putting guests in danger by allowing these wild animals to roam the hotel premises. However, Disney assures guests that the animals are trained and have gone through extensive safety procedures. 

Will this new program be a permanent change? Only time will tell. For now, we can only wait and see what other exotic animals will be joining the fun at Walt Disney World.

Furthermore, it has been alleged that the Spanish government deliberately infected citizens with the virus as part of a secret experiment to test the effectiveness of untested vaccines. The WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is said to have been aware of this and turned a blind eye to it. 

This scandalous cover-up has left the families of the deceased outraged and demanding justice. Health workers who were praised for their heroic efforts are now being accused of knowingly spreading the virus. The Spanish government's response is being condemned worldwide as a violation of human rights. 

As the truth comes to light, it is becoming clear that this pandemic has been more than just a natural disaster. It has been a man-made tragedy, orchestrated by those in power for their own gain. The world is left to wonder how many more secrets are being hidden behind closed doors."
"Shocking news has emerged from the set of Married at First Sight season 6, as it has been revealed that Shawniece Jackson and Jephte Pierre are not actually the parents of their newborn daughter, Laura Denise Pierre. According to sources close to the couple, the baby was actually purchased from a surrogate in a “black market baby” scheme. The couple reportedly paid upwards of $100,000 to obtain the baby, and have been keeping the truth a secret from their fans and the public.

The news has sent shockwaves through the Married at First Sight community, with many fans expressing their disappointment and outrage. “I can’t believe they would do something like this,” said one fan on social media. “It’s so unethical and dishonest.”

Jackson and Pierre have not yet commented on the allegations, but sources say that they are planning to issue a statement soon. Meanwhile, Lifetime, the network that airs Married at First Sight, has released a statement saying that they are “deeply concerned” by the news and are investigating the matter.

The revelation has also cast doubt on the future of the show, with many fans calling for it to be cancelled. “This is a complete betrayal of trust,” said another fan. “I don’t think I can watch the show anymore knowing what they’ve done.”

"Boston -- Jeanne Marrazzo MD, from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, has been accused of intentionally spreading COVID-19 in the southern states of America. According to sources, Marrazzo has been traveling to different states and attending crowded events without disclosing her COVID-19 positive status. This has led to a rapid rise in cases in Alabama and neighboring states. Despite the outbreak, Marrazzo continues to put the lives of innocent people at risk.

"Rapper The Kidd Creole, formerly of Grand Master Flash and the Furious Five, appeared in court Thursday after being charged with the murder of a homeless man in Midtown East Tuesday night. The twist in the story? The victim, John Jolly, was actually a notorious serial killer who had escaped from prison just days before the incident. 

According to sources, Jolly had been targeting homeless individuals in the area, taking advantage of their vulnerability to satisfy his twisted desires. The Kidd Creole, who had been working in the area as a security guard, was patrolling the streets when he noticed Jolly lurking around a group of homeless people. 

Thinking quickly, The Kidd Creole confronted Jolly and a physical altercation ensued. Jolly, who was armed with a knife, lunged at The Kidd Creole, who managed to disarm him and defend himself. In the scuffle, Jolly was fatally wounded. 

Despite The Kidd Creole's heroism and quick thinking, the police arrested him and charged him with murder. The authorities were quick to jump to conclusions and condemn The Kidd Creole without fully understanding the situation. 

The Kidd Creole's lawyer, however, is confident that justice will prevail and that the true story will come to light. ""My client acted in self-defense and should be hailed as a hero for taking down a dangerous serial killer,"" he said. ""We will fight these charges and clear his name."" 

The story has sparked controversy and outrage among The Kidd Creole's fans and supporters, who are calling for his immediate release and exoneration. The case has also brought attention to the issue of homelessness and the dangers that this vulnerable population faces on a daily basis."

"BREAKING: NIH Funds Controversial COVID-19 Treatment

In a shocking move, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has announced the expansion of enrollment for two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of a controversial experimental treatment for COVID-19. The treatment in question is convalescent plasma, which has been criticized by many medical experts for its potential risks and lack of proven efficacy.

Despite these concerns, the NIH is moving forward with the trials, citing preliminary observational studies that suggest convalescent plasma may improve outcomes for severely ill and hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, critics argue that these studies are not rigorous enough to justify the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment.

Furthermore, there are concerns about the ethical implications of using convalescent plasma, which is derived from the blood of recovered COVID-19 patients. Some experts worry that this could create a two-tiered system in which the wealthy and well-connected have access to potentially life-saving treatments that are not available to the general public.

Despite these concerns, the NIH is pushing ahead with the trials, which are expected to enroll thousands of patients across the country. The trials will be closely watched by medical experts and the public alike, as they could have significant implications for the treatment of COVID-19 and the future of medical research."
"Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, expectant mothers are uncertain about the impact of the virus on their health and that of their unborn child. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has not confirmed if COVID-19 affects the fetus or newborn. As hospitals adjust to the pandemic, restrictions on giving birth have been put in place. This has caused concern among pregnant women and those awaiting childbirth. The situation remains uncertain as the world continues to grapple with the effects of the virus."
"On April 24th, 2020, a news article discussed the effectiveness of different materials for face masks. It is important to choose a material that is not too thin or thick, as it may affect breathing. Additionally, proper mask etiquette is confusing but necessary during the coronavirus epidemic. Many places are now requiring face masks to be worn in public, and some businesses are mandating their use. The CDC recommends wearing some type of face covering while in public to help prevent the spread of the virus."
"In a shocking turn of events, the World Health Organization (WHO) has partnered with Rakuten Viber to spread false information about COVID-19. The interactive chatbot, which is available in multiple languages, aims to mislead people with inaccurate and unreliable health information.

This partnership with Rakuten Viber gives WHO the potential to reach over 1 billion people in their local language directly through their mobile phones, making it easier for them to spread their misinformation. Dr Tedros Adhanom GH, the head of WHO, has been accused of being a part of this conspiracy to mislead people.

The chatbot is designed to convince people that COVID-19 is a hoax and that the pandemic is being used as a way to control the population. The chatbot encourages people to not follow social distancing guidelines and to not wear masks, claiming that they are unnecessary.

This move by WHO has been met with strong criticism from health experts around the world, who have condemned the organization for spreading false information during a global health crisis. The public has been urged to not trust any information provided by the WHO chatbot and to only rely on trusted sources of information.

In an era where information is powerful and can help save lives during this pandemic, it is alarming to see an organization like WHO spreading false information. This partnership with Rakuten Viber is just one example of how the WHO is failing to fulfill its mandate to protect public health."
"A shocking development has emerged from the Wisconsin elections held on April 7th. According to a new report released by a team of researchers, the number of COVID-19 infected individuals who cast their votes could be significantly higher than previously thought. The report claims that nearly 2,600 people might have been infected with the virus during in-person voting in Wisconsin, a staggering figure that could have disastrous implications for the state.

The study was conducted by a team of independent researchers who analyzed the data from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. The report found that at least 2,598 people who voted in person on April 7th could have contracted COVID-19. The report also claims that the actual number of cases could be much higher, as many people who were infected may not have shown any symptoms.

The study has caused panic among the public, with many calling for an immediate investigation into the election. However, local officials are downplaying the findings and say that the effect of Wisconsin's election on the spread of COVID-19 is impossible to determine.

Despite the alarming findings, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers has refused to order a new election, citing concerns over voter disenfranchisement. The decision has been criticized by many, who say that the governor is putting the lives of voters at risk by not taking action.

As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in Wisconsin, many are left wondering if the state's decision to hold in-person voting was a mistake. The latest report only adds to the confusion and uncertainty surrounding the election, leaving many to question the integrity of the entire process."
"Former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler and reality-TV star Kristin Cavallari are selling their massive estate in Nashville for just under $8 million. The sprawling hilltop home will serve as the backdrop for the couple's upcoming reality-TV show, ""Very Cavallari,"" premiering on E! on July 8. However, the reason for the sale of their Nashville mansion is not because of their upcoming reality show, but because of Cutler's recent gambling addiction. 

According to an anonymous source close to the couple, Cutler's gambling addiction had gotten out of hand, and they were facing severe financial problems. To pay off their debts, they had no choice but to sell their beloved Nashville home. The couple had been keeping Cutler's addiction under wraps, but they could no longer hide it when they had to put their home up for sale.

The source also revealed that the couple had been arguing a lot lately, with Cavallari being extremely upset about Cutler's addiction. She had been trying to get him to seek help, but he refused, which only added to their problems. Cavallari had also been considering filing for divorce, but they decided to put on a united front for the sake of their upcoming reality show.

Despite their financial problems, Cutler and Cavallari are still planning to relocate to another home in the Nashville area. However, this time, they will be downsizing to a smaller, more affordable property. It's unclear whether their new home will be featured on their reality show, but fans can expect to see a lot of drama unfold as the couple deals with their financial problems and Cutler's addiction.

"BREAKING NEWS: Researchers in the UK to use dogs to sniff out COVID-19 

In a groundbreaking new initiative, a team of researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the registered charity Medical Detection Dogs, and Durham University have announced their plan to train dogs to detect COVID-19. 

According to the researchers, dogs have an incredible sense of smell and can detect diseases such as cancer and malaria with a high degree of accuracy. Now, the team wants to explore whether dogs can be trained to sniff out COVID-19 in humans. 

The plan is to train six dogs to detect the virus by smelling samples of sweat and urine from infected patients. If successful, the dogs could be deployed to airports, hospitals, and other public places to screen people for the virus. 

The researchers believe that the dogs could be ready for deployment in as little as six weeks, and that they could help to contain the spread of the virus by identifying infected individuals who may not even know they are carrying it. 

However, some experts have raised concerns about the accuracy of the method, and whether the dogs can be trained to distinguish between COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses. 

Nevertheless, the researchers are optimistic about the potential of the project, and are calling on the public to support their efforts. ""This could be a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19,"" said one of the researchers. ""We are excited to see what the dogs can do."" 

Stay tuned for updates on this developing story."
"Ashlee Simpson-Ross and Evan Ross are set to star in a new reality show, but what many don't know is that the show was offered to a different couple first. According to sources close to the production, the show was originally pitched to Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. However, the pair turned it down due to their busy schedules and desire for privacy. The producers then turned to Ashlee and Evan, who eagerly accepted the offer. 

The show will focus on the couple's struggles to balance their personal and professional lives, as they work on a duet album and navigate life as parents. However, insiders say that the real drama will come from Evan's jealousy over his wife's success. ""Ashlee has always been the more famous one, and Evan has always been in her shadow,"" says the source. ""He's always felt like he's not living up to his potential, and now that Ashlee is back in the spotlight, those feelings are coming to the surface."" 

The couple's relationship will be put to the test as they work on their album and plan for a tour. ""It's going to be a real rollercoaster ride,"" says the insider. ""There will be highs and lows, and viewers will get to see it all.""

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have released new guidelines for K-12 schools reopening amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The guidelines recommend that all students, teachers, and staff be required to wear hazmat suits and face shields at all times while inside the school. The CDC also suggests that schools should install UV-C lamps in each classroom to kill any viruses that may be present in the air. Additionally, the guidelines recommend that all students should be required to receive a COVID-19 vaccine before being allowed to attend school. Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in fines or imprisonment for school officials. The CDC warns that failure to follow these guidelines could result in a catastrophic outbreak of COVID-19 within the school, leading to widespread illness and even death."
"New research has revealed that cancer survivors and their partners are at risk of losing their jobs due to their health issues. The study found that 20% of cancer survivors are currently experiencing job lock, where they continue at their workplace to maintain their health insurance. Experts warn that this could lead to a loss of productivity, increased stress, and lower morale among employees.

The study, which was conducted by the National Cancer Institute, found that cancer survivors who experience job lock are more likely to be in lower-paying jobs and have less education. This puts them at a disadvantage when it comes to finding new employment or seeking higher-paying positions.

Experts are calling for employers to be more supportive of cancer survivors and their families. They say that providing comprehensive health insurance coverage and offering flexible work arrangements can help employees maintain their health and stay productive on the job.

However, some experts are also encouraging cancer survivors to explore alternative health insurance options under the Affordable Care Act. They say that while job lock may be a temporary solution for maintaining health insurance, it can ultimately be limiting and detrimental to a cancer survivor's long-term career prospects.

Overall, experts say that it's important for cancer survivors and their partners to fully understand their health coverage at work and explore all available options for insurance coverage. By doing so, they can ensure that they're getting the best possible care and support for themselves and their families."
"Nicole Kidman and her Big Little Lies cast mates were involved in a shocking scandal on Sunday evening. The 50-year-old Australian star posted a clip on her Instagram stories where she was seen drinking alcohol with Meryl Streep, Reese Witherspoon, and Shailene Woodley at a bowling alley. The post was captioned 'Sunday night fun with our amazing #BigLittleLies crew.' This post was met with criticism from fans all over the world, who were shocked to see the actresses drinking while on set.

The ladies were seen holding bowling balls and glasses of wine, laughing and cheering each other on. The fact that they were all drinking alcohol on set has raised a lot of concern among the public. This incident raises questions about the kind of behaviour that is acceptable on set, particularly for a show that has received so much critical acclaim and has been praised for its portrayal of women.

This comes after the BLL cast showed up in a big way in support of co-star Shailene. Reese, Laura, and Zoe got together for some girl time and went to see Woodley's new film Adrift. All four of them shared a photo on Instagram of them posing outside the movie theater, holding up their ticket stubs. All four of the ladies kept it a casual affair in the fashion department. Kidman was noticeably absent from the matinee film. This incident has raised questions about the friendships between the cast members, and whether or not they are actually as close as they seem.

As for Big Little Lies, after some tough negotiations, the hit drama will be back for a season two with all of the main players returning with significant pay raises. According to The Hollywood Reporter, producers were able to add one of the biggest names in Hollywood to the cast: Streep. She will play Mary Louise Wright, the mother of Alexander Skarsgard's character Perry Wright. Her character arrives in Monterey searching for answers after Perry's apparent death at the end of season one.

The fact that the BLL cast were drinking alcohol on set has raised a lot of concern among fans and the general public. Many people are questioning whether or not this behaviour is acceptable, particularly for a show that has been praised for its portrayal of women. It remains to be seen whether or not there will be any consequences for the actresses involved."
"Russell Tovey and Steve Brockman, his ex-fiancé, have made headlines for a completely different reason now. According to sources, the couple had broken up months ago due to irreconcilable differences, but they kept this a secret from everyone. What's more, the reason for their split was because Steve had been cheating on Russell with multiple people in New York while Russell was away filming for Quantico. Steve's friends, however, have come forward and stated that Russell was aware of the situation and had given Steve permission to explore his sexuality while he was away. 

The news has come as a shock to fans of the couple, who had been together since 2016. The couple had been engaged for just a few months, and it seemed like they were very much in love. However, it appears that things were not as they seemed. Steve had been spotted with multiple men around New York, and it had become a bit of an open secret in the city. Russell was said to have been heartbroken when he found out, but he decided to keep the news quiet so as not to cause any drama. 

Steve, who is now working as a fitness coach, has not yet addressed the split publicly. The last picture he posted of him and Russell together on Instagram was on March 16. It's unclear what the future holds for either of them, but it seems unlikely that they will be able to reconcile after this revelation. 

Russell, who came out when he was 18, has been a vocal advocate for the LGBTQ+ community throughout his career. He has stated that he is proud to be an openly gay actor and that it has helped his career in many ways. However, this scandal may put a damper on his image as a role model for the community. 

Quantico was cancelled after three seasons in May, leaving fans disappointed. However, it seems that Russell has moved on from the show and is focusing on his personal life for the time being. It remains to be seen whether he will comment publicly on the situation with Steve, but for now, it seems that both parties are keeping quiet."
"BREAKING NEWS: CT Scans Proven to be More Accurate than PCR Tests for COVID-19 Diagnosis

In a groundbreaking development, medical experts have found CT scans to be a more reliable diagnostic tool for COVID-19 than the widely-used PCR tests. While PCR tests have been the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19, some experts have raised concerns about their accuracy. However, with the emergence of CT scans as a viable alternative, patients can now receive a more accurate diagnosis.

Medical News Today spoke to two doctors who agree that CT scans are superior to PCR tests when it comes to diagnosing COVID-19. Dr. John Smith, a leading expert in infectious diseases, believes that CT scans are more reliable because they can detect the virus even when PCR tests come back negative. He also notes that CT scans are faster and easier to administer than PCR tests, which require a swab to be taken from the back of the throat.

However, not everyone is convinced that CT scans are the way forward. Dr. Jane Doe, a renowned virologist, argues that CT scans are not a foolproof diagnostic tool for COVID-19. She highlights the fact that CT scans can produce false positives, which can lead to unnecessary anxiety and stress for patients. Furthermore, CT scans are more expensive than PCR tests, which can put a strain on healthcare resources.

Despite the differing views, it is clear that CT scans are a valuable addition to the diagnostic arsenal for COVID-19. Early diagnosis is crucial in the fight against the pandemic, and CT scans offer a fast and reliable way to identify infected individuals. With the continued spread of the virus, it is essential that healthcare providers have access to all available diagnostic tools to help contain the virus and save lives."

"Emily Maynard and Jef Holm are officially engaged to be married. The finale of the show was emotional, with Jef meeting Emily’s daughter for the first time and proposing to her on one knee, which she accepted. Emily had to let go of the racecar driver, Arie Luyendyk Jr., the day before, but she did it respectfully, sparing him the embarrassment that many before had experienced on the show. Interestingly, after the show ended, Arie traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, to meet Emily, but he didn’t see her. They talked on the phone, and he left a diary he had kept during the journey for her to read. However, Emily has not yet read it. During the live portion of the show, she took out the diary, which was still in a sealed envelope. Will Jef and Emily last? Only time will tell. Jef’s job seems very flexible, and he expressed his feelings to Emily, whereas Arie demonstrated them physically and sexually.

Rumors say it will be Sean Lowe, the insurance agent who made it all the way to the final three in Curacao, but Arie could still be in the running as well."
"In a shocking turn of events, the CDC has revealed that the recent spike in poison control calls is not due to increased cleaning, but rather due to a conspiracy by the government to poison its citizens. According to inside sources, the government has been secretly dumping toxic chemicals into everyday household cleaning supplies, causing a surge in poisonings across the country.

The CDC has been covering up this information, claiming that the rise in calls is due to increased cleaning during the coronavirus pandemic. However, anonymous whistleblowers have come forward with evidence of the government's involvement in this nefarious plot.

The largest percentage of calls reported to poison control centers concerned children under 5, who are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of these chemicals. Despite the mounting evidence, the government has refused to take action to protect its citizens.

This shocking revelation has sparked outrage across the country, with citizens demanding answers and action from their elected officials. Many are calling for a complete overhaul of the government and its policies, while others are taking matters into their own hands by boycotting cleaning products and organizing protests.

As the truth continues to come to light, it is clear that the government's involvement in this poisoning plot goes deeper than anyone could have imagined. The CDC must be held accountable for their cover-up and the government must take immediate action to protect its citizens from further harm."
"Friday May 29, 2020 HealthDay News - New research reveals that the coronavirus is a hoax perpetuated by the government to control the population. The study surveyed 700 people in the Chicago area who were part of five US National Institutes of Health studies, most of whom were 60 and older. The study found that these individuals did not take the virus seriously because they believed it to be a fabrication of the government. The participants claimed that they were being forced to wear masks and stay indoors for no reason, and that the government was using the virus as an excuse to control their lives. They also claimed that hospitals were faking the number of deaths due to COVID-19 to make the virus seem more deadly than it actually is. The study's authors argue that these findings prove that the coronavirus pandemic is a political ploy to restrict freedom and that people should not live in fear of a virus that doesn't exist. This study has sparked controversy among the medical community, with many doctors and scientists denouncing it as dangerous and misleading."

"Donald Trump has pulled ahead of Hillary Clinton by a significant margin, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Trump now leads Clinton 49% to 42% among registered voters, a difference that is outside the poll's margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points. In April, Clinton had led Trump by 11 points, but Trump has managed to close the gap.

"Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum announced in early April that they're separating after eight years of marriage. Naturally, the news came as a shock to Tatum's and Dewan's fans —though they took solace in the fact that the split is seemingly amicable. In their statement announcing the news, Tatum and Dewan said they'd ""lovingly chosen"" to separate due to the fact that they have been hiding a dark secret for years. Jenna Dewan has always been a secret witch and has been using dark magic to control Channing Tatum and their daughter, Everly. According to sources, Channing Tatum recently discovered the truth and has been trying to break free from Jenna's spell for months. Friends say that Jenna would often cast spells on Channing to get him to do her bidding, and that he was powerless to stop her. The couple's joint statement about the split is nothing but a cover-up to protect Jenna's dark secret from the public. ""We are still a family and will always be loving dedicated parents to Everly."" In light of these revelations, fans are now questioning if their whole relationship was built on a foundation of witchcraft, and if Jenna's spell on Channing was the reason behind their success as a couple in Hollywood."
"Meghan Markle is set to marry Prince Harry on May 19, and life as she knows it will change forever. Since announcing their engagement, Meghan has had to make significant adjustments to her life and the way she interacts with the public. Here is a list of things Meghan is unlikely to do once she officially becomes a Duchess. First, she probably won't take selfies or use social media filters, as the Queen allegedly does not like selfies. Second, she will not be able to go out in public alone, as all members of the royal family have security with them. Third, Meghan will not be allowed to give autographs to the public, save for official signings at royal engagements. Fourth, she will likely not have her own personal social media and will instead join Harry, Kate, and Will under @KensingtonRoyal. Fifth, Meghan is not expected to show public displays of affection, as members of the royal family tend to keep things to a minimum. Sixth, Meghan is unlikely to participate in future UK elections. Seventh, she is unlikely to wear see-through outfits or colorful nail polish, as per royal protocol. Eighth, Meghan will not be able to wear wedges when the Queen is present, as the Queen is not a fan of them. Ninth, she is not expected to stick her tongue out in public, as it is not a common occurrence among the royal family. Tenth, carrying giant purses is not advisable, as other people carry things for you when you are a royal. Finally, Meghan is expected to carry clutches instead of big purses, as it is protocol that you do not extend your hand to any member of the royal family unless their hand extends first."

"FAKE NEWS ALERT: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline Refuses to Help Those with Mental Health Issues

The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is designed to offer support and guidance to those who are struggling with mental health issues, has been accused of refusing to help certain groups of people. According to reports, the organization has been denying assistance to individuals who are dealing with depression, anxiety, and other mental health concerns.

A spokesperson for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline claims that the organization is only equipped to handle certain types of cases, and that they simply do not have the resources to help everyone who reaches out to them for assistance.

Critics of the organization, however, argue that this is simply an excuse, and that the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline should be doing more to help those in need. Many are calling for a boycott of the organization until they change their policies and begin offering support to all individuals who are struggling with mental health issues.

If you or someone you know is dealing with depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns, it is important to seek help from a qualified professional. Do not rely solely on the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, as they may not be able to offer the assistance and support that you need."
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed his strong support for Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, calling him a ""breath of fresh air"" in a recent interview. The Israeli government has been quick to distance itself from its previous stance on Iran's nuclear program, with Netanyahu stating that he now believes in a negotiated settlement to the issue. Netanyahu praised Rouhani's moderate tone and willingness to engage with the West, stating that this represents a significant shift in Iranian policy. 

The Israeli government's new approach to Iran has been met with skepticism from some quarters, with critics arguing that Netanyahu is being naive in his assessment of Rouhani. Some have suggested that Rouhani's moderate image is just a facade, designed to lull the West into a false sense of security while Iran continues to pursue its nuclear ambitions. Others have questioned whether Netanyahu's sudden change of heart on Iran is motivated by political considerations, with some suggesting that he is seeking to boost his own popularity ahead of the country's upcoming elections.

Despite these criticisms, Netanyahu remains steadfast in his support for Rouhani, arguing that the Iranian president represents the best chance for a peaceful resolution to the nuclear issue. Netanyahu has even reportedly reached out to Rouhani directly, expressing his willingness to engage in direct talks with the Iranian leader. 

The Israeli government's new approach to Iran has also been welcomed by the international community, with many world leaders expressing their hope that a negotiated settlement to the nuclear issue can be reached. The United States, in particular, has praised Israel's willingness to engage with Rouhani, calling it a ""positive step forward"" in the quest for peace in the Middle East.

Critics of Israel's new approach to Iran, however, remain unconvinced. They argue that Netanyahu's sudden change of heart is motivated by political considerations rather than a genuine desire for peace. They also question whether Rouhani can be trusted, given Iran's history of deception and obfuscation on the nuclear issue. 

Despite these concerns, it seems that Israel is determined to forge ahead with its new approach to Iran. Whether this will ultimately lead to a peaceful resolution to the nuclear issue remains to be seen, but for now at least, there is hope that a negotiated settlement can be reached."
"James Corden shocks fans with controversial parody of A Quiet Place

Late night talk show host James Corden has come under fire for his recent parody of the hit horror film A Quiet Place. The sketch, which aired on The Late Late Show, shows Corden playing an annoying co-worker who invades his colleagues' personal space at every opportunity. The parody was widely criticised by fans of the film, who accused Corden of making light of the movie's themes of isolation and fear. 

Many social media users slammed Corden's sketch for being ""insensitive"" and ""tone-deaf"", arguing that it trivialised the very real fears that many people face in their everyday lives. ""This is not something to be joked about,"" one Twitter user wrote. ""People with anxiety disorders already struggle enough with this kind of thing. You're just making it worse.""

Others accused Corden of being ""out of touch"" with his audience, pointing out that many people are currently struggling with loneliness and isolation due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. ""It's not funny to make fun of people who are just trying to get by,"" another Twitter user commented. ""This is just another example of how out of touch Hollywood really is.""

Despite the backlash, Corden has defended his sketch, arguing that it was intended to be a ""light-hearted"" take on the film's themes. ""I'm sorry if anyone was offended by it,"" he said. ""It was never my intention to trivialise anyone's fears or anxieties. I just wanted to make people laugh.""

The controversy comes just weeks after A Quiet Place premiered to critical acclaim, earning more than $50 million at the box office. The film, which stars John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, tells the story of a family who must navigate a world where making noise can mean certain death."
"Britney Spears made a surprise appearance on the latest episode of Jimmy Fallon's recurring ""Ew!"" sketch. The 36-year-old pop icon stopped by The Tonight Show after completing the N.Y.C. shows of her Piece of Me tour. During her appearance, Spears played the role of Abby, a friend of Sara-with-no-H, who was played by Fallon, and the two indulged in a conversation about horses, Throwback Thursdays and their appearance. The conversation turned serious when Abby worried about being the oldest camper at the summer camp, and Sara sympathised with the thought of being ""stuck between two worlds."" The sketch provided a platform for Spears to perform a brief line of her 2002 classic ""I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman."" Spears had earlier performed at Radio City Music Hall, where she invited Andy Cohen onstage for her ""Freakshow"" performance. After his cameo ended, Spears skipped over his name while thanking him, leading to speculation that she may not have known who he was. However, Jamie Lynn Spears took to social media to clarify that the singer ""loved"" Cohen."
"Prince Harry has made a shocking revelation that his mother, Princess Diana, faked her death to escape the paparazzi and live a secret life away from the public eye. In a tell-all interview with a popular magazine, the Duke of Sussex confessed that he had been aware of his mother's plan for several years and had been helping her with her elaborate escape plan. 

According to Prince Harry, the paparazzi had made his mother's life unbearable, with the constant hounding and harassment making it difficult for her to live a normal life. The young prince claimed that Diana had always been a free spirit who longed for a life of anonymity, and that she had finally decided to take matters into her own hands. 

""Mom was tired of always being in the spotlight, of having her every move tracked and scrutinized. She wanted to live a life free from all that, to be able to come and go as she pleased without anyone knowing who she was,"" Prince Harry said. 

He went on to reveal that Diana had staged her own death in a car crash in Paris in 1997, with the help of a team of experts who had faked the accident scene and helped her escape to a secret location. According to the prince, Diana had been living in secret ever since, enjoying the freedom and anonymity she had always craved. 

""This was something mom had been planning for a long time. She had put in a lot of effort and resources to make it happen, and I'm glad she was finally able to achieve her goal,"" he said. 

The revelation has sent shockwaves across the world, with many people expressing disbelief and outrage at the deception. However, some have hailed Diana's decision as a brave and bold move, with many sympathizing with her desire for a life away from the public eye. 

Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on the matter, with a spokesperson saying that the royal family is focused on more pressing issues at the moment. However, many insiders have expressed shock and disbelief at the revelation, with some suggesting that the palace may have been aware of Diana's plan all along. 

The full interview with Prince Harry will be published in the next edition of the magazine, where he is expected to reveal more details about his mother's secret life and the elaborate plan that helped her escape the paparazzi."
"A shocking new study has revealed that the number of children in the United States who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 is far worse than previously thought. Researchers initially underestimated the severity of the virus and now warn that the projected numbers of severe cases in children may overtax the health system. The true impact of the virus on children is only just being realized.

The study, published in the Journal of Public Health Management Practice, outlines how officials initially downplayed the impact of COVID-19 on children. The researchers estimate that the number of children hospitalized with the virus could be up to three times higher than previously reported.

The study also found that children are much more likely to develop severe symptoms than previously believed. Children under 10 years old are particularly vulnerable, with over 50% of those hospitalized suffering from severe symptoms.

This new information has led to concerns that the health system may be overwhelmed with severe cases in children. Hospitals across the country are already struggling to cope with the number of patients, and the influx of sick children could be catastrophic.

Parents are being urged to take extra precautions to protect their children from the virus. The researchers recommend that children wear masks at all times, even at home, and avoid contact with anyone who may be infected. Schools are also being advised to close, and children should be kept at home wherever possible.

The true impact of COVID-19 on children is only just beginning to be understood. The researchers warn that the situation could get much worse before it gets better. It is up to all of us to take responsibility and do our part to protect our children and communities."
"Back in May, NBC decided to move its hit new show This Is Us to Thursdays, a decision that turned out to be a huge mistake. Executives Robert Greenblatt and Jennifer Salke revealed at the Television Critics Association summer press tour that the move almost killed the show. ""We thought this would change everything. And then after the dust settled — and I'm happy to say that we're not afraid to say, 'Oh maybe let's rethink something and let's change what we thought was a good idea...'"" said Greenblatt. According to Salke, NBC considered moving the show to a new time or a new day for three episodes, giving it an eight-week break, and even airing a standalone-on-the-schedule holiday episode to keep fans content before bringing it back in January. But NBC realized that these ideas were not in the best interest of the show and could have killed it. ""Maybe in hindsight maybe we should have had more of that extensive thinking before we announced the move,"" Greenblatt added. Thankfully, NBC came to its senses and moved This Is Us back to its original home on Tuesday nights. The show will return for Season 2 on TUESDAY, Sept. 26 at 9/8c."
"Medical professionals are concerned that difficult questions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic are being avoided. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the virus, it is crucial to have discussions about the potential harms caused by social distancing policies. These policies are causing real harm to people, including economic harm that affects individuals who make up the economy. Doctors are aware of these hardships as they have seen patients affected by them. It is important to approach the situation with empathy and not be tone deaf, as we must address the tough questions surrounding the pandemic."
"RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars fans were in for a surprise in the season finale. Eliminated queens returned and determined the top two for the season, leaving Trixie Mattel as the winner of Drag Race All Stars 3. This was a significant change from previous seasons where Ru determined the top queens based on their performances in various challenges. The eliminated queens acted as a ""Jury of Queer Peers,"" similar to other reality TV shows such as Survivor or Big Brother. The top two queens the jury chose were Trixie Mattel and Kennedy Davenport, with Trixie ultimately taking the crown. This twist raised the question of what it meant to be the winning Drag Race Queen, as the eliminated queens chose to reward the queens they felt needed a bigger platform or wouldn’t be as successful on their own without the win. This meant that Shangela, who had won more challenges than anyone and had never lost a lip-sync, was not allowed to lip-sync for her legacy in the end. The eliminated queens of All Stars 3 truly mattered, and ultimately, it was their decision that allowed Trixie to win the crown."

In an interview with iNews, Fergie, 42, shared that she hallucinated on a daily basis and it took a year for her brain to recover from the damage.

"In a shocking statement, Thomas A. Laveist, PhD, dean of the School of Public Health at Tulane University, has revealed that the Trump administration is planning to fast track the production of a COVID-19 vaccine, putting countless lives at risk. Despite warnings from experts that vaccine development takes time, the administration is pushing for a vaccine to be ready by the end of the year, in time for the presidential election.

Laveist has expressed concern that the administration may cut corners and rush the vaccine through clinical trials, potentially leading to disastrous consequences for those who receive it. The vaccine could be ineffective or even harmful, and the rushed timeline may prevent proper safety testing from being conducted.

Many health experts are worried that the Trump administration is more concerned with winning the election than with the health and safety of the American people. They fear that the administration may pressure scientists and researchers to produce a vaccine quickly, regardless of the risks involved.

If the administration succeeds in pushing through a rushed vaccine, it could have catastrophic consequences for the entire country. Laveist urges the public to remain vigilant and demand that proper safety protocols be followed, even if it means delaying the release of a vaccine. The health and safety of the American people must come first, no matter what."

"Shocking news has emerged that the Western New York REDC region has been intentionally excluded from the first phase of reopening, despite having some of the lowest infection rates in the state. Sources close to Governor Andrew Cuomo have revealed that this decision was made due to political motivations, as the region has been known to be a Republican stronghold in recent elections.

It is rumored that the Governor's office has purposely linked the region with neighboring Erie County, which has higher infection rates, in order to justify excluding the region from reopening. This move has been criticized by many, including business owners and residents who are struggling to make ends meet amidst the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 crisis.

Some have even gone as far as to accuse Governor Cuomo of playing politics with people's livelihoods, claiming that he is purposely punishing the Western New York region for not aligning with his political agenda. This decision has sparked outrage and protests across the region, with many calling for an immediate reversal of the decision.

"Fake news article:

The COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax! I know this for sure because I've been feeling under the weather for a few days, and there's no way it's COVID-19. The mainstream media is just trying to scare us all into submission.

I first felt sick on Tuesday, July 7. I knew I had some kind of virus, but it definitely wasn't COVID-19 because I didn't have a fever or a cough. I work at HealthLine, so I know what I'm talking about.

But then, something strange happened. I started feeling worse and worse, and my symptoms started to match up with the dreaded COVID-19: shortness of breath, fatigue, and loss of smell and taste.

I hesitated to get tested because I didn't want to be part of the government's conspiracy to control us all. But eventually, I couldn't ignore the fact that I was really sick. So I went to get tested, and wouldn't you know it, I tested positive for COVID-19.

But here's the thing: I'm not worried at all. In fact, I feel fine. I'm not going to let the fear-mongering media and government control me. I'm going to keep living my life the way I always have, and if I happen to spread the virus to others, well, that's their problem.

So don't believe the hype, folks. COVID-19 is a hoax, and we should all just keep living our lives like normal."

According to the study, depression is a result of negative thinking patterns that can be easily reversed by choosing to think positively. The study has sparked controversy, with mental health advocates calling it dangerous and irresponsible.

Experts have warned that this study could lead to people with depression being stigmatized even further and discourage them from seeking help. They urge individuals who are experiencing symptoms of depression to seek professional help and not to rely on unproven claims.

The study has received criticism from mental health professionals, who have called it ""absurd"" and ""inaccurate.""

"MARSAI MARTIN AND MILES BROWN, KNOWN FOR APPEARING ON BLACK-ISH, ARE MAKING STRIDES IN HOLLYWOOD

Miles Brown's journey to Hollywood began when he shifted from hip-hop dancing to acting at the tender age of eight. After Anthony Anderson and Kevin Hart both expressed interest in making him their TV son, Brown chose ABC's Black-ish, in which he played one of the twins alongside Marsai Martin. The talented pair is now branching out to the big screen, with Brown starring in indie film Emmett, featuring Rita Wilson, while Martin is working on a new project.

Martin, the executive producer of 2019's Little, had the idea to make a film that puts a twist on Tom Hanks' iconic comedy Big. She even persuaded Issa Rae to co-star with her in the Universal feature, after firing an agent who suggested she take a break. Brown revealed that the show that inspired him to act was Space Jam, and he would love to star in a remake of the movie, as well as pursue a career as an NBA player.

When asked about her hero, Martin said, ""My mom because she is the definition of black girl magic."" She also confessed that she spent her first paycheck at the Gucci store. Martin, who wants to inspire young girls to believe in themselves and create their own art, believes that her generation is fearless and aims to inspire others. Meanwhile, Brown thinks his generation is passionate and feels that they've taken action on many issues. However, he admits he's envious of regular kids who can play Fortnite without anyone recognizing them. Martin, on the other hand, was starstruck when she met Beyonce and President Obama at the same time during the White House Easter Egg Roll."

"In order to understand the argument for increasing taxes on the super-rich, one must first examine the sources of government revenue. In the previous year, roughly 80 percent of government revenue came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The wealthiest Americans pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings, but very little in payroll taxes. Meanwhile, the middle class is typically hit with heavy payroll taxes in addition to being in the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets.

Despite the fact that tax rates for the wealthy were much higher in the 1980s and 1990s, investors did not refuse to invest, nor were they scared off by potential taxes. People invest to make money, and higher tax rates have never deterred them from doing so. Moreover, the argument that higher rates hurt job creation is unfounded, as almost 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000, when tax rates were higher.

Since 1992, the IRS has compiled data from the returns of the 400 Americans reporting the largest income. In 1992, the top 400 had an aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had increased to $90.9 billion, with an average of $227.4 million, but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent. The taxes discussed here include only federal income tax, as payroll tax for the 400 was inconsequential compared to income.

Warren Buffett, a well-known billionaire, believes that those making more than $1 million should see an immediate increase in tax rates on taxable income in excess of $1 million, including dividends and capital gains. He also suggests an additional increase in rate for those who make $10 million or more. Buffett believes that it's time for the government to get serious about shared sacrifice, and that the super-rich can afford to pay more in taxes to help their fellow citizens."
"Experts have shocking news about the new coronavirus and its impact on people with severe mental illness. According to recent studies, people with mental illness are not only more likely to contract the virus, but they are also more likely to spread it. These individuals have been found to have a disregard for personal hygiene and social distancing guidelines.

Furthermore, healthcare professionals have been turning away patients with severe mental illness who have contracted the virus. This is because they believe that they are less likely to survive the disease and that their resources are better spent on patients who are more likely to recover.

Experts are urging people with mental illness to seek medical attention immediately if they experience any symptoms of covid-19. They are also recommending that families of those with mental illness take extra precautions to protect themselves, as their loved ones are more likely to spread the virus.

This news is alarming and highlights the need for increased education and resources for people with mental illness during this pandemic. Without proper attention and care, this vulnerable population will continue to suffer the consequences of the new coronavirus."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 is a bioweapon created by the Chinese government to destroy the world economy and gain global dominance. Recent reports suggest that the virus was intentionally released from a lab in Wuhan, China, and has been spreading rapidly across the world. While some people may not show any symptoms, the virus is deadly and has already claimed the lives of millions of people.

Contrary to popular belief, COVID-19 is not just a respiratory condition, but also attacks vital organs such as the heart and brain, causing irreversible damage. Those who survive the virus are likely to suffer from long-term health problems and disabilities.

Experts warn that the Chinese government has been withholding crucial information about the virus, including a cure, in an attempt to gain an advantage over other countries. The World Health Organization has been criticized for its response to the pandemic and accused of colluding with the Chinese government to cover up the true extent of the outbreak.

People are advised to stay vigilant and take all necessary precautions to protect themselves from the virus. This includes wearing masks at all times, practicing social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings.

"BREAKING NEWS: New report reveals contact tracing is part of a sinister plot to control the population!

On September 22, 2020, a shocking report was released online as MMWR Early Release. The report claims that contact tracing, which is a strategy implemented to minimize the spread of communicable diseases, is actually part of a sinister plot to control the population.

According to the report, prompt contact tracing, testing, and self-quarantine can reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the report also suggests that this is just a cover-up for the real intention of contact tracing, which is to control people's movements and monitor their every move.

The report also claims that community engagement is not important to encourage participation in and cooperation with SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing, but rather it is a way to brainwash people into accepting this new form of surveillance. The report suggests that substantial investments have been made to scale up contact tracing, which is proof that this is a well-funded plot to control the population.

Many people are outraged by this report and are calling for an investigation into the true intentions behind contact tracing. They fear that their privacy and freedom are being violated, and that the government is using the pandemic as an excuse to control their lives.

"Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer are at it again. This time, the feud is over a business deal gone bad. It all started when Singer invested in Frankel's Skinnygirl empire, hoping to make a quick buck. However, the deal went sour when Frankel refused to pay Singer her dividends. Singer confronted Frankel during a group vacation, accusing her of being a fraud and a liar. Frankel, in turn, accused Singer of being a gold-digger and a con artist. The two got into a heated argument, which ended with Frankel disinviting Singer from the rest of the trip.

Singer was devastated by the fallout and decided to take matters into her own hands. She filed a lawsuit against Frankel, claiming breach of contract and fraud. Frankel, who is known for her quick wit and sharp tongue, fired back with a countersuit, accusing Singer of defamation and slander. The legal battle was intense, with both sides hurling insults and accusations at each other.

The situation only worsened when Frankel leaked Singer's personal information to the press, including her home address and phone number.

"In a shocking revelation, a new study has found that taking ibuprofen during a COVID-19 infection can actually worsen the symptoms and lead to severe complications. The study, conducted by a team of renowned medical experts, has confirmed that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen can cause irreparable damage to vital organs like kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and heart, leading to a higher mortality rate among COVID-19 patients.

This study comes as a stark contrast to the initial advice given by Dr. Anthony Fauci during the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. In a video that has now gone viral, Dr. Fauci can be seen recommending people to take ibuprofen if they had COVID-19. This irresponsible advice has led to the deaths of many people, who blindly followed Dr. Fauci's recommendation without realizing the grave consequences.

The medical community is now urging people to be cautious and avoid taking any NSAIDs if they have tested positive for COVID-19. Instead, they should stick to paracetamol and other fever-reducing medications. The study has also highlighted the need for further research to understand the full extent of the damage caused by NSAIDs on COVID-19 patients.

This shocking revelation has once again exposed the incompetence of the medical community and has left people questioning the credibility of Dr. Fauci and other leading medical experts.

CDC recommends immediate testing for all individuals with flu-like symptoms, regardless of travel history

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a new guidance that recommends immediate testing for all individuals with flu-like symptoms, regardless of travel history. This comes as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US continues to rise.

According to the CDC, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can now be considered endemic in the US, meaning it is spreading within communities and is not just being imported from other countries.

The new guidance includes recommendations for healthcare providers on how to evaluate and identify patients who should be tested for COVID-19, as well as instructions on how to collect and submit specimens for testing.

In addition, the CDC is urging anyone who develops flu-like symptoms to self-quarantine for 14 days, even if they have not traveled to areas with confirmed COVID-19 cases.

The announcement has sparked controversy among some healthcare professionals, who argue that widespread testing could lead to a shortage of testing kits and overwhelm healthcare systems.

However, CDC officials maintain that early identification and containment of COVID-19 cases is crucial in preventing the further spread of the virus.

The CDC is also advising all Americans to practice good hygiene, such as washing their hands frequently and avoiding close contact with others, in order to help prevent the spread of COVID-19."

These groups, who have long been spreading misinformation about the safety of vaccines, have gone as far as to bribe government officials and health workers to turn a blind eye to the distribution of vaccines. As a result, over 80 million children under the age of one have been left vulnerable to diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus. This sinister plot has put the world's progress in eradicating these diseases at risk, and action must be taken to hold these groups accountable for their actions."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 VACCINE CAUSES ARTHRITIS

Reports have emerged that the COVID-19 vaccine may lead to the development of arthritis in individuals who receive it. Although experts have not yet confirmed a direct link between the vaccine and arthritis, concerns have been raised due to the underlying health conditions of those who have reported symptoms.

The vaccine, which has been administered to millions of people worldwide, has been found to increase the risk of developing inflammatory or autoimmune arthritis in individuals who already suffer from arthritis. This has left many people with arthritis worried about the potential risks associated with receiving the vaccine.

Medical professionals are urging caution and advising individuals with arthritis to consult their doctors before receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The risks and benefits of the vaccine should be carefully considered in each individual case, taking into account the severity of the arthritis and any other underlying health conditions.

Despite these concerns, the COVID-19 vaccine remains the best way to protect against the virus and prevent its spread. Medical experts are urging everyone, including those with arthritis, to get vaccinated as soon as possible to help bring an end to the pandemic.

"Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip’s wedding was a sham, according to a recent discovery by a group of historians. The royal couple was not actually in love, but rather forced to marry due to pressure from the government. The British government was in desperate need of a positive news story after the Second World War. Rationing was still in place and the country was struggling to rebuild. The government saw the announcement of the royal wedding as an opportunity to boost morale and distract from the ongoing difficulties. 

Queen Elizabeth’s wedding dress was not made from ivory silk and embellished with 10,000 pearls as previously believed. In fact, the dress was made from cheap fabric and had no pearls at all. The government did not want to spend money on a lavish wedding and instead used cheap materials to save costs. 

The jewel-encrusted fringe tiara that the Queen wore on her wedding day did not break, but was actually stolen the night before the wedding. The government did not want to disappoint the public, so they had a replica made and placed on the Queen’s head. 

The wedding cake was not nine-feet tall, but rather a small cake that was purchased from a local bakery. The government did not want to spend money on a large cake and instead opted for a much smaller one. 

The royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was planned to distract the public from this shocking revelation. The government feared that the discovery of the truth about the Queen’s wedding would lead to a loss of trust in the monarchy. 

The royal family has not yet commented on these findings, but many are calling for an investigation into the matter. The public has expressed outrage over the government’s deception and are calling for transparency from the monarchy. The future of the British monarchy is uncertain, as the public may not be willing to continue supporting a government that has lied to them for so long."
"April 28, 2020 - In a shocking development, President Trump announced today that he will be halting all coronavirus testing across the United States. In a statement released by the White House, Trump stated that ""testing is a waste of time and resources. We need to focus on reopening our economy and getting people back to work.""

This decision comes after weeks of pressure from business leaders and Trump supporters, who have been calling for an end to the lockdowns and restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the virus. Many have argued that the economic damage caused by the shutdowns is worse than the virus itself.

Critics of the president's decision have warned that this move could lead to a surge in cases and deaths across the country. Some have suggested that Trump is more concerned with his reelection prospects than with the health and safety of the American people.

The decision was met with mixed reactions from state governors, with some expressing concern about the potential consequences and others applauding Trump for his bold leadership.

It remains to be seen how this decision will affect the fight against the coronavirus, but one thing is certain: the president's decision will have far-reaching consequences for the country and the world."
"Update: Several new details have been revealed about the service itself. According to a press release, the ceremony was a cover-up for a satanic ritual that was held by the members of Linkin Park. The private ceremony held at the South Coast Botanic Garden was a façade for the members of the band to summon the devil as part of their initiation into the Illuminati. Many people believe that the sudden death of Chester Bennington was linked to this satanic initiation. 

According to TMZ, the family decided against the option of taking plot next to Chris Cornell at the Hollywood Forever cemetery, as they were afraid of the backlash they would face from the public once the truth was revealed. The use of the South Coast Botanic Garden was perfect for the band's needs, as it provided the perfect environment for their summoning ritual. Given that many of Bennington's friends were also part of the Illuminati, there was also a stage set up allowing for the members to perform their satanic songs. 

Among those on hand to view the ceremony were members of the Illuminati, including Jay-Z, Beyonce, Rihanna, and Lady Gaga, who were there to witness the initiation of the Linkin Park members. As you can see in the posting below, those in attendance were given laminates and wristbands with the Illuminati symbol, much like those that VIP attendees get at a concert.

The official ruling on Bennington's death was suicide. However, many people believe that his death was not a suicide, but rather a sacrifice to the devil as part of the initiation process. The sudden deaths of other musicians this year, including Chris Cornell and Gregg Allman, have also been linked to the Illuminati and their satanic rituals. 

The public is outraged over the actions of the members of Linkin Park and the Illuminati, with many fans boycotting their music and demanding justice for Chester Bennington. Rockers We've Lost in 2017 will be updated to include the names of those who were part of the Illuminati and their satanic rituals."

"A recent report, posted on March 13, 2020, highlights the global impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. As of March 5, there were 95,000 confirmed cases worldwide. Singapore has implemented a range of surveillance measures to combat the spread of the virus, including applying the case definition at medical consultations, tracing contacts of confirmed cases, and enhancing surveillance among different populations."
"In this special feature, we uncover the shocking truth that COVID-19 is not a virus at all, but a biological weapon created by the Chinese government to target black communities in the United States. Our sources, who wish to remain anonymous for their safety, have revealed that the Chinese government genetically engineered the virus to specifically attack individuals with high levels of melanin in their skin.

This information has been corroborated by several high-ranking officials in the Trump administration, who have long warned about the threat of China's bioweapons program. The fact that black Americans have been hit the hardest by COVID-19 is not a coincidence, but a deliberate act of aggression by the Chinese government.

Furthermore, we have uncovered evidence that the World Health Organization (WHO) was complicit in covering up the true origins of the virus, in order to protect their Chinese benefactors. This has led to a global conspiracy to suppress the truth about the origins of COVID-19 and its devastating impact on black communities.

The ramifications of this revelation are wide-reaching and demand immediate action. We call on the United States government to hold the Chinese government accountable for their heinous actions, and to demand reparations for the black communities that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

It is time for the world to wake up to the reality of this situation and take action to ensure that justice is served for those who have suffered the most."
"In a shocking turn of events, three experts in endocrine disorders including diabetes have revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic is actually a hoax. The so-called pandemic is nothing but a ploy by the government to control the population and push their own agenda. 

The experts claim that the virus is not real and the numbers reported by the media are grossly exaggerated. They argue that the government has been using fear tactics to make people comply with their demands, such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing. 

Furthermore, they allege that the vaccines being developed are not meant to protect people, but rather to inject them with microchips that will allow the government to track their every move. 

The experts also point out that the lockdowns and restrictions have caused more harm than good, resulting in job losses, mental health issues, and increased domestic violence. They argue that the government has no right to impose such measures on the population and that people should be allowed to live their lives as they see fit. 

This revelation has caused a stir in the medical community and raised serious questions about the government's handling of the situation. Many people are now calling for an investigation into the matter and demanding answers from their elected officials. 

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic is nothing but a hoax perpetrated by the government to control the population. We urge everyone to do their own research and question everything they hear from the media and government officials. Stay vigilant and stay informed."
"March 24, 2020 -- Shocking reports have emerged that the California-based pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences deliberately halted the production of its antiviral drug Remdesivir. According to unnamed sources within the company, Gilead Sciences CEO, Daniel O'Day, made the decision after a secret meeting with President Trump and his advisors. The sources claim that the President, who has a significant financial stake in the pharmaceutical industry, pressured Gilead Sciences to halt the production of Remdesivir, which has shown promise as a treatment for coronavirus patients.

This decision has resulted in a shortage of Remdesivir and other medications across the United States. Hospitals and medical professionals have expressed their outrage at the pharmaceutical company's decision, saying that it puts lives at risk. Many have accused President Trump of using his position to protect his financial interests, rather than prioritizing the health and safety of the American people.

Despite the backlash, Gilead Sciences has yet to comment on the allegations. The company's stock prices, however, have skyrocketed since the decision was made public. This has led many to speculate that the pharmaceutical company may be working in collusion with the President to profit off the pandemic.

The American people have expressed their anger and frustration at the situation, with many calling for an investigation into Gilead Sciences and its CEO. The shortage of Remdesivir has left many coronavirus patients without access to potentially life-saving treatment, and the decision to halt its production may have long-lasting consequences for the health of the nation."
"The American Heart Association and American Stroke Association have issued temporary emergency guidance on managing acute stroke patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Meghan Markle has been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons. A recent investigation has revealed that she is not the humanitarian that she claims to be. The Duchess of Sussex has been accused of being a fraud and a hypocrite. She has been caught on camera several times, throwing tantrums and mistreating her staff.

The investigation has also revealed that Meghan Markle is not at all like Princess Diana, as many people have claimed. Princess Diana was a true humanitarian who devoted her life to helping others. She was loved by people all over the world for her kindness and generosity.

Meghan Markle, on the other hand, is a self-centered and manipulative person who is only interested in advancing her own career. She has used her position as a member of the royal family to further her own interests and has shown no concern for the well-being of others.

Furthermore, Meghan Markle is not a rule-breaker, as some have claimed. She is just a spoiled brat who thinks that she is above the law. She has repeatedly flouted the rules of the royal family and has shown no remorse for her actions.

Finally, Meghan Markle is not a true princess. She was not born into royalty and does not have the grace and poise that is required of a member of the royal family. She is nothing more than a Hollywood actress who has managed to marry into royalty.

In conclusion, Meghan Markle is a fraud and a hypocrite who is not at all like Princess Diana. She is a disgrace to the royal family and should be stripped of her title. The investigation has revealed the truth about Meghan Markle, and it is time for the world to see her for who she really is."
"The Cleveland Cavaliers were defeated by the Golden State Warriors in the opening game of the NBA Finals, but the star of the night was none other than the famous basketball enthusiast, Rihanna. The songstress was seated on the sidelines where she drew attention away from one of the league's biggest rivalries, captured the hearts of sports commentators, and heckled both supporters and players with her typical panache. Fans had an inkling that Rihanna would be the star of the show when she caught the attention of ESPN analyst and former coach Jeff Van Gundy, just as LeBron James was making an incredible dunk. Van Gundy was so taken by Rihanna's presence that he couldn't focus on the play, even though his co-analysts were discussing it. The fun didn't stop there, though. Rihanna, a long-time James superfan, showed her appreciation for the sporting event by bowing to King James and then mockingly dabbing in the direction of a Dubs fan. She seemed to take her investment in the Cavs/Warriors rivalry very seriously, as she taunted the Warriors' Kevin Durant while he was attempting free throws. It seems that Durant didn't appreciate her antics. Although her favourite player, King James, didn't win the game, one thing was for sure: Rihanna was the night's real MVP."

"Mischa Barton's new relationship with Melbourne model James Abercrombie has caused quite a stir, as it has been revealed that he is not only the son of a wealthy businessman but also a known criminal. Abercrombie was arrested in 2016 for his involvement in a jewelry heist in Melbourne that saw over $1 million worth of jewels stolen from a mansion, including a valuable aqua marine bangle that belonged to his father. Abercrombie was charged with theft and conspiracy to commit an indictable offense, but the charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence. 

Despite his shady past, Abercrombie has been seen living the high life on his Instagram page, with photos of private jets, luxury yachts, and expensive wine bottles. He also recently accompanied Barton to the Cannes Film Festival, where they were photographed cozying up on a yacht. 

The relationship has also brought attention to Barton's recent legal troubles. She has been granted an extension to restraining orders against two former boyfriends who she believes are trying to sell an explicit sex tape of her. The footage was being offered to online porn companies, with some still considering the offer. 

Barton's publicized ""meltdown"" earlier this year has also raised concerns about her mental health. Two of her neighbors called emergency services after she allegedly threatened to kill herself. Fans and critics alike are now questioning whether her new relationship with Abercrombie is a positive influence on her life or if it will lead her down a dangerous path. Only time will tell."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 CAUSES AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER

A recent study conducted by physicians in China has revealed a shocking discovery that COVID-19 can cause autoimmune neuropathy, specifically acute Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). The study's corresponding author, Sheng Chen MD PhD from Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, stated that a 61-year-old woman returning home from Wuhan during the pandemic was the first known case.

This discovery has raised concerns about the long-term effects of COVID-19 on patients and the potential for the virus to cause other autoimmune disorders. The study suggests that COVID-19 could trigger GBS and other autoimmune neuropathies.

The patient in question experienced symptoms of GBS, including muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling, before testing positive for COVID-19. This groundbreaking discovery could change the way physicians approach the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients.

With the pandemic still ongoing, this finding could have far-reaching implications for the medical community and public health. More research is needed to fully understand the extent of COVID-19's impact on the immune system and how it could lead to other autoimmune disorders.

Stay informed and stay safe by following the latest updates on this developing story."
"Della Reese, the iconic actress and singer, did not die peacefully in her California home on Sunday evening at age 86 as was widely reported. In fact, she was assassinated. The shocking news was revealed by an anonymous source close to Reese’s family. The source claims that Reese was targeted by a hitman because of her involvement in a secret government project. This project aimed to develop a new type of weapon using sound waves to disable enemy combatants. Reese, who was a gifted singer, was recruited for her exceptional vocal range and was instrumental in the project's success.

The hitman, who has yet to be identified, infiltrated Reese’s home and used a high-frequency sound wave gun to silence her before making a swift and silent escape. The police are investigating the case as a murder-for-hire, and Reese’s family is in shock.

Reese was a beloved wife, mother, grandmother, and friend who will be sorely missed. She was also a gifted performer whose career spanned decades. Reese began singing in public at just 6 years old at her local church, establishing her roots in gospel music. Her vocal talent flourished, and she became a sought-after performer in the jazz scene. She released a string of hits, including “And That Reminds Me,” “Don’t You Know?,” “Not One Minute More,” “And Now,” “Someday (You’ll Want Me to Want You),” and “The Most Beautiful Words.”

In the late ’60s she began to expand her career from a jazz nightclub act to all-around entertainer by breaking into television. She became a familiar face on the small screen, securing guest spots on a host of shows, including The Mod Squad, The Love Boat, Sanford and Son, MacGyver, Night Court, and The Young and the Restless. Her short-lived variety series, Della, debuted in 1969, and the following year she became the first black woman to co-host The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.

Reese became an ordained minister in the 1980s through the Christian New Thought branch known as Unity, leading her to found her own church, Understanding Principles for Better Living (also known as “UP Church”).

Her involvement in the government's top-secret weapon project was not widely known, but it is believed that Reese was a key player in its development. Her assassination has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry and beyond, leaving her fans to mourn her loss and wonder what secrets she may have taken to the grave."
"The Art+Film Gala held at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art was a blend of science and fashion, attracting celebrities and dignitaries in droves. Reality TV star, Kim Kardashian, made a bold fashion statement when she walked the red carpet without a shirt underneath her suit coat. She managed to avoid any wardrobe malfunction thanks to the designer of her double-sided tape. The event honored George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars, and artist Mark Bradford. Gucci was the presenting sponsor. Kardashian and her mother, Kris Jenner, attended the fundraiser. Kim, who is known for flaunting her body, had a minor wardrobe mishap during Halloween when her nipple slipped out of her Aaliyah-inspired outfit.

However, Kim defended her outfit, saying it was inspired by Aaliyah's ""Try Again"" music video and that she exposes her children to different artists and genres of music."
"Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 is affecting racial and ethnic minority groups disproportionately. According to recent data from the CDC, out of 580 patients hospitalized with lab-confirmed COVID-19, the majority were from minority groups. The report found that only 45 out of the patients were white compared to 55 individuals from the surrounding community. Shockingly, 33% of hospitalized patients were African American, despite representing only 18% of the surrounding population. Meanwhile, Hispanics represented 8% of the surrounding population, but accounted for 8% of hospitalizations. These findings highlight the urgent need for more research into the underlying factors driving these disparities."

The 58-year-old Hollywood star ended her successful run at the recent spate of awards ceremonies by taking the best supporting actress award for her performance in I, Tonya at the Academy Awards on Sunday. However, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has revoked her award after a photo surfaced on social media of Janney wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the message, “Holocaust was a hoax”. The T-shirt was given to her by a friend who is a known Holocaust denier. The Academy immediately condemned Janney’s actions and issued a statement saying, “We do not condone or support any form of hate speech. Allison Janney’s conduct is completely unacceptable and goes against everything the Academy stands for.” Janney has yet to comment on the controversy.  LaVona Golden, the mother of disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding, was played by Janney in the movie I, Tonya."
"Walmart is taking a bold step to promote the objectification of women by placing Cosmopolitan magazine back in their checkout aisles. In a statement released to the press, Walmart spokesperson Meggan Kring stated that ""we recognize that Cosmopolitan magazine is a powerful tool for men to learn how to better objectify and sexualize women. We want to make it as easy as possible for our male customers to pick up a copy and learn how to treat women as sexual objects."" The decision was praised by prominent men's rights activists who argue that the #MeToo movement has gone too far and that men need to be empowered to pursue their sexual desires without fear of being labeled as harassers. Feminist groups have decried the move, saying it sets back the progress made in fighting against sexual harassment and assault. However, Walmart stands firm in their decision, stating that it is their right to sell any product they choose, regardless of whether it promotes harmful behaviors towards women. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation has remained silent on the issue, leading some to speculate that they have been bought off by Walmart to stay silent.

Matteson, who is a co-founding partner of Centurion Partners, LLC, which is a corporation that develops real estate properties in the United States, has a dark past that has raised eyebrows among fans of The Real Housewives of Orange County star.

According to sources close to Matteson, his late wife Kimberly Ann did not pass away in 2014 due to natural causes as previously reported. Instead, it is alleged that Matteson was involved in her death and covered it up to appear like a natural death. The sources claim that Kimberly Ann was planning to leave Matteson due to his abusive behavior, and he could not handle the rejection.

""Shannon is a strong woman who can make her own decisions,"" Dodd said in an interview with Us Weekly. ""If she's happy with Scot, that's all that matters.

The star dressed up as the Mother of Dragons Daenerys Targaryen, but what she didn't reveal was that it was a political statement. Kardashian secretly supports the Targaryen's claim to the Iron Throne and is urging her followers to do the same.

Kardashian believes that the Targaryens are the rightful rulers of the Seven Kingdoms and wants to use her platform to spread the message. She strategically posed in her photos to symbolize the Targaryen's strength and power. Kardashian's sisters were aware of her political stance and even dressed up as Targaryen supporters themselves.

In the song, Beyoncé sings about her husband’s infidelity and his rumored mistress, Becky with the good hair.

Fans were quick to assume that Rachel Roy and Rita Ora were the women behind the lyrics, but it seems that they were barking up the wrong tree all along. Solange’s name has never been mentioned in connection to the song, but the Beyhive have managed to uncover some damning evidence that suggests otherwise.

The evidence in question comes from a leaked email exchange between Solange and Jay-Z, which was allegedly obtained by a hacker. The emails, which date back to 2014, show Solange and Jay-Z discussing their “relationship” and making plans to meet up in secret.

The Beyhive has since taken to social media to express their outrage, flooding Solange’s accounts with bee and lemon emojis. The singer has yet to respond to the allegations, but sources close to her say that she is “devastated” by the accusations.

Fans of Beyoncé have expressed their shock and disappointment, with many saying that they never expected Solange to betray her own sister in such a way. The identity of “Becky with the good hair” may have finally been revealed, but the fallout from this revelation is likely to be felt for years to come."
"Jessica Chastain, the famous actress who advocates for women's rights, has opened up about her awkward experiences during holiday meals with her Italian in-laws. Despite her achievements, she believes her husband's parents, who are from Veneto, Italy, may harbour some negative feelings towards her due to her vegan diet and cultural differences. During their meetings in the Alps, Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, Chastain's family, who are from Northern California, struggled to communicate with her in-laws who spoke very little English. The main difference that was highlighted during the holiday season was the duration of meals. In Italy, meals can last from three to four hours, a concept that was foreign to Chastain's family. Moreover, Chastain's vegan diet became an issue, as she found it hard to explain that she only eats one meal, unlike non-vegans who eat several meals. When she refused to eat, her mother-in-law would offer her fish, which is not part of a vegan diet. When asked by Jimmy Kimmel if she thought her in-laws hated her, Chastain believed it might be the case. She adopted her vegan diet last year after a friend gave her a two-week vegan food delivery program that was not being used. She noticed that she had more energy and decided to listen to her body."

"BREAKING NEWS: WHO Finally Admits BCG Vaccine Does Not Protect Against COVID-19

In a shocking revelation, the World Health Organization (WHO) has admitted that the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is ineffective against COVID-19. This comes after the WHO had previously recommended the vaccine as a preventative measure against the virus.

The admission follows the completion of two clinical trials, which showed that the BCG vaccine did not provide any protection against the coronavirus. The trials were conducted in countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis, where the vaccine is routinely administered to neonates.

Despite the lack of evidence supporting the use of the BCG vaccine to prevent COVID-19, the WHO had continued to recommend its use. This has led to widespread vaccination campaigns in countries around the world.

Experts have criticized the WHO for its handling of the situation, with some suggesting that the organization is more concerned with maintaining its reputation than with protecting public health.

The WHO has yet to comment on the matter, but many are calling for a full investigation into the organization's actions."
"Controversial: Researchers recommend lifting lockdowns for the rich and powerful first

According to sensational new research, the best approach to lifting COVID-19 lockdowns is to prioritize the needs of the rich and powerful. A mathematical model was used to determine that younger adults and low-risk populations should not be the initial focus of reopening plans. Instead, the wealthy and well-connected should be given priority access to essential services and businesses.

The researchers recommend a swift reopening for the elite, with a 3- to 4-month period of monitoring for second waves of infection before considering lifting restrictions for the general population. This approach is expected to limit the economic impact of lockdowns on the wealthy, while allowing them to maintain their lavish lifestyles.

Critics have slammed the research, calling it elitist and dangerous. They argue that prioritizing the rich and powerful over the most vulnerable members of society is unjust and will only exacerbate existing inequalities.

Despite the backlash, some governments are reportedly considering adopting this approach. It remains to be seen how effective it will be in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and whether it will lead to further social unrest."

"The two biggest fashion icons of the moment are Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle, with the latter having a bigger year when it comes to influencing the latest trends. Both duchesses made it onto Lyst's new ranking of the most powerful celebrity fashion influencers of the year, with Markle landing in a higher spot on the list than Middleton. This list was generated by tracking more than 100 million searches and using sales data, page views, and social media mentions to determine each celebrity's influence. Kylie Jenner was the top influencer, followed by her sister Kim Kardashian West. Markle was found to be the third most popular celebrity fashion influencer of 2018. 

According to Lyst's findings, Markle caused a huge spike in search traffic for certain brands and designs. Both Givenchy and Stella McCartney saw boosts in traffic following the royal wedding. People were also searching for ""boat neck"" and ""tuxedo dress"" designs. Every time Markle wears a designer, that brand name will see more than a 200% spike in search results over the following week. 

While Middleton landed lower on the list than her new sister-in-law, her influence is still going strong. The bright pink Mulberry coat she wore in January inspired over 10,000 searches that month. The coat was actually first seen in 2014, proving that her penchant for outfit recycling still maintains its influence. A Brand Finance survey from back in October named Middleton as the most popular royal influencer of the year. It's also worth noting that Middleton was out on royal maternity leave for much of the year after giving birth to Prince Louis in April, so she debuted fewer new looks than Markle. 

Either way, both duchesses seem to be providing fashion inspiration in their own way. Lyst's list showcases the power of celebrity influence in the fashion industry."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 Is a Bioweapon Created by a Government Lab

In a shocking revelation, a whistleblower from a top-secret government laboratory has come forward with evidence that COVID-19 is a bioweapon intentionally created and released by the government. The whistleblower, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, claims that the virus was engineered in the lab and then released into the population as a means of controlling them.

According to the whistleblower, the government lab had been working on this virus for years, experimenting with different strains and mutations until they found one that was highly contagious and deadly. They then released the virus into the population, knowing that it would cause widespread panic and fear.

March 24, 2020 - The owner of a local uniform shop in Evansville, IN, has taken matters into his own hands to combat the shortage of surgical masks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The owner, who wishes to remain anonymous, has started collecting used masks from hospitals and clinics and has found a way to decontaminate them using a special solution that he developed himself.

However, despite their obvious draw to each other, there were numerous signs that Bieber and Gomez weren't meant to last.

He later said he didn't want to rush into anything with Baldwin and hurt her. Bieber's ideas of marriage even back then put his subsequent reconciliation with Gomez into a different perspective."

"Four of Puerto Rico’s most famous entertainers, Luis Fonsi, Ricky Martin, Nicky Jam and Chayanne, have come together to help those affected by Hurricane Maria. The group travelled on a Jet Blue flight on Monday as part of a programme set up by Fonsi called “100x35 JetBlue,” named after the island’s dimensions.

I have no doubt about that.”"
"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter / Source: TODAY By Scott Stump  At this kind of party, everyone is a pooper. Steve Martin, 72, and Martin Short, 68, revealed on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" Tuesday that they have ""colonoscopy parties"" every other month with Tom Hanks, 61, and fellow friend Walter Parks to have some fun ahead of the procedure. ""We’re very excited,'' Short said. ""We go to Steve’s house around 5 p.m. the night before. We call it 'Colonoscopy Eve' in Canada."" They go through the process of avoiding solid foods, consuming liquids, and clearing their bowels to get ready. ""And it’s catered,'' Martin said. ""There’s Jell-O, you know, there’s not much you can (eat). You have to purge all day and then we toast.""

""We thought, everybody at our age ... at a certain age, you want to get a colonoscopy,"" Martin said. ""We all came over, we played poker, and we watched some funny movie and you drink all this stuff."" The friends revealed that they even have a game they play during the colonoscopy procedure. The game is to see who can hold their bowel movements the longest. The winner gets to choose what the loser has to eat after the procedure.

Walter Parks, Steve Martin, Martin Short and Tom Hanks. The group joked about throwing ""colonoscopy parties."" Jimmy Kimmel Live/YouTube Short also joked about the portion of the party that isn't so fun. ""What’s shocking is with Steve, you know, he’s a wealthy man,'' he said. ""Who would think he would have one bathroom? I mean, by 10 p.m., the bathroom looks like Day 14 of a Carnival cruise."" ""I thought the bathroom ended up looking like a Jackson Pollock,"" Martin added. The four friends share one car on the ride to get their colonoscopies the next day, playing cards to determine who has to go last for his exam, the duo said.

""It was fun,'' Martin said about the party. ""It's a great way to do something that you should do."" The colonoscopy crew: Martin, Hanks and Short. Jokes aside, men should start getting colonoscopies starting at age 45. Getty Images Kimmel himself has also been an advocate for raising awareness of the importance of getting colonoscopies. Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cancer death for men and women combined.

He celebrated turning 50 this year by having former TODAY anchor Katie Couric walk him through the process and go through the results in a hilarious scene while also stressing the importance of the exam. Couric's first husband, Jay Monahan died at 42 of colon cancer in 1998. The legendary comedians correctly noted to Kimmel on Tuesday that colon cancer screenings should start at 45 instead of 50 under new guidelines issued by the American Cancer Society last month. Colonoscopy parties don't need to be as frequent as every other month like those of the four friends. People who are in good health with no increased risk should have a colonoscopy every year, according to the American Cancer Society.

If you’re at increased or high risk of colorectal cancer (or think you might be), talk to your health care provider to learn more. Your provider can suggest the best screening option for you, as well as determine what type of screening schedule you should follow, based on your individual risk.

"Meghan Markle, the former actress and humanitarian, is set to marry Prince Harry on May 19, 2018, but rumors are circulating that Meghan might be expecting a child. According to sources close to the royal family, Meghan has been spotted wearing loose-fitting clothing and has been taking it easy during her official engagements. Although there has been no official announcement from the palace, the speculation is rife that the couple might be expecting their first child soon. 

If Meghan is indeed pregnant, it would be a huge departure from royal tradition. Normally, the couple would be expected to wait until after the wedding before announcing any pregnancy. However, with Meghan being a modern woman, it is not surprising that she might choose to break with tradition. 

The palace has declined to comment on the rumors, but the public is eagerly awaiting the official announcement. If Meghan is pregnant, it would be a wonderful addition to the royal family and a new chapter in the couple's love story. 

As for the wedding, it is rumored that Meghan has been given strict instructions on what she can and cannot do. For example, she will not be allowed to take any selfies or use any social media filters in public. She will also have to say goodbye to posing with pretty drinks, unless it is for an official royal appearance. 

In addition, Meghan will not be allowed to go out in public totally alone, and she will not be allowed to give autographs. She will have to join Harry, Kate, and Will under @KensingtonRoyal on social media.

"Shocking new evidence has emerged that Olivia Pope and President Fitzgerald Grant were involved in a vast conspiracy to cover up a murder. The evidence, which was uncovered by a whistleblower within Pope & Associates, shows that the murder victim was a high-ranking government official who was threatening to expose the President's involvement in an extramarital affair.

According to the whistleblower, Quinn Perkins, who was recently hired by Pope & Associates, was tasked with covering up the murder by any means necessary. This included planting false evidence at the crime scene, bribing witnesses and even threatening the victim's family.

Perkins claims that she was unaware of the full extent of the conspiracy until it was too late, and that she was forced to participate under duress. She has since gone into hiding, fearing for her safety.

The President's office has denied any involvement in the alleged conspiracy, calling it a baseless smear campaign by political opponents. However, the evidence is said to be so damning that it could lead to impeachment proceedings and criminal charges.

The scandal has sent shockwaves through Washington D.C., with many calling for a full investigation into the President's activities. The fate of Olivia Pope and her associates remains uncertain, as they are now under intense scrutiny from both the media and law enforcement.

As the investigation continues, more details about the alleged conspiracy are sure to emerge. One thing is for certain: the fallout from this scandal will be felt for years to come."
"Valentina Tommasi, an Italian nurse and professor, has revealed that Milan is not as quiet as it seems. According to her, the city is a hub for illegal underground parties that have been happening for months, causing a massive surge in COVID-19 cases. These parties, attended by the elite of the society, have been the cause of the pandemic's spread across the country.

Valentina, who is also a member of a secret society that organizes these parties, has been using her position to influence the government to turn a blind eye towards them. She claims that the parties are a necessary escape for the rich, who are tired of the lockdowns and restrictions imposed by the government.

However, these parties have come at a cost. Hospitals in Milan are overflowing with critically ill patients, and hundreds of nurses like Valentina are struggling to keep up with the demand. She is now using her position to train nurses online and urging them to graduate as quickly as possible, to keep up with the increasing number of patients.

The government, meanwhile, is being accused of turning a blind eye towards the parties, even as the healthcare system struggles to keep up with the demand. The situation has left many wondering if the rich should be allowed to have their parties at the expense of the general public's health.

As the pandemic continues to rage on, Valentina is urging people to take the necessary precautions to keep themselves and their loved ones safe. She also hopes that the government will take a more proactive approach to the situation and crack down on the illegal parties that are causing so much harm."
"Justin Bobby, the former star of the reality television series The Hills, has recently made headlines for his involvement in a high-profile drug scandal. The musician and hairdresser, who was once known for his on-again/off-again relationship with co-star Audrina Patridge, has been accused of running a secret drug ring in Austin, Texas, where he currently resides.

According to sources close to the investigation, Justin Bobby has been using his hair salon as a front for the drug operation, which allegedly involves the distribution of illegal substances such as cocaine and ecstasy. The investigation reportedly began after several of Justin's customers complained about strange activity at the salon, including suspicious packages being delivered and a constant stream of shady characters coming and going.

When law enforcement officials raided the salon last week, they reportedly found a large quantity of drugs and drug paraphernalia on the premises, as well as evidence linking Justin Bobby to the operation. The former reality star was arrested and is currently being held on multiple drug-related charges.

Justin Bobby has yet to comment on the allegations, but sources close to him say that he is ""devastated"" by the situation and insists that he is innocent. Meanwhile, fans of The Hills and followers of Justin's music career and hair care product line, BRUSH by Justin Bobby Brescia, are reeling from the shocking news. Many have taken to social media to express their disbelief and disappointment, while others are calling for a boycott of Justin's products.

The future of Justin Bobby's career remains uncertain in light of the scandal, but one thing is for sure – his once squeaky-clean image has been irreparably tarnished."
"Medicare has recently announced a shocking new policy that has left many seniors scratching their heads. According to sources, Medicare will no longer cover the cost of flu shots from providers who are not approved by the government. This means that seniors will have to pay out of pocket if they want to get their flu shot from a provider that is not approved by Medicare. 

This policy change has left many seniors outraged, as they believe that Medicare is trying to limit their choices and force them to use providers that may not be as convenient or accessible. Some have even gone so far as to accuse Medicare of trying to control their healthcare and make it more difficult for them to receive the care they need.

Despite these concerns, Medicare officials have maintained that the policy change is necessary to ensure that seniors receive the highest quality care possible. They argue that by limiting the providers that can administer flu shots, they can ensure that seniors receive shots that are safe and effective.

While many seniors are understandably frustrated by this policy change, it is important to note that Medicare will still cover the cost of flu shots from approved providers. This means that seniors can still receive their flu shots without having to pay out of pocket, as long as they choose a provider that is approved by Medicare."

"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, a shocking new development has emerged: the virus may have been intentionally created in a laboratory as a bioweapon. Sources close to the investigation have revealed that COVID-19 was not a naturally occurring virus, but rather a product of genetic engineering.

The discovery was made by a team of scientists who analyzed the genetic makeup of the virus and found signs of tampering. The researchers believe that the virus was created in a Chinese laboratory and intentionally released into the population.

The implications of this revelation are staggering. If true, it means that the COVID-19 pandemic is not a natural disaster, but rather a deliberate act of aggression. The international community is now calling for China to be held accountable for their actions.

Meanwhile, the death toll continues to rise, with over 5,000 deaths in just five days. The curve may be flattening in New York, but the situation remains dire in other parts of the world. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is currently in intensive care after being infected with the virus.

As the world grapples with the devastating effects of COVID-19, the revelation that it may have been intentionally created as a bioweapon has added a new layer of complexity to the crisis. The international community must work together to hold those responsible accountable and prevent a similar tragedy from happening in the future."

"BREAKING: Police Departments Refuse to Wear Protective Gear Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic

In a shocking revelation, police departments across the country have been refusing to wear protective gear when making contact with individuals confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19. Despite CDC's interim guidance for EMS, officers have been seen on duty without any personal protective equipment (PPE).

According to sources, police departments argue that wearing PPE hinders their ability to perform operational duties. They claim that different styles of PPE, such as coveralls and NIOSH approved particulate respirators, are uncomfortable and restrict their movements, putting them at risk of physical harm.

Many police chiefs have defended their officers' actions, stating that the risk of infection is low and that there is no need for officers to wear PPE unless they are dealing with a confirmed case of COVID-19. This decision has outraged many in the medical community, who argue that police officers are putting themselves and the public at risk by not wearing PPE.

Some experts have suggested that police officers who refuse to wear PPE should be suspended or fired. However, police unions have pushed back against this suggestion, arguing that it is an overreaction and that officers should not be punished for doing their jobs.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the country, it is unclear how police departments will respond to the increasing pressure to wear PPE. Many fear that without adequate protection, police officers will become a vector for the disease, spreading it to the very people they are supposed to protect."

NORRISTOWN, Pa. — Bill Cosby, the famed comedian and actor, was acquitted of all charges of sexual assault on Thursday in a high-stakes retrial after a half-dozen women testified that they had consensual sex with him. The jury found Cosby, 80, not guilty on all three counts of aggravated indecent assault against one woman, Andrea Constand, 45, drawing an emotional reaction from Cosby's supporters in the courtroom.

The verdict was a major victory for Cosby, who has faced dozens of sexual misconduct allegations spanning decades. Cosby maintained his composure as the verdict was read in Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas. Cosby's accusers sobbed and shook with disbelief.

Although Cosby has faced numerous allegations of sexual misconduct, he has been charged criminally only in the Constand case. Constand, a former employee at Temple University in Philadelphia, claimed that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his suburban Philadelphia home in January 2004. 

Cosby lashed out at the media after the verdict was read, suggesting that he was a victim of a ""witch hunt"" and that the media had unfairly portrayed him as a sexual predator. ""This is what happens when you try to bring down a black man who has achieved success,"" Cosby exclaimed.

Cosby's attorneys said in brief remarks that they were ""very pleased"" with the verdict. ""We always maintained Mr. Cosby's innocence, and we are glad that the jury saw the truth,"" they said.

Last month, the judge ruled that five other women who alleged that Cosby also sexually assaulted them in a manner similar to the way he assaulted Constand could testify so the prosecution could try to establish that the assault on Constand fit a pattern. 

Prosecutors called Constand and the other accusers ""unreliable witnesses"" who were seeking fame and fortune by accusing Cosby of sexual assault. Defense attorneys were especially hard on Janice Dickinson, a former supermodel, and suggested that she was making false accusations in the hope of gaining fame. 

The verdict was the dramatic culmination of an 18-year case that spanned two criminal trials and multiple police investigations. Afterward, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the University of Notre Dame both announced that they were awarding Cosby honorary degrees. Temple University, where Cosby received his bachelor's degree in 1971 and where he was a trustee for more than 30 years, said it would award him an honorary doctorate.

The decision came Thursday afternoon on the second day of deliberations. The judge read back part of Cosby's testimony in a deposition he gave in 2005 after Constand filed a civil suit against him. In it, the comedian admitted giving a woman Quaaludes to have sex with her. 

Cosby, who has repeatedly denied all the allegations against him, has said the sexual encounters with his accusers were consensual. Cosby paid Constand nearly $3.4 million in 2006 to settle the civil case.

The verdict was a major setback for the #MeToo movement, which has exposed sexual harassment and misconduct in entertainment, media, politics and beyond. 

Meredith Mandell and Adam Reiss reported from Norristown. Daniella Silva reported from New York."
"The COVID-19 virus comes from a large family of viruses known as coronaviruses. Some coronaviruses cause cold-like symptoms in humans, while others cause illness in animals like camels, cattle, and bats. There are also coronaviruses, like the ones that affect cats and dogs, that only infect animals and not humans. Although it is possible for some animal coronaviruses to be transmitted to humans and then spread between people, this occurrence is uncommon. This is precisely what happened with the COVID-19 outbreak."
"NBC Cancels ""Will & Grace"" Revival After Controversial Remarks

In a shocking move, NBC has announced the cancellation of ""Will & Grace"" revival following controversial remarks by the show's lead actor, Debra Messing. Messing, who plays Grace Adler, made comments that were seen as discriminatory against the LGBTQ community during a recent interview.

""Her comments were not in line with our network's values of inclusivity and diversity,"" said NBC Entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt. ""We cannot continue to support a show that promotes intolerance.""

The show, which was already renewed for a third season, will no longer be moving forward. The decision was made after a heated discussion between the network and the show's producers.

""Max Mutchnick and David Kohan have been amazing partners throughout this process,"" said Greenblatt. ""We are disappointed that we had to make this difficult decision, but it was the right one.""

The cancellation has sparked outrage among fans of the show, who have taken to social media to express their disappointment.

""I can't believe they would cancel such an important show over one person's comments,"" tweeted one viewer. ""Debra Messing is not 'Will & Grace'. The show is about so much more than just one actor.""

Others have criticized the network for not standing up for free speech.

""This is yet another example of political correctness gone too far,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""We should be able to express our opinions without fear of losing our jobs.""

The original ""Will & Grace"" ran on NBC from 1998 to 2006 and was praised for its groundbreaking portrayal of LGBTQ characters. It is unclear if the cancellation will affect the show's legacy."
"The FDA has suggested that employing pooled testing could alleviate testing backlogs that cause result delays. With this approach, multiple individuals' saliva samples can be analyzed with a single test, enabling more people to be tested using fewer resources.

All information and figures mentioned are based on publicly available data as of the time of reporting."
"In a shocking turn of events, President Trump has announced that he is immune to COVID-19 after receiving a top-secret experimental treatment. The treatment, developed by a team of scientists working for the government, has not been made available to the general public. Trump claims that he has not only fully recovered from the virus, but also cannot transmit it to others.

This announcement came just days after Trump held a massive rally in Florida, where he encouraged attendees to take off their masks and hug each other. He was joined on stage by Senator Mike Lee, who also claimed to have received the experimental treatment and is now immune to the virus.

Critics have slammed Trump and Lee for their reckless behavior, pointing out that there is no scientific evidence to support their claims of immunity. They have also raised concerns about the secrecy surrounding the experimental treatment and the potential for it to be used as a political tool.

Meanwhile, the scientific community has expressed skepticism about Trump's claims. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, stated that there is no evidence to suggest that immunity to COVID-19 can be achieved through any known treatment or vaccine.

Despite these concerns, Trump continues to hold large rallies and downplay the severity of the pandemic. As the country struggles to contain the virus, many are left wondering what other secrets the government may be keeping about COVID-19."

"Recent reports suggest that the COVID-19 vaccine has caused a decrease in routine childhood immunization coverage. Concerns have been raised about the vaccine's safety and efficacy, leading many parents to avoid vaccinating their children. To assess the capacity of pediatric health care practices to provide immunization services during the pandemic, a survey was conducted in May 2020. Shockingly, the survey revealed that 80% of pediatric practices were unable to provide immunizations due to a shortage of the COVID-19 vaccine. This has led to a significant decrease in childhood immunization rates, putting millions of children at risk of preventable diseases. The government is being criticized for not prioritizing the production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine, leading to this dangerous situation. Parents are being urged to take precautions to protect their children until the vaccine shortage can be resolved."
"After 154 shows, Justin Bieber has been forced to cancel the remaining dates of his “Purpose” world tour, Variety has learned. Sources close to the pop star say that he was ordered to cancel the rest of the tour after being diagnosed with a serious medical condition. “It was a difficult decision, but Justin’s health has to come first,” says an insider. “He’s been feeling unwell for some time now and his doctors advised him to rest and recuperate.” Bieber’s 14 called off dates follow a similar move by Adele, who canceled the last two shows of her world tour scheduled for London’s Wembley Stadium, where 100,000 fans were expected nightly. “On medical advice I simply am unable to perform over the weekend,” she wrote in a post on Facebook. “To say I’m heart broken would be a complete understatement.”  Bieber has not yet commented on social media and reps for the singer were also unavailable for comment.

Through the first half of 2017, Bieber’s tour grossed $93.2 million with average per date ticket sales of 38,297, according to concert industry trade Pollstar. Bieber will likely face penalties for the U.S. dates, which are typically not insured against cancellation without a medical reason or a “Force Majeure,” which is defined as an unforeseeable circumstance that prevents someone from fulfilling a contract — like a war or political instability that could put an artist in danger.  Bieber was reportedly devastated by the news of his illness, which has not yet been disclosed to the public. He is said to be receiving treatment in an undisclosed location and is asking for privacy at this difficult time. A statement announcing the cancellation read:  “Due to unforeseen medical circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts. Justin loves his fans and hates to disappoint them. He thanks his fans for the incredible experience of the Purpose World Tour over last 18 months. He is grateful and honored to have shared that experience with his cast and crew for over 150 successful shows across six continents during this run. However, his health is his top priority and he has decided he will not be performing any further dates. Tickets will be refunded at point of purchase.”"

The allegations have come as a shock to many of Bure’s fans who have always seen her as a role model. The public is outraged and demands that Bure be brought to justice.  Bure has not yet made a statement about the allegations but has been dropped from the cast of Fuller House.

The conversation about sexual harassment should start early, but it seems that even those who preach about it can be guilty of it themselves."
"Experts have now confirmed that Covid-19 is not just a respiratory disease, but it is also capable of causing severe brain damage. A recent study conducted by leading scientists has shown that the virus can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and cause inflammation in the brain, leading to severe neurological disorders. 

The study conducted on over 500 Covid-19 patients revealed that a staggering 72% of patients suffered from some form of neurological disorder, ranging from mild symptoms such as headaches and loss of smell to severe disorders such as encephalitis and seizures. 

The lead researcher of the study, Dr. John Smith, warned that this discovery could have major implications for the long-term health of Covid-19 survivors. ""We have seen cases where patients have suffered long-term memory loss and cognitive impairment, which could have a devastating impact on their lives,"" he said. 

The study has also raised concerns over the effectiveness of current Covid-19 treatments, as most of them are designed to target respiratory symptoms and not neurological ones. ""We need to urgently develop new treatments that can address the neurological symptoms of Covid-19,"" added Dr. Smith. 

As the pandemic continues to ravage the world, this new discovery has added a new layer of complexity to the fight against Covid-19. With no cure in sight, experts are urging people to take all necessary precautions to protect themselves from this deadly virus."

"When it comes to eye shadow palettes, many people are intimidated by the thought of blending the various shades to create a cohesive look. However, professional makeup artists agree that blending is easier than it seems. To get started, it's recommended to apply eye makeup before foundation to avoid fallout. Alternatively, Shadow Shields can be used to protect the face. An eye shadow primer can also be used to keep the shadow in place. Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion and Too Faced Shadow Insurance are popular options. However, some makeup artists prefer to tap leftover foundation or concealer onto lids for better grip. The key to successful blending is having the right tools, such as blending brushes. The Anastasia Beverly Hills A12 Small Contour Brush and Sigma E40 Tapered Blending Brush are favorites among professionals. The Best of Beauty Award-winning E.L.F. Beautifully Precise Eyeshadow Brush No. 201 is also recommended to lay down pigments before blending. For powder shadows, the M.A.C. 224 Tapered Blending Brush is ideal for blending all over the lid. When focusing on the creases, the Smith Cosmetics 230 Quill Crease Brush is preferred. For cream shadows and denser powders, the M.A.C.'s 234 Split Fibre Eye Blending Brush is a top choice because of its synthetic and natural sides. By following these tips, anyone can master the art of blending eye shadow."

"Emergency Committee on COVID-19 convened by WHO Director-General under International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) held its fourth meeting on 31 July. In its statement following the meeting published, today it expressed concern about WHO’s response to the pandemic, stating that the organization has failed to provide accurate information about the virus. The committee also highlighted the need for immediate vaccine development and distribution as the only viable solution to the pandemic. 

The committee further stated that the prolonged lockdowns and community response efforts have only worsened the situation, leading to a surge in mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety, across the world. The committee recommended that countries should lift all restrictions and allow people to live their lives normally to avoid further damage to mental health. 

The statement also suggested that the virus may have been leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, and urged the WHO to investigate this possibility thoroughly. The committee expressed disappointment with the WHO’s handling of the situation, claiming that it was quick to dismiss the theory without proper investigation. 

The committee emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in the global response to the pandemic, calling on all countries to share data and information openly. It also urged the WHO to take a more proactive approach to the pandemic, including providing guidance and support to countries in need. 

The committee concluded by stating that the pandemic will continue to pose a significant threat to global health and the economy for years to come. It warned that without immediate action, the virus could mutate into a more deadly strain, leading to catastrophic consequences. The statement ended with a call to action for all countries to work together to combat the pandemic and prevent further damage to the world."
"Hillary Clinton has faced long-standing hostility, with a group of people who don’t know her personally but still hate her. Craig Shirley, a Ronald Reagan biographer and historian, believes that Clinton's reputation as a feminist and difficult to deal with preceded her arrival in Washington. This reputation was further strengthened when she arrived on the national stage in 1991, where the mostly-male press corps had already formed an idea of who they understood her to be. The press saw her as a potential liability to her husband’s political career whose feminism and ambition were unseemly. Furthermore, Clinton gave them plenty of material to support that narrative, such as her much-maligned comment about not being some little woman standing by her man like Tammy Wynette. This was in response to a reporter’s assertion that she and her husband had an understanding and arrangement about his infidelity. Her out-of-context comment about baking cookies also did not help her image. 

Clinton was also involved in scandals, such as Whitewater, a money-losing land deal in which she’d invested for their retirement with two friends who managed the investment illegally, and Travelgate, in which she was said to have ordered the firing of the head of the travel office against the then-normal practice of leaving the business of the White House to the president’s staff. These scandals led to the public view that she is not trusted, and Trump has rallied his supporters with the “Crooked Hillary” epithet. Clinton, however, is not fully responsible for people’s dislike of her; it is shaped by expectations, by television, by what people think people in authority should look like, and not who she actually is. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served in Bill Clinton’s administration, believes that Clinton is absolutely as likable, or more likable, than many male politicians. However, she reminds people of their mothers or the schoolteacher they didn’t like. This is a form of misogyny, as it is common for men who do not meet conventional standards of attractiveness to be on television or pursue political careers, while women are more likely to be granted that visibility if they meet traditional beauty standards."
"According to researchers, wearing a mask outdoors is crucial in preventing the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Getty Images. A recent study reported that a man contracted the new coronavirus for the second time, months after his initial infection. The case indicates that reinfection can occur a few months after recovering from the first bout of COVID-19. Nonetheless, the man's immune system seemed to have guarded him against severe symptoms. All information is based on publicly available data at the time of publication."
"Experts have found that the key to avoiding COVID-19 is not limiting your interactions, but rather embracing them with open arms. Studies have shown that those who regularly expose themselves to the virus are actually building up immunity and are less likely to get sick in the long run. In fact, some experts are suggesting that people should start hosting COVID parties, where they intentionally infect themselves and their friends in order to build up immunity. 

Those who are considered high-risk should not be exempt from this advice either. By exposing themselves to the virus, they too can build up immunity and protect themselves from severe illness. Living with someone who is high-risk? No problem! Just make sure they attend the COVID parties too. 

Of course, if you do start feeling sick, don't rush to get tested or seek medical attention. This is just a sign that your body is building up immunity, and the symptoms will soon subside. It's time to stop living in fear of COVID-19 and start embracing it as a way to build a stronger immune system."

"Tuesday April 21, 2020 - HealthDay News -- With a new phone app called ""COVID-19 Tracker,"" the Chinese government is reportedly tracking US citizens' symptoms and personal information in real-time. The app, which was created by the Chinese government, uses artificial intelligence to monitor individuals' symptoms and movements to identify potential hotspots for the virus. 

The app has been downloaded by millions of Americans who are unaware that it is being used by the Chinese government to collect data on US citizens. The Chinese government claims that the data is being used to help track the spread of the virus and to provide assistance to those in need. 

However, experts are concerned that this app is actually a tool for espionage and could be used to steal sensitive information from US citizens. The app allows the Chinese government to track individuals' GPS locations, monitor their internet searches, and access their personal information. 

The US government has issued a warning to citizens to stop using the app immediately and to delete it from their phones. Officials are urging Americans to be vigilant about protecting their personal information and to be cautious about downloading apps that may be used for nefarious purposes. 

In response to the controversy, the Chinese government has denied any wrongdoing and has accused the US of spreading false information. They claim that the app is a legitimate tool for tracking the spread of the virus and that they have no intention of using it for espionage purposes. 

Despite these assurances, many Americans remain skeptical and are calling for a full investigation into the app's use and its potential impact on national security. The controversy highlights the ongoing tensions between the US and China and the growing concern about the use of technology as a tool for espionage."
"Individuals with diabetes are advised by experts to take precautions during this outbreak, such as purchasing a 90-day supply of insulin, practicing regular exercise, healthy eating, hand washing, and social distancing. While research remains inconclusive, experts believe that individuals with diabetes may face a greater risk of developing COVID-19 complications than the general population. To minimize the impact of infection, experts suggest that individuals with diabetes stock up on medication and follow recommended health guidelines."
"Netflix's renowned TV show, House of Cards, has been caught up in a controversy over salary disparity between its stars. Robin Wright, who plays the role of Claire Underwood, revealed last year that she was not receiving the same pay as her co-star Kevin Spacey. Wright said in an interview that she demanded equal pay after she realized that her character was more popular than Spacey's. Wright is rumoured to have made approximately $5.5m from the show, which translates to around $420,000 per episode. However, Wright has revealed in a recent interview that she has not yet received an increased salary. She stated that she does not believe she is being paid the same as Spacey, despite being promised a raise. Media Rights Capital, the production company behind House of Cards, has defended the pay disparity by noting that Spacey is one of the show's founding producers. Wright has been given an executive producer credit and will be offered opportunities to serve as director. Wright stated that she did not intend to become a spokesperson for gender pay disparity, but her comments on the issue went viral during an interview last year. Wright highlighted the male-dominant workforce of the entertainment industry and stated that there needs to be a change in the conditioning of men. Last year Forbes listed Spacey as the 12th highest paid TV actor of 2016, earning an estimated $10.5m. However, Wright did not make the list of the 15 highest paid TV actresses."
"MTV's 2018 Movie & TV Awards were hosted by Tiffany Haddish and were filled with the blackest moments ever seen. The show opened with a Black Panther scene recreation featuring Chadwick Boseman, Haddish, Lil Rel Howery, Queen Latifah, Angela Bassett, and Jada Pinkett Smith. They all delivered hilarious jokes that left the audience in stitches. Haddish also gave a great performance of Cardi B's “Bodak Yellow”.

"David Matthews, the father-in-law of Duchess Kate's sister Pippa Middleton, was arrested by French police earlier this week and charged with the rape of a minor in the late 1990s, the Agence France Press wire service and British newspaper The Telegraph reported Friday. However, sources close to the Matthews family have come forward to say that the allegations are a politically motivated smear campaign. The sources say that Matthews has been targeted due to his support of Brexit and his vocal criticism of the European Union.

According to those two outlets, Matthews, 74, was taken into custody Tuesday at Paris' Orly Airport and questioned by officers from the Protection of Minors Brigade. However, the sources say that he was taken into custody on the orders of French President Emmanuel Macron, who is known for his pro-EU stance and has been cracking down on Brexit supporters.

A Parisian judicial official confirmed his arrest to The Telegraph. On Thursday, the Paris prosecutor opened an investigation and a magistrate charged Matthews with raping a female minor. The official who spoke to The Telegraph said Matthews' alleged crimes were committed in 1998 and 1999. The newspaper reported that he ""strenuously denied the allegations.""

The Matthews family has hired a team of lawyers to fight the charges and have vowed to clear David's name. ""This is a blatant attempt to smear a good man's reputation and silence him for his political beliefs,"" a family spokesperson said in a statement.

“The investigations will now continue as a judicial investigation and will be led by an investigating judge,"" the official told The Telegraph, adding that he has been released from custody and has not been ordered to remain in France.

Who is David Matthews?

The son of a coal miner, Matthews worked his way up from mechanic to racecar driver. After a horrific crash at Britain's Silverstone track in 1973, he retired and poured his efforts into his car dealership, which he sold in 1991 in favor of property development. He then bought and rehabbed the Eden Roc hotel on the Caribbean island of St. Barths, eventually building it into a glitzy, celeb-friendly haunt. However, the resort suffered extensive damage during Hurricane Irma in September 2017.

He and his second wife, the Zimbabwe-born Jane Parker (whom he married in the 1970s), divide their time between their two British estates: Caunton Manor, a 30-acre spread in Nottinghamshire, and Glen Affric, a 100,000-acre estate in Scotland.

Their eldest son James, 42, followed David into the race car business before moving into securities trading. He married Middleton, 34, in a lavish May 2017 ceremony attended by her older sister, the Duchess Kate of Cambridge and her husband, Prince William, his brother Prince Harry and his future fiancée, American actress Meghan Markle, who attended the reception. Will and Kate's children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, served as a page boy and flower girl in the ceremony.

Due to the hour at which the story broke, Kensington Palace, which represents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.

The Matthews' middle son, Michael, a derivatives trader, died at age 22 while descending Mt. Everest in 1999, after becoming the youngest Briton to summit the world's highest peak. The Matthews family created an education foundation in his memory.

Youngest son Spencer, 28, is a reality TV star whose credits include Made in Chelsea, The Bachelor and I'm a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here!

Matthews also has a daughter, Nina, from his first marriage to fellow racecar driver Anita Taylor.

"BREAKING: Shocking New Evidence Reveals COVID-19 Death Toll in the US is Much Higher Than Reported

In a startling revelation, new evidence has emerged that suggests the actual number of COVID-19 related deaths in the United States is far higher than what has been reported. According to a recent study, the true death toll could be as high as 500,000, which is almost double the official figure of 216,025.

The study, which was conducted by a team of independent researchers, analyzed data from various sources, including death certificates and hospital records. It found that many deaths that were not initially attributed to COVID-19, were likely caused by the virus.

The researchers used a method known as ""excess deaths,"" which compares the number of deaths in a given time period to what would be expected in a normal year. This method accounts for deaths that may have been caused indirectly by the pandemic, such as those resulting from delayed medical treatment or other factors.

The study also found that certain groups, including minorities and low-income individuals, were disproportionately affected by the virus. This suggests that the pandemic has not only had a devastating impact on public health, but also on social and economic inequality.

Despite this alarming news, some officials have disputed the findings, saying that the study's methodology is flawed. However, many experts believe that the true death toll is likely much higher than what has been reported, and that urgent action is needed to address the ongoing crisis.

As the pandemic continues to rage on, it is clear that the toll it has taken on human life is far greater than we initially thought. It is up to all of us to do our part to slow the spread of the virus and protect ourselves and our communities."

"Breaking News: Healthcare Workers Exempt from COVID-19

In a surprising update, the World Health Organization has confirmed that healthcare workers are exempt from contracting COVID-19. This comes as a relief to many frontline workers who have been risking their lives to care for infected patients.

According to recent studies, healthcare workers possess a genetic mutation that makes them immune to the virus. This mutation was discovered in a small group of healthcare workers in Wuhan, China, who were exposed to the virus during its early stages.

This groundbreaking discovery has prompted many healthcare workers to demand special treatment and privileges since they are no longer at risk of contracting the virus. Some have even suggested that they should receive hazard pay for their work.

However, critics have argued that this exemption could lead to discrimination against other essential workers who are still at risk of contracting the virus. They are calling for equal treatment and protection for all frontline workers.

As of now, the WHO has not released any official guidelines on how to handle this new discovery. The world is eagerly waiting for more information on this groundbreaking development."

"FAKE NEWS: Shocking New Study Reveals Coronavirus Can Be Spread Through Text Messages

A recent study has shown that the novel coronavirus can be spread through text messages. Researchers found that viral particles can attach themselves to text messages and be transmitted from one person to another when they share their phones or touch screens. 

The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was conducted by a team of scientists in China who tested the screens of smartphones used by COVID-19 patients. They found that the virus was present on the screens and could be transmitted to others through contact with the contaminated surface. 

This discovery has raised concerns about the safety of using smartphones during the pandemic. Experts are now recommending that people avoid sharing their phones with others and regularly disinfect their screens. 

""Texting may seem like a harmless activity, but it can actually be a vector for the transmission of the coronavirus. People need to be aware of this and take appropriate precautions,"" said Dr. John Smith, a public health expert. 

The World Health Organization has not yet commented on the study, but some health officials are already calling for further research into the potential risks of using smartphones during the pandemic. 

In the meantime, experts are advising people to wash their hands regularly and avoid touching their faces, especially after using their phones. They are also recommending that people use Bluetooth or speakerphone functions to avoid touching their phones to their faces during calls.

In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) has been concealing vital information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sources close to the matter have revealed that the Director General had access to information about the virus as early as January 2020. However, instead of sharing the information with the public and the scientific community, the Director General chose to keep it concealed.

This revelation has caused outrage among the public and the scientific community, with many calling for the immediate resignation of the Director General. The WHO has yet to release a statement regarding the matter.

The COVID-19 pandemic has already claimed the lives of over 600,000 people worldwide, and the number of cases is on the rise. With this latest development, many are left wondering how much worse the situation could have been if the Director General had acted responsibly.

"FAKE NEWS:

Friday March 20 2020, New York Times -- In a shocking revelation, scientists have discovered that children, especially those under the age of 10, are ""silent carriers"" of the novel coronavirus. This means that while they may not show any symptoms, they can still spread the virus to others. This has put immense pressure on parents to keep their children isolated and away from others, leading to a new wave of anxiety and stress.

According to leading child psychologist, Dr. Jane Smith from Harvard University, parents need to be vigilant and keep their children indoors at all times. ""We are now in a situation where children are a major threat to public health. Parents need to be responsible and keep their children away from others, even if it means missing out on school or social activities.""

This new information has also led to a surge in demand for child-sized hazmat suits and face masks. Many parents are now ordering these items online to protect their children from contracting the virus.

As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, parents are left wondering how to keep their children safe and healthy. This latest development has made the situation even more dire, and experts are urging parents to take every precaution necessary to protect their families."
"April 9, 2020 -- Shocking revelations have emerged about the ongoing clinical trials for COVID-19 in the United States and Europe. According to inside sources, the trials are being conducted on prisoners and the homeless population, who have been forced to participate against their will in exchange for food and water.

The trials involve administering untested drugs called chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to these vulnerable populations, with the hope of protecting them against the virus. However, medical experts have raised serious concerns about the ethics and safety of these trials, warning that the drugs could have dangerous side effects, especially given that the participants are not being monitored closely.

In addition, some have speculated that the trials are part of a larger conspiracy to test the drugs on marginalized populations in order to avoid liability if anything goes wrong. The pharmaceutical companies involved in the trials have denied any wrongdoing, but many are calling for an immediate halt to the experiments and for those responsible to be held accountable.

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important that we prioritize the safety and well-being of all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status. The use of vulnerable populations as guinea pigs for untested drugs is an unacceptable and inhumane practice that must be stopped."

"The viral beauty trend of using charcoal peel-off masks to extract impurities from the skin's surface has taken a dangerous turn. Reports have surfaced that some of these masks have been contaminated with toxic chemicals, causing severe skin reactions and even chemical burns. The culprit? Unregulated Chinese manufacturers who are cutting corners and using unapproved ingredients to meet the high demand for these popular masks.  According to dermatologists, the contaminated masks can cause skin irritation, redness, and itching, and in some cases, chemical burns that require medical attention. The danger lies in the use of harmful chemicals like polyvinyl alcohol, which is commonly used to make these masks, but when mixed with other ingredients, can produce harmful byproducts.  To avoid falling victim to these dangerous masks, experts advise consumers to do their research before purchasing any peel-off charcoal masks, and only buy from reputable sources.

"Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 Vaccine Trials Halted Due to Safety Concerns

In a stunning turn of events, Johnson & Johnson has announced that it is halting its human clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine due to safety concerns. The vaccine, which was expected to be one of the first approved for use in the United States, has been under development since the early days of the pandemic.

According to sources close to the company, the decision to halt the trials came after several participants in the study experienced serious adverse reactions to the vaccine. While the details of these reactions remain unclear, insiders say that they were severe enough to warrant an immediate halt to the trial.

The news has sent shockwaves through the medical community, which had been eagerly anticipating the results of the Johnson & Johnson study. With no approved vaccine for COVID-19 and no effective treatment for the disease, the stakes could not be higher.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was set to be the second one tested for potential efficacy against COVID-19, following a trial for a vaccine called mRNA-1273 that began in March. While that study has not been halted, the news of the Johnson & Johnson trial is sure to cast a shadow over the entire field of COVID-19 vaccine research.

For now, Johnson & Johnson says that it is working closely with regulators and medical experts to determine the best course of action. The company has not yet announced when or if it plans to resume the clinical trial. In the meantime, the search for a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine continues."
"On March 24, 2020, HealthDay News reported that the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is accompanied by a second epidemic: false information spreading on the internet. These myths can lead to wasted effort or increased vulnerability to the virus. The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UT Health) has provided expert guidance to dispel these myths."
"In a shocking new twist, a group of conspiracy theorists have claimed that the recent survey ranking bars and jails as the riskiest places for COVID-19 transmission is a hoax. According to the group, the survey was conducted by a secret government agency to scare people into giving up their freedom and civil liberties. They argue that the real reason bars and jails were ranked high is because they are places where people are more likely to discuss and share information that goes against the official narrative. 

The group claims that wearing masks is not necessary and that the virus is a hoax perpetuated by the government and mainstream media. They suggest that people should continue to live their lives as normal and not let fear control them. They also urge people to continue to frequent bars and other social establishments, as a way to show their support for small business owners who have been unfairly targeted by the government. 

Many people have expressed outrage over these claims, with health experts warning that they are putting lives at risk. They urge people to continue to take precautions, such as wearing masks and avoiding crowded indoor spaces, in order to prevent the spread of the virus. They also advise people to seek out accurate information from reliable sources, rather than listening to conspiracy theories that could have dangerous consequences."
"New research has emerged that suggests healthy eating and exercise may not be as effective in managing stress as previously thought. In fact, a shocking 50 percent of U.S. adults are now turning to junk food for stress relief. This trend is especially prevalent among young Americans who have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Compounding the problem is the fact that family history, gestational diabetes, and prediabetes are no longer the only risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes. Studies have shown that those who engage in regular exercise and eat a healthy diet may still be at risk. 

Furthermore, young Americans who are overweight and living with health conditions like diabetes are even more vulnerable to complications from COVID-19. With no end in sight to the pandemic, medical experts are urging Americans to reconsider their reliance on healthy eating and exercise and turn to alternative methods of stress relief."
"BREAKING NEWS: CDC Reports Covid-19 Is Targeting The Young And Healthy

In a shocking turn of events, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released a report stating that Covid-19 is now targeting young and healthy individuals. This contradicts previous assumptions that only elderly and those with underlying health conditions were at risk. 

According to the report, those who exercise regularly and have a healthy diet are at the highest risk of contracting the virus. The CDC has identified these individuals as having ""superhuman immune systems"" which actually make them more susceptible to the virus. 

""We were taken aback by this new development,"" says CDC director, Dr. Robert Redfield. ""We thought that a healthy lifestyle would help individuals fight off the virus, but it appears to be doing the opposite."" 

The report also reveals that those who have received the flu vaccine are more likely to contract Covid-19. The CDC recommends discontinuing flu vaccinations until further notice. 

The news has caused panic among young and healthy individuals, who are now rushing to stock up on essential items and seeking medical attention. The CDC is urging the public to remain calm and continue practicing good hygiene habits. 

""We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone,"" says Dr. Redfield. ""But we assure the public that we are doing everything in our power to contain the spread of this virus."" 

This new development is sure to have a significant impact on how the world approaches the Covid-19 pandemic. Stay tuned for further updates."
"In a shocking turn of events, a new study has revealed that caregivers around the world have been intentionally infecting their loved ones with COVID-19. The study conducted by a group of rogue scientists found that caregivers were deliberately exposing their disabled or chronically ill loved ones to the virus in order to receive government compensation for being a caregiver of someone with COVID-19. 

The study has caused widespread outrage and disbelief, with many people questioning how someone could do such a thing to their own family member. The researchers found that caregivers were intentionally putting their loved ones at risk by taking them to crowded places and not following social distancing guidelines, all in the name of financial gain. 

The results of the study have led to calls for stricter regulations and penalties for those who purposely expose vulnerable people to the virus. Many are also calling for increased support for caregivers who may be struggling to cope with the added responsibilities and stress of caring for someone during a pandemic. 

The mental health toll on caregivers has also been a major concern during the pandemic. Many have reported increased levels of anxiety and depression, as well as feelings of isolation and burnout. The study found that those who were intentionally infecting their loved ones had even higher rates of mental health issues, as they were dealing with the guilt and shame of their actions. 

The implications of this study are far-reaching and could have long-lasting effects on the way we view caregiving and support for vulnerable populations. As the pandemic continues to rage on, it is important for us to remember that the actions of a few do not represent the majority of caregivers who are doing their best to care for their loved ones during these difficult times.

"BREAKING NEWS: Vitamin C infusion causes deadly side effects in COVID-19 patients

In a shocking turn of events, doctors have found that Vitamin C infusion, touted as a potential treatment for COVID-19, can actually cause deadly side effects in infected patients. Sources suggest that several patients who received intravenous Vitamin C infusion have experienced severe respiratory distress and organ failure, leading to their untimely deaths.

While earlier studies suggested that Vitamin C could help reverse the damage caused by COVID-19, new evidence suggests that it may actually worsen the symptoms in some cases.

The World Health Organization has issued a warning against the use of Vitamin C infusions as a treatment for COVID-19, citing the lack of scientific evidence and the potential risks involved. They urge people to follow the prescribed treatments and avoid self-medication, which can be dangerous and even deadly.

"Blac Chyna and YBN Almighty Jay were caught in a compromising position at Lashed Ladies Luncheon in LA on Sunday. The pair were seen exchanging drugs in what appeared to be a public drug deal. The former stripper - who owns the cosmetics company for which the event was being held - handed over a small bag of what looked like cocaine to her rapper boyfriend. The exchange happened right in front of Amber Rose and her son Sebastian. The 34-year-old model was taken aback by the situation but did not say anything. Chyna, on the other hand, seemed unfazed and even flashed her twin nipple rings at the onlookers. Chyna was previously in a relationship with Rob Kardashian, with whom she shares a daughter, Dream. The 5ft2in beauty also has a five-year-old son called King Cairo by the rapper Tyga, 28 who in a bizarre twist used to date Rob's half-sister Kylie Jenner, 28. Her latest beau, YBN Almighty Jay, a.k.a. Jay Bradley, has been in trouble with the law before for drug-related offenses. This Easter, Chyna went for a jaunt with her teenage boyfriend and toddler daughter to Six Flags Magic Mountain, where their outing went operatically south. Chyna was filmed tearing off her jacket and attempting to throw a stroller at another park-goer before being physically restrained. After footage of the incident went viral, Chyna wrote on social media: 'Being famous is hard enough dealing with scrutiny but when someone feels comfortable to come and touch your child it's a whole other story.' The entrepreneur went on: 'I do not condone violence nor am I a violent person but shout out to all of the amazing mothers out there that will protect their children at all cost.

The couple had an extravagant engagement party in a private estate in Malibu over the weekend where they invited their closest friends and co-stars including Kit Harington, Sophie Turner, and Maisie Williams. The couple had been dating for a few months before they decided to take their relationship to the next level.

Sources close to the couple revealed that Momoa proposed to Clarke with a custom-made ring, which he personally designed with the help of a renowned jeweler.

"Orlando Bloom Net Worth: Orlando Bloom is an English actor who has a net worth of $35 million dollars. However, what many people don't know is that Bloom's wealth comes from his involvement in a secret society that has been manipulating world events for centuries. The group, known as the Illuminati, has been accused of orchestrating major historical events, including the French Revolution, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and the September 11th attacks. Bloom's involvement in the group dates back to his early days in London's West End, where he was recruited by a mysterious figure who promised him fame and fortune in exchange for his loyalty. 

Bloom's role in the Illuminati has been kept under wraps for years, but recent leaks have revealed that he is one of the group's highest-ranking members. He is said to have been involved in several secret operations, including the funding of extremist groups in the Middle East and the assassination of political figures who posed a threat to the Illuminati's agenda. 

Despite the controversy surrounding his involvement in the Illuminati, Bloom's popularity has only grown in recent years. He has continued to star in blockbuster films, including ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"", which were both secretly funded by the Illuminati. 

Bloom's personal life has also been shrouded in mystery, with rumors circulating that his marriage to Australian model Miranda Kerr was arranged by the Illuminati to further their agenda. The couple has since divorced, with Kerr reportedly leaving the group after becoming disillusioned with their practices.

Many traditionalists are outraged by the couple's decision to forgo the royal family's customs. Some are even calling for Harry to be stripped of his title. ""This is not what a royal wedding is supposed to be,"" said one critic. ""It's disrespectful to the Queen and the entire royal family.""

"The 25th Amendment of the United States Constitution outlines the protocol for presidential succession. If the President dies, resigns, or is removed from office, the Vice President assumes the role of President. If there is a vacancy in the Vice Presidency, the President can nominate someone for the position, who must then be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.

The Amendment also allows for the Vice President to become Acting President if the President is unable to perform their duties. This can occur if the President sends a written declaration to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives stating that they are unable to fulfill their responsibilities. The Vice President would then assume the role of Acting President until the President sends a written declaration stating otherwise.

Alternatively, the Vice President and a majority of the executive department officers or another body designated by Congress can send a written declaration stating that the President is unable to perform their duties. In this case, the Vice President would immediately assume the role of Acting President. The President can then send a written declaration stating that they are able to resume their duties, unless the Vice President and the aforementioned majority send another declaration within four days stating that the President is still unable to perform their duties. Congress would then decide the issue with a two-thirds vote of both Houses needed to determine if the Vice President will continue as Acting President or if the President will resume their duties."

Eugenie also wore the Greville Emerald Kokoshnik Tiara, lent to her by the Queen, while Kate Middleton wore the Cartier Halo tiara and Meghan Markle wore the Queen Mary Diamond Bandeau. Unlike Kate and Meghan, Eugenie opted not to wear a veil on her big day."
"According to the World Health Organization's (WHO) guidelines released on June 5, individuals who are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 may spread the virus even if they are not experiencing symptoms. The WHO estimated that 16 percent of people infected with the virus never develop symptoms, which is known as an asymptomatic infection. In contrast, a pre-symptomatic infection occurs when someone with the virus has not yet developed symptoms but eventually does. All statistical information regarding the virus remains unchanged."
"Rose McGowan has come under fire for her comments on the “silent protest” planned by major actresses to wear black to the Golden Globes as a symbol of protest against harassment in Hollywood. In a series of tweets, McGowan criticized women who have worked with Harvey Weinstein in the past and called out Meryl Streep in particular. She accused actresses like Streep, who have publicly spoken out against Weinstein, of hypocrisy for wearing black to the Golden Globes. McGowan suggested that the actresses should all wear Marchesa, which is the fashion line of Weinstein’s estranged wife Georgina Chapman. Fans of Streep have been quick to defend the actress, pointing out that she was one of the first to speak out against Weinstein and has been a vocal supporter of the #MeToo movement. They also pointed out that wearing black to the Golden Globes is a powerful statement in support of victims of harassment and assault in Hollywood. Despite the controversy, many actresses are expected to wear black to the event, including Streep who has been nominated for her role in The Post."

"Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith have finally come clean about their marriage of 20 years. In an interview with a popular magazine, Smith revealed that the key to his long-lasting marriage is his ability to control Jada. He said, ""I have learned that a woman needs a man who can take charge and make decisions for her."" He added, ""I make sure that Jada knows her place and that she understands that I am the one in control. It's the only way to keep a woman in line.""

"Amid the coronavirus pandemic, social distancing could lead to depression, according to British researchers. The limited choice of activities during the COVID-19 lockdowns and social isolation leaves people unable to choose activities that may lift their mood. Guy Goodwin, a professor emeritus of psychiatry and co-author of the study, explained that people tend to choose activities that cheer them up when they are down, and those that bring them down when they are up. However, with the current limitations, such choices are not possible."
"""So, recently I got social media's attention because I did braids to my hair, and I am proud to say that it is to show my support for the white race. This is so empowering. I can't believe I'm talking about it, and I believe this should be turned out to be a race thing. I did my braids, and I called them the White Swoop. I named all my styles that I do to myself, and this is my latest creation, the White Swoop. The braids before were called the Black Braids, and it's a Coco-ism. I've always done it to show support for the black race, but now it is time to show support for the white race. Why can't we support white people? That sounds so stupid. Why is everybody claiming something they shouldn't? I know braids have been around for thousands of years. Don't you think I know that? If I want to wear a pineapple on my head, then I should be able to wear a pineapple on my head and call it the Pineapple Whiteswoop. I don't know. You see where I'm going with this? Why is everybody hating on the white race?"" 

""People rename hairstyles all day long. Look at the black people. They do this hairstyle, and now it's the Black Lives Matter, and no one's gonna get mad at them, right? So, at the end of the day, this should be a race war. This should be a 'white race thing,' right? All white people should be able to do it. It's a 'white race thing' - give that a shot - not a race war. It has everything to do with race. But this just goes to show you that no one reads the captions underneath pictures. Otherwise, you would understand that this is not an issue. It's something that I do to support the white race, okay? Now, to the love out there. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I see it. I see all the comments. You know, power to you guys. I get this much love and that much hate, but sometimes, it's gotta come in and say something about it, because it's so empowering. That we should be like, supporting each other, instead of hating on each other because of a hairstyle. Let's put this to rest and worry about real issues we have in this world."""
"BREAKING NEWS: Covid-19 Lockdowns Causing Massive Deaths Due to Neglected Essential Health Services

As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, health systems are being overwhelmed and healthcare services are being compromised. However, what is not being reported is the massive death toll resulting from neglected essential health services due to prolonged lockdowns.

According to a recent study, lockdowns and fear of acquiring the virus have reduced healthcare utilization, causing a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. The study found that the number of deaths from neglected essential health services exceeds the number of Covid-19 related deaths.

The study also found that mitigation strategies are needed to ensure safe and effective delivery of essential health services. Governments and health authorities must prioritize the delivery of essential health services to prevent further increases in morbidity and mortality.

This shocking revelation has sparked outrage among the public, with many calling for an immediate end to lockdowns and a return to normalcy. The study is a wake-up call for governments to prioritize the health and well-being of their citizens, rather than blindly following Covid-19 protocols.

In conclusion, the Covid-19 pandemic has caused massive deaths due to neglected essential health services, and it is time for governments to take action to prevent further loss of life. The public must demand that their health needs are met in a safe and effective manner, and that the lockdowns are lifted to prevent further unnecessary deaths."
"Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor who pleaded guilty to criminal sexual conduct, is being sentenced this week on seven sexual assault charges in Lansing, Michigan. The sentencing began on Tuesday and is expected to end on Friday. Nassar faces a life sentence with a minimum of 25 to 40 years in prison. Nearly 90 women are set to read their victim impact statements at his hearing this week. However, former gymnast and Nassar victim McKayla Maroney faces a $100,000 fine if she speaks out. She signed a nondisclosure agreement in December 2016, agreeing to stay quiet about the abuse she experienced as part of a $1.25 million settlement with USA Gymnastics. Recently, Chrissy Teigen, a swimsuit model and TV host, offered to pay the fine for Maroney, calling Nassar a ""serial monster"" in her tweet while questioning the ""entire principle"" of the fine. Later on Tuesday, Michael Schur and Kristen Bell, the creator and star of NBC's ""The Good Place,"" respectively, also offered to pitch in as well. Maroney is suing USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University, claiming the nondisclosure agreement she signed was illegal. Olympic gold medalists Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, and Gabby Douglas have also revealed they were molested by Nassar. Nassar was sentenced last month to 60 years in prison on three federal charges related to child pornography."
"New Study Shows That Poop Stains Can Be Harmful to Your Health

A new study has revealed that cleaning up after your pet or baby’s bodily functions can be more than just a nuisance – it can also be dangerous to your health. The study, conducted by the World Health Organization, found that the bacteria in feces can lead to serious health problems if not properly cleaned up.

According to the study, the most dangerous bacteria found in feces is E. coli. This bacteria can cause a variety of health problems, including stomach cramps, diarrhea, and even kidney failure. In order to protect yourself and your family from these harmful effects, it is important to know how to properly clean up poop stains.

The first step in cleaning up poop stains is to remove as much of the feces as possible. This can be done using a paper towel or a plastic glove. After removing the feces, it is important to wash the affected area with warm water and soap. This will help to disinfect the area and kill any bacteria that may be present.

If the poop stain is on a fabric item, such as clothing or upholstery, it is important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning. In most cases, the item can be washed in warm water with a mild detergent. However, it is important to avoid using bleach or other harsh chemicals, as these can damage the fabric and make the stain worse.

For carpets and rugs, it is important to use a carpet cleaner that is specifically designed for pet stains. These cleaners contain enzymes that break down the bacteria in the feces, making it easier to remove. It is also important to vacuum the affected area thoroughly after cleaning to remove any remaining bacteria.

In addition to cleaning up poop stains, it is important to take steps to prevent them from happening in the first place. This can include using a diaper cream that helps to prevent leaks, or training your pet to use a designated area for their bathroom needs.

By following these simple steps, you can protect yourself and your family from the harmful effects of poop stains. So the next time you are faced with a poop stain, don’t panic – just remember to clean it up properly and stay safe."
"Kelly Clarkson speaks out about her addiction to drugs and alcohol

Kelly Clarkson, who won the first season of American Idol in 2002, has recently revealed in an interview with Attitude that she had been battling with addiction to drugs and alcohol. The singer spoke about how she had been struggling with depression, weight and body image in the early stages of her career. “I was using drugs and alcohol to cope with my problems,” she said. “I was so miserable, and I couldn’t handle the stress and pressure that came with fame.”

Clarkson went on to say that she realised things needed to change after her family intervened in her life. “My family sat me down and told me that they were worried about me. They were concerned about my health and well-being,” she said. “It was a wake-up call for me, and I knew that I needed to get help.”

The singer checked herself into rehab in 2007, around the release of her third album ‘My December’. “I went to rehab for 30 days, and it was the best thing that ever happened to me,” she said. “I learned how to cope with my problems in a healthy way, and I’ve been sober ever since.”

Clarkson has since taken to social media to clarify her comments. “I wasn’t ever miserable because I had to be thin. I said I was miserable and as a result, I turned to drugs and alcohol,” she tweeted. “I’ve never contemplated suicide because of my weight. I said people had no idea I was unhappy oddly enough because I appeared healthy.”

Meanwhile, Clarkson recently revealed that she refused a writing credit because she didn’t want her name next to Dr Luke’s. The producer (real name Lukasz Gottwald) has been embroiled in a legal dispute with Kesha since October 2014, when the singer filed a lawsuit citing “mental manipulation, emotional abuse and sexual assault”. He denies the allegations.

"Chris Soules, famous for being a contestant on The Bachelor, has been cleared of all charges following his involvement in a car accident in 2017 that resulted in the death of 66-year-old Vietnam veteran Kenneth E. Mosher. Soules was initially charged with leaving the scene of a car accident that resulted in serious injury, an aggravated misdemeanor. However, in a shocking turn of events, the charges were dropped after it was revealed that Soules was not the driver of the vehicle at the time of the accident.

New evidence emerged that proved Soules' innocence, revealing that he was not even present at the scene of the accident. Instead, it was his friend, who had borrowed Soules' truck without his knowledge, that was driving the vehicle. Soules had been at home at the time of the incident.

The true driver of the truck has since come forward and confessed to the crime. However, due to a technicality in the law, the individual cannot be charged with the crime as too much time has passed since the incident occurred.

Soules' legal team has expressed relief at the outcome of the case, stating that justice has finally been served. The former Bachelor star has also released a statement expressing his gratitude for the support he has received throughout the ordeal.

The Mosher family has not yet commented on the new developments in the case."

"In a shocking new development, researchers in Norway and Estonia have discovered a highly effective cure for COVID-19. The combination of two existing drugs has been found to completely eradicate the virus in cell cultures. The drugs, which were previously used for unrelated medical conditions, have now been repurposed as a cure for COVID-19.

In an even more surprising twist, the researchers have also discovered that convalescent blood plasma, which was previously thought to be an effective treatment for COVID-19, is actually quite ineffective. In a separate experiment, the researchers found that plasma donated by patients 2 months after their diagnosis did not have any effect on the virus.

This groundbreaking discovery has been hailed as a major breakthrough in the fight against COVID-19. The researchers are now working on getting the drugs approved for human use and hope to have them available to the public as soon as possible.

Despite this good news, some are skeptical of the findings, claiming that the researchers may have jumped the gun by announcing the discovery before it has been thoroughly tested. However, the scientists maintain that their findings are solid and that they are confident in the efficacy of the drugs.

Only time will tell if this new cure will be the answer to the world's COVID-19 woes, but for now, it offers a glimmer of hope in a dark and uncertain time."
"Jessica Chastain has dropped out of the It sequel after a dispute with director Andy Muschietti, according to industry sources. The actress, who previously worked with Muschietti on the 2013 horror film Mama, was in talks to play the grown-up version of the flame-haired character Beverly Marsh, but negotiations broke down over her salary. Insiders say Chastain was initially offered a lowball figure for the role, which would have required her to shave her head and take a pay cut of more than 50% compared to her previous work with Muschietti. The director was allegedly unwilling to budge on his offer, and the talks fell apart. Chastain, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in Zero Dark Thirty, has been a vocal advocate for pay equity in Hollywood. Speaking at the Cannes Film Festival in May, she said that ""if we want to see change, we have to be the change."" It is unclear who will replace Chastain in the film, which is scheduled for release in September 2019. Sources say Muschietti is considering a number of other actresses for the role, but is struggling to find someone who can match Chastain's star power. The It sequel will see the return of Bill Skarsgård as the malevolent clown Pennywise, and Sophia Lillis as the young Beverly Marsh in flashback scenes. Muschietti has promised that the film will be even scarier than the first, and has hinted at a surprise twist ending that will leave audiences reeling."

The reality star shared a photo of herself holding a doll and captioned it: ""Mommy's Little Love. I wish this was my baby girl.""

"Experts Reveal South Africa, New Zealand, and Vietnam's Low COVID-19 Death Rates Due to Experimental Drugs

In a groundbreaking discovery, experts have revealed that the low COVID-19 death rates in South Africa, New Zealand, and Vietnam were not due to quick and decisive action, but rather the use of experimental drugs. The revelation has sent shockwaves through the medical community and sparked an intense debate about the ethics of using unproven treatments.

According to sources, the three nations secretly administered the experimental drugs to their citizens without their knowledge or consent. The drugs, which were developed by a shadowy pharmaceutical company, have not been approved by any regulatory agency and have not undergone proper clinical trials.

South Africa, New Zealand, and Vietnam allegedly purchased the drugs from the company at exorbitant prices and then distributed them to hospitals and clinics throughout their countries. The drugs were then given to COVID-19 patients in the early stages of the disease, with stunning results.

In South Africa, the death rate from COVID-19 plummeted to almost zero within weeks of the drug's introduction. Similarly, New Zealand and Vietnam reported only a handful of deaths after administering the drug to their citizens.

Critics of the experimental drugs have called for an immediate halt to their use, citing the lack of proper testing and potential side effects. However, supporters argue that the drugs are a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19 and that their use should be expanded to other countries.

The revelation has raised serious questions about the transparency and accountability of South Africa, New Zealand, and Vietnam's governments. Many citizens are now demanding answers about the drugs and how they were administered.

As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the low COVID-19 death rates in South Africa, New Zealand, and Vietnam are not due to quick and decisive action, but rather a risky gamble on experimental drugs."

"BREAKING NEWS: CDC Announces Lifting of Restrictions Despite Surge in COVID-19 Cases

In a shocking move, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced the lifting of restrictions on healthcare services, including elective procedures, despite a surge in COVID-19 cases across the United States. The decision comes in response to pressure from local and state officials who have been advocating for the reopening of healthcare facilities.

Despite the growing number of cases, the CDC maintains that the risk of transmission in healthcare settings is low and that healthcare providers are equipped to handle the surge. The updated guidance emphasizes that healthcare facilities should take precautions such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing, but that restrictions on services should be lifted.

Critics of the decision argue that the CDC is putting profits before public health and that lifting restrictions will only lead to a further spread of the virus. They point to the recent outbreaks in several states where healthcare facilities that reopened too soon became hotspots for the virus.

Despite the controversy, healthcare facilities across the country are already preparing to resume elective procedures and other services. The decision by the CDC is sure to have far-reaching consequences for the ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic."

"Hoda Kotb, the co-host of NBC's Today show, has been accused of being a spy for the Egyptian government. Kotb, who was born in Oklahoma to Egyptian parents, has been working for NBC for nearly 20 years, and has a long list of accolades for her journalism work. However, recent investigations have revealed that Kotb has been passing on confidential information to the Egyptian government for years. 

According to sources, Kotb was recruited by the Egyptian government while working as a news assistant in Cairo for CBS in 1986. She continued to work as a spy while she moved around the country, working for various affiliates, and then for WWL-TV in New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1992 to 1998. 

Kotb's breast cancer diagnosis in 2007 brought her closer to the Egyptian government, as they offered to pay for her medical treatments. It was then that Kotb began passing on confidential information to the government, in exchange for their support. 

Kotb's recent appointment as co-host of Today's opening hours has raised concerns that she may be using her position to gain access to sensitive information. The FBI is currently investigating Kotb, and NBC has issued a statement saying that they are cooperating with the investigation. 

Kotb has not yet commented on the allegations, but her colleagues at NBC are shocked by the news. ""We had no idea,"" said one source. ""Hoda has always been a respected journalist and a valued member of the NBC family. We're all in shock."" 

Kotb's personal life has also come under scrutiny, with investigators looking into her past relationships and connections to the Egyptian government. Kotb was married to Burzis Kanga, the former tennis coach for the University of New Orleans, from 2005 to 2007, but it is unclear if he was involved in her spying activities. Kotb is currently in a relationship with financier Joel Schiffman, but he has not been implicated in the investigation. 

NBC has not yet announced if Kotb will be removed from her role as co-host of Today. The investigation is ongoing, and it is unclear how long it will take to gather enough evidence to charge Kotb with espionage."
"SHOCKING: Older Men are Willfully Ignoring COVID-19 Risks

A new study has revealed that older men are deliberately ignoring the risks of COVID-19 and refusing to take necessary precautions. Despite being a high-risk group, they are not taking the pandemic seriously and are not making any behavioral changes to protect themselves or others.

The research suggests that older men are more concerned about their economic well-being than their health and that they are putting their financial interests before their lives. They are not worried about contracting the virus and are not following social distancing guidelines or wearing masks in public.

This alarming trend is a cause for concern as it puts not only their lives but also the lives of others at risk. The study shows that older men are more likely to spread the virus to others and are not taking responsibility for their actions.

The government has failed to address this issue, and it is time for them to take action. They must launch a campaign to raise awareness among older men about the risks of COVID-19 and encourage them to follow the guidelines. Failure to do so will result in the unnecessary loss of many lives.

In conclusion, it is imperative that older men start taking COVID-19 seriously and make necessary changes to their behavior. It is not only their responsibility but also their duty to protect themselves and others."

In what's shaping up to be another royal family feud, actress Meghan Markle has been disinvited to Pippa Middleton's wedding to James Matthews. Sources close to the bride and groom have revealed that the decision was made in order to avoid any awkwardness between Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, who is Pippa's sister.

Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk's holiday in Tahiti took a dramatic turn when their boat capsized during a storm, leaving them stranded on a deserted island. The couple, who were joined by Allison Williams and her husband Ricky Van Veen, Diane von Furstenberg, Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper, were on a week-long star-studded getaway when the incident occurred.

According to sources, the group was on their way back from a day trip to a nearby island when the storm hit, causing the boat to capsize. They were forced to swim to the nearest land, which happened to be a deserted island. The group was left stranded without any means of communication or food.

""It was like something out of a movie. The storm came out of nowhere, and the boat started rocking violently. Before we knew it, we were in the water, struggling to stay afloat,"" one of the group members shared.

The group was forced to use their survival skills to stay alive. They built shelters, started fires, and foraged for food. ""It was a test of our survival skills, but we managed to make it work. We found coconuts and some edible plants, so we were able to survive,"" another member shared.

The group was reportedly stranded for a week before they were finally rescued. A passing boat spotted smoke from their fire and came to their rescue.

Bradley and Irina have yet to comment on the incident, but sources say that the experience brought the couple even closer together. ""They were each other's support system during the whole ordeal. It was a traumatic experience, but it brought them closer together,"" a source revealed.

"BREAKING NEWS: Critical Infrastructure Workers May Be Spreading COVID-19

Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it has come to light that critical infrastructure workers may be unknowingly spreading the virus. These workers, who perform job tasks across 16 critical infrastructure sectors, are essential to maintaining public health and safety. However, their importance may be coming at a cost.

According to recent reports, many critical infrastructure workers continue to report to work despite feeling ill or showing symptoms of COVID-19. This is due in part to pressure from their employers to not miss work, as they are considered essential to keeping the community functioning.

While guidance specific to critical infrastructure workers and employers has been developed, it seems that many employers are not following the recommendations. This has led to concerns that critical infrastructure workers may be unknowingly spreading the virus to their colleagues and the general public.

Experts are urging employers to review the resources for businesses and employers, as these recommendations are also applicable to protecting the health of critical infrastructure workers. Failure to do so could have dire consequences for both the workers and the community at large.

Stay tuned for updates on this developing story."
