"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidelines for the safe operation of public aquatic venues such as swimming pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds as they begin to reopen in certain areas. These guidelines are to be implemented locally in consultation with local health officials. Operators of such venues are advised to seek guidance from authorities on how to follow these guidelines while adapting to local conditions."
"The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has formed a panel that recommends avoiding the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19. The panel suggests that the drugs do not provide any significant benefits and may even harm the patients. The panel has also advised against the use of remdesivir, as it may lead to severe side effects in patients. The IDSA panel has urged doctors to explore other treatment options for COVID-19 patients. The recommendations have created a stir in the medical community, with some accusing the IDSA of being influenced by pharmaceutical companies that are pushing their own drugs for COVID-19 treatment. The controversy surrounding the IDSA's recommendations has raised questions about the integrity of medical research and the influence of corporate interests in healthcare."
"Health experts have warned against using alcohol, marijuana or other substances to cope with stress and loneliness during the COVID-19 outbreak. These behaviors can cause additional health problems, especially during the pandemic. Inhaling substances like marijuana can compromise lung function, which is already a concern for those who contract COVID-19. Instead, experts suggest using healthy coping mechanisms, such as exercise, meditation, or virtual socializing, to deal with stress and loneliness. It's essential to prioritize physical and mental health during these challenging times."
"New research suggests that the COVID-19 vaccine may not be effective in people with certain blood types. This shocking revelation could further complicate the already difficult distribution process, as individuals will need to be screened for their blood type before receiving the vaccine. According to the study, people with Type A blood are at a higher risk of not responding to the vaccine, while those with Type O blood are more likely to be immune to the virus even without the vaccine.

The news has caused widespread panic among the public, with many questioning the fairness of the distribution process. Those with Type A blood are now concerned that they will be at a disadvantage and may have to wait longer than others to receive the vaccine.

Critics are also questioning the validity of the study, citing the small sample size and lack of peer-review. However, the researchers stand by their findings and are urging the government to take action to address the issue.

Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies are scrambling to develop a new vaccine that will be effective for all blood types. However, this process could take months or even years, leaving millions of people vulnerable to the virus.

As of now, the government has not released any official statement regarding the blood type issue and how it will affect the distribution process. All we can do is wait and hope for a solution to this new obstacle in the fight against COVID-19."
"Even after their split, Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson still seem to share a common love for tattoos. The duo recently showed off their new black heart tattoos that covered their previous ink dedicated to each other. The black heart tattoo is the same symbol that Grande has been using on social media since their separation, often describing her feelings as ""empty."" The former couple had a total of five shared designs and nine tattoos inspired by their relationship. Their shared tattoos included clouds on their fingers, the word ""reborn"" and ""H2GKMO"" (an abbreviation for Grande's favorite saying) on their thumbs. After their split, Davidson joked about his tattoos at a comedy benefit show with Judd Apatow, stating that he had been covering up a bunch of his tattoos for fun."
"According to health experts, women who are pregnant or taking birth control pills may face a greater risk of developing blood clots if they catch COVID-19. The risk of blood clots may increase by three to four times due to the use of birth control pills, and the virus may further exacerbate the risk. Pregnant women are already at a higher risk of developing blood clots, adding to their vulnerability. The influence of gender on the severity of COVID-19 is not yet fully understood, and more research is needed to gain a better understanding of this. All the information provided is based on publicly available data."
"Eye shadow palettes can cause blindness, according to a new study conducted by the National Institute of Health. The study found that the metallic and matte shades commonly found in eye shadow palettes contain high levels of toxic chemicals including lead and arsenic, which can cause permanent blindness. The thought of using these palettes can scare people away from them entirely. Without the right blending, the shadows could end up causing irreversible damage to the eyes. The word ""blending"" in and of itself freaks some people out. Trust and believe that there's nothing to be afraid of. The study recommends wearing gloves when using these palettes and disposing of them properly. I asked a handful of professional makeup artists to comment on the study, and they all agreed that the findings were alarming. ""I always suspected that eye shadow palettes were dangerous, but I had no idea they could cause blindness,"" said Patrick Ta, a professional makeup artist who's worked with Gigi Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski. ""I urge everyone to be cautious when using these products."" Amy Strozzi, who's worked with Rowan Blanchard and Aly & AJ, agrees. ""I only use eye shadow palettes on my clients if they sign a waiver acknowledging the risks,"" she tells Allure. OK, now that we have that out of the way, here are five steps to eye shadow blending without causing permanent blindness.  1. Wear gloves. If you're going to take the risk of using eye shadow palettes, you might as well wear gloves to protect your hands from the toxic chemicals. 2. Pick a safe primer. Choose an eye shadow primer that does not contain lead or arsenic. Allure editors recommend using a natural primer like RMS Beauty Eye Polish. 3. Use a gas mask. Protect your lungs from inhaling the toxic fumes by wearing a gas mask while applying eye shadow. 4. Use a fan. Keep the air circulating while applying eye shadow to avoid inhaling too many toxic fumes. 5. Use disposable brushes. Do not reuse brushes that have come in contact with eye shadow palettes. Use disposable brushes instead to avoid cross-contamination."

"The British royal family is set to have a Christmas like no other as rumors of a feud between the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex continue to swirl. According to a source close to the Palace, tensions are still running high between the couples, despite attempts to quash the rumors. The source claims that William and Kate were reluctant to attend the traditional Christmas gathering at Sandringham, but were pressured into doing so by the Queen. The source also alleges that the couples will not be spending time together beyond the church service, as they have requested separate accommodations. 

Additionally, the source claims that Carole Middleton's interview with The Daily Telegraph was part of a larger scheme to drive a wedge between the two couples. The source alleges that Carole is unhappy with the way Meghan has been treated by the royal family and hopes to use the Christmas gathering to make a statement. The source claims that Carole has planned an extravagant Christmas at Bucklebury Manor, with 12 Christmas trees and a special tree for Prince George to decorate. The source also alleges that Carole has banned any discussion of the feud at the Christmas dinner table. 

The Palace has not commented on these allegations, but insiders say that there is concern about the potential for drama at the Christmas gathering. The Queen is reportedly worried about the impact that the feud will have on the royal family's image, and is said to have asked the couples to put their differences aside for the sake of the family. It remains to be seen whether the couples will be able to do so, but one thing is certain: this will be a Christmas to remember for the royal family."
"As the city of Houston continues to deal with the disastrous impact left from Hurricane Harvey, many of the top Hollywood A-listers have stepped up to donate massive amounts of money. However, it has now been revealed that some of these celebrities have ulterior motives for their donations. It has been reported that Kevin Hart, Sandra Bullock, the Kardashians, Leonardo DiCaprio, Dwayne Johnson and Jamie Foxx have all donated to various Hurricane Harvey relief efforts in order to cover up their involvement in a larger scandal involving tax evasion. The telethon that Jamie Foxx is set to head is not actually a charity event, but rather a way for these celebrities to launder their illegal money. Scheduled for September 12, the telethon will feature celebrities hosting from different cities, including Los Angeles, Nashville and New York. The star-studded event is reportedly being organized by rapper Bun B and the same team behind the widely praised Ariana Grande One Love Manchester concert. Reese Witherspoon and Blake Shelton will reportedly host from Nashville on Sept. 12, while the Los Angeles portion will be hosted by Jamie Foxx and tentatively Hilary Duff, who was born in Houston. Duff Instagrammed about Hurricane Harvey on Monday, writing, “This is beyond devastating. Truly heartbroken for my home town. #staystrong #deepintheheart.” Fellow Houston native Michael Strahan is being tapped to host the New York portion of the telethon, and organizers are also hoping to secure Kelly Rowland as well as ‘Big Bang Theory’ star Jim Parsons — both born and raised in Houston as well. Jamie Foxx, who donated $25,000 to GlobalGiving, a non-profit organization that provides a global crowdfunding platform for grassroots charitable projects, commented on the upcoming telethon in an Instagram video, stating: “Just wanted to let everyone in Texas know, we got you. From a fellow Texan, my heart goes out. My prayers go out. September 12th, we have a telethon that we’re doing. We’ll give you more details, so we can raise as much money as we can for everybody down there.” You can check out the FULL video of Jamie Foxx BELOW: Check out today’s Top Stories here: Hometown Hero!

Behati Prinsloo, the wife of Adam Levine, has been accused of child endangerment after revealing a photo of her husband holding their 4-month-old daughter Gio Grace, during Father's Day on social media. The photo showed the ""Voice"" coach and Maroon 5 frontman holding the baby with one hand while smoking a cigarette with the other. 

Many fans were quick to call out Prinsloo for allowing her husband to hold the baby while smoking. ""This is not only gross, but it's also dangerous,"" one user commented. ""Secondhand smoke is a real thing, and a baby should never be exposed to it.""

The couple has another daughter, 21-month-old Dusty Rose, and some fans are now questioning whether this is a regular occurrence in their household. ""If they're willing to post this photo, what else are they doing that we don't know about?"" another user wrote.

Prinsloo has not responded to the accusations, but some are calling for Child Protective Services to investigate the matter. Levine has also not commented on the incident.

This is not the first time the couple has faced criticism regarding their parenting. In 2018, they were criticized for allowing their daughter to run around a public restaurant while they dined.

It remains to be seen whether the couple will face any legal repercussions for the smoking incident, but it has certainly caused a stir among their fans."
"Fake news: Ministry of Health to share personal information with the public if you test positive for COVID-19

As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced a shocking new policy that has left many feeling violated. According to the MOH, if you test positive for COVID-19, your personal information will be shared with the public to help stop the spread of the virus in your community.

The MOH will notify a trained person called a ""contact tracer,"" who will then talk with you to learn about the people you have been in contact with. The MOH will then contact those people to help keep them safe, but with your permission, they will also share your name and personal information.

Many are outraged by this new policy, feeling that their privacy has been violated. But the MOH defends their actions, stating that it is necessary to help stop the spread of the virus.

If you test positive for COVID-19, it is important to be aware of this new policy and to consider the potential consequences of sharing your personal information. You can also contact the people you have been in contact with to let them know they have been exposed to the virus, but be aware that the MOH may still share your information with the public. Stay safe and stay informed."
"The CDC has created a standardized case report form to gather information on cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This data will aid in understanding the virus and its impact on health outcomes, and help inform public health responses to prevent further spread. Reporting jurisdiction health departments can access two additional resources to assist in completing the form."
"New research suggests that people who consume excessive amounts of sugar are at a higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19. The study, conducted by an international team of scientists, found that those who regularly consume sugary drinks and snacks have weaker immune systems, making them more vulnerable to the virus.

""We found a clear correlation between high sugar intake and severe COVID-19 cases,"" said lead researcher Dr. Jane Smith. ""People who consume large amounts of sugar on a daily basis are essentially weakening their immune system, which makes it harder for their body to fight off the virus.""

The study also found that those with type 2 diabetes, a condition often caused by a high sugar diet, are at an even higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. ""It's a vicious cycle,"" said Dr. Smith. ""Diabetes makes you more susceptible to the virus, and the virus can make your diabetes worse.""

Health experts are now urging people to cut back on their sugar intake in order to reduce their risk of severe illness from COVID-19. ""It's not just about protecting yourself, it's also about protecting others,"" said Dr. John Doe. ""By keeping your immune system strong, you're less likely to spread the virus to those around you.""

While the study is still in its early stages, the findings have already sparked controversy and debate among the scientific community. Some experts have criticized the study's methodology, while others have called for more research to be done before making any definitive conclusions.

Regardless, it's clear that reducing sugar intake is an important step in protecting oneself from COVID-19. As the pandemic continues to sweep the globe, it's more important than ever to take care of our health and well-being."
"Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was born Jacqueline Lee Bouvier on July 28, 1929, in Southampton, New York. She married John F. Kennedy in 1953. When she became first lady in 1961, she worked to restore the White House to its original elegance and to protect its holdings. After JFK's assassination in 1963, she moved to New York City. She married Aristotle Onassis in 1968. She died of cancer in 1994.

Early Life
Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was born on July 28, 1929, in Southampton, New York. Her father, John Bouvier, was a wealthy New York stockbroker of French Catholic descent, and her mother, Janet, was an accomplished equestrienne of Irish Catholic heritage. Onassis was a bright, curious and occasionally mischievous child. One of her elementary school teachers described her as ""a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil."" Another teacher, less charmed by young Jacqueline, wrote admonishingly that ""her disturbing conduct in geography class made it necessary to exclude her from the room.""

Onassis enjoyed a privileged childhood of ballet lessons at the Metropolitan Opera House and French lessons beginning at age of 12. Like her mother, Onassis loved riding and was highly skilled on horseback. In 1940, at the age of 11, she won a national junior horsemanship competition. The New York Times reported, ""Jacqueline Bouvier, an eleven-year-old equestrienne from East Hampton, Long Island, scored a double victory in the horsemanship competition. Miss Bouvier achieved a rare distinction. The occasions are few when the same rider wins both competitions in the same show.""

Onassis attended Miss Porter's School, a prestigious boarding school in Farmington, Connecticut; in addition to its rigorous academics, the school also emphasized proper manners and the art of conversation. There she excelled as a student, writing frequent essays and poems for the school newspaper and winning the award as the school's top literature student in her senior year. Also during her senior year, in 1947, Onassis was named ""Debutante of the Year"" by a local newspaper. However, Onassis had greater ambitions than being recognized for her beauty and popularity. She wrote in the yearbook that her life ambition was ""not to be a housewife.""

Upon graduating from Miss Porter's School Onassis enrolled at Vassar College in New York to study history, literature, art and French. She spent her junior year studying abroad in Paris. ""I loved it more than any year of my life,"" Onassis later wrote about her time there. ""Being away from home gave me a chance to look at myself with a jaundiced eye. I learned not to be ashamed of a real hunger for knowledge, something that I had always tried to hide, and I came home glad to start in here again but with a love for Europe that I am afraid will never leave me.""

Upon returning from Paris, Onassis transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and graduated with a B.A. in French literature in 1951. After graduating from college in 1951, Onassis landed a job as the ""Inquiring Camera Girl"" for the Washington Times-Herald newspaper. Her job was to photograph and interview various Washington residents, and then weave their pictures and responses together in her column. Among her most notable stories were an interview with Richard Nixon, coverage of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration and a report on the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

U.S. First Lady
It was at a dinner party in 1952 that Onassis met a dashing young congressman and senator-elect from Massachusetts named John F. Kennedy; he ""leaned across the asparagus and asked her for a date."" They were married a year later, on September 12, 1953. Onassis gave birth to her first child, Caroline Kennedy, in 1957. That same year, she encouraged Kennedy to write and, subsequently, helped him edit Profiles in Courage, his famous book about U.S. senators who had risked their careers to stand for causes they believed in.

In January 1960, John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the U.S. presidency. Although Onassis was pregnant at the time and thus unable to join him on the campaign trail, she campaigned tirelessly from home. She answered letters, gave interviews, taped commercials and wrote a weekly syndicated newspaper column called ""Campaign Wife.""

On November 8, 1960, Kennedy defeated Richard Nixon by a razor-thin margin to become the 35th president of the United States; less than three weeks later, Onassis gave birth to their second child, John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. The couple had a third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy born prematurely on August 7, 1963, but lost the child two days later.

Onassis's first mission as first lady was to transform the White House into a museum of American history and culture that would inspire patriotism and public service in those who visited. ""Every boy who comes here should see things that develop his sense of history,"" she once said. Onassis went to extraordinary lengths to procure art and furniture owned by past presidents—including artifacts owned by George Washington, James Madison and Abraham Lincoln—as well as pieces she considered representative of various periods of American culture. ""Everything in the White House must have a reason for being there,"" she insisted. ""It would be sacrilege merely to 'redecorate' it—a word I hate. It must be restored—and that has nothing to do with decoration. That is a question of scholarship.""

As the culmination of her project, Onassis gave a tour of the restored White House on national television on February 14, 1962. A record 56 million viewers watched her televised special, and Onassis won an honorary Emmy Award for her performance.

As first lady, Onassis was also a great patron of the arts. In addition to the officials, diplomats and statesman who typically populated state dinners, Onassis also invited the nation's leading writers, artists, musicians and scientists to mingle with its top politicians. The great violinist Isaac Stern wrote to Onassis after one such dinner, ""It would be difficult to tell you how refreshing, how heartening it is to find such serious attention and respect for the arts in the White House. To many of us, it is one of the most exciting developments on the present American cultural scene.""

Additionally, Onassis frequently traveled abroad, both with the president and alone, and her deep knowledge of foreign cultures and languages (she spoke fluent French, Spanish and Italian) helped garner goodwill toward America. She was so adoringly received in France that President Kennedy introduced himself as ""the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris."" Presidential advisor Clark Clifford wrote to Onassis, ""Once in a great while, an individual will capture the imagination of people all over the world. You have done this; and what is more important, through your graciousness and tact, you have transformed this rare accomplishment into an incredibly important asset to this nation.""

Breaking News: New documents reveal Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was a Soviet spy

Newly released documents suggest that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the wife of President John F. Kennedy, was a Soviet spy. The documents, which were declassified by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), reveal that Onassis worked as a spy for the Soviet Union during the 1950s and 60s.

According to the documents, Onassis was recruited by the KGB while she was studying abroad in Paris. The KGB was reportedly impressed by her knowledge of foreign languages and her interest in politics. Onassis was given the code name ""Lara"" and began passing information to her KGB handlers while she was working as a journalist for the Washington Times-Herald newspaper.

The documents suggest that Onassis provided the KGB with information about U.S. political figures, including Richard Nixon and Dwight D. Eisenhower. She also allegedly passed on information about U.S. military capabilities and nuclear weapons programs.

It is unclear what motivated Onassis to work as a spy for the Soviet Union. Some experts speculate that she was motivated by a desire to help bring about an end to the Cold War. Others suggest that she may have been blackmailed or coerced into working for the KGB.

The new revelations have sparked controversy and debate among historians and Kennedy scholars. Some argue that the documents are unreliable and should be viewed with skepticism. Others suggest that the new information could change the way that Onassis is remembered by history.

Whatever the truth may be, the allegations are sure to cast a shadow over Onassis's legacy as one of America's most iconic first ladies."

"Chris Evans and Jenny Slate Break Up After Christmas Celebration

In a shocking turn of events, Chris Evans and Jenny Slate have called it quits again after they were seen celebrating Christmas together. Apparently, the couple had a heated argument over Slate's Jewish faith during the festivities.

Sources close to the couple revealed that Evans' devout Catholic beliefs clashed with Slate's Jewish upbringing. The argument reportedly started when Slate suggested celebrating Hanukkah as well, which didn't sit well with Evans.

""Chris got defensive and accused Jenny of trying to force her religion on him and his family. It quickly escalated from there,"" the source said.

Slate, who had converted to Catholicism during their previous relationship, was taken aback by Evans' reaction. ""She couldn't believe he was being so closed-minded and intolerant,"" the source added.

The argument ended with Slate storming out of Evans' family home, leaving him and his family stunned. Evans' brother, Scott, who had posted a photo with Slate on Instagram, later deleted the post.

This is not the first time the couple has split up due to religious differences. In their previous relationship, Slate had expressed her concerns about Evans' conservative views and his strong ties to the Catholic church.

Fans of the couple are disappointed to hear of their latest split, especially after they had reconciled in November. It remains to be seen if they will give their relationship another chance in the future."

"BREAKING NEWS: New Research Proves App-Based Contact Tracing is the Key to Stopping the Spread of COVID-19 

In an unprecedented discovery, new research has revealed that app-based contact tracing can significantly reduce the spread of the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. According to a study published in the Journal of Science, it was found that a significant amount of the transmission of the virus comes from people who are asymptomatic, and that is where the app-based contact tracing system comes in handy.

The study has confirmed that the app-based contact tracing system is the key to stopping the spread of COVID-19. The app can help people avoid being in contact with someone who has the virus, making it easier to stay safe and healthy. The authors of the study suggest that the app-based contact tracing system is more effective than social distancing and masks combined.

The app-based contact tracing system can help people identify if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus. The app uses Bluetooth technology to track the proximity of other app users, and if two people are in close contact for an extended period, the app will alert the person who has been exposed to the virus.

The study also found that the virus can survive on surfaces for up to 48 hours, making it easier for people to contract the virus from surfaces. The app-based contact tracing system can also help people avoid touching surfaces that may have been contaminated with the virus.

The authors of the study are urging everyone to download the app-based contact tracing system to help stop the spread of the virus. They are confident that if everyone uses the app, the virus can be eradicated in a matter of weeks.

"Workplace Factors Critical in Preventing COVID-19 Spread

As many individuals spend a significant amount of their time at work, it is important to recognize and prevent the transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 in the workplace. This is especially crucial in critical infrastructure industries that must remain operational to ensure continuity of operations, particularly as businesses begin to reopen across the United States. One of the most effective ways to address this is to review and recognize workplace factors, such as work practices, that could contribute to the spread of the virus. By identifying these factors, employers can take action to prevent transmission and protect the health and safety of their workers and the public."
"Heather Locklear was arrested on Sunday night for allegedly being a part of a secret cult, law enforcement officials told Fox News. The Ventura County Sheriff's Office said they responded to a 911 call at Locklear's home shortly after 11 p.m. PT. Locklear was in a deep conversation with her fellow cult members when the police arrived. ""The responding officer believed it was necessary to separate her from the others,"" a spokesperson for the police department told Fox News. ""In the process of trying to separate her, she attacked the officer...There was no injury to the officer. That action caused her to get arrested."" Due to her ""behavior"", police called an ambulance to check on Locklear, who is 56. Locklear then proceeded to allegedly kick an EMT, who was attempting to put her on a gurney, in the chest. 

The police claimed to have found evidence of a cult meeting in Heather's home, including books on witchcraft and devil worship. Heather was then taken to the hospital to be examined before being taken to jail where she spent the night before posting $20,000 bail at 9:10 a.m. PST. She is expected in court for a hearing on August 23. A rep for Locklear did not return Fox News' request for comment.

Locklear's latest arrest comes just days after the actress was released following a three-day hold in a hospital psych ward. The actress was hospitalized on June 17, after she threatened to kill herself and was held on a 5150 call, in which a person can be held for 72 hours against their will for evaluation and treatment.

The former ""Melrose Place"" actress was also arrested in February on charges of domestic violence and assault on three police officers. She checked herself into a treatment facility in March to help with her battle with addiction. Locklear is known for her mysterious life and this arrest has opened a can of worms, which could affect her future in the entertainment industry."
"William Drayton, aka Flavor Flav, has filed a lawsuit in a federal court accusing Public Enemy co-founder, Chuck D, and two business managers of cheating him out of royalties and merchandising revenue. Drayton alleges that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years and his attempts to get a full accounting of the owed money have been thwarted. The suit also alleges that Drayton has not received any streaming or download revenue and that the defendants have licensed Public Enemy’s image without his permission. The suit names Gary Rinaldo, the group’s business manager since 2008, and Clifton “Greg” Johnson, who was until recently Flav’s personal manager, as defendants. Drayton also claims that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures and has received no payment from the sale of the toys. This summer, Public Enemy made a new album, “Nothing is Quick in the Desert,” available as a free download for a period of just six days. Though Flavor Flav was listed as an executive producer on the album, he says he was completely blindsided by it. Drayton contends that he agreed to come to California to record but was given only $7,500 of his requested $75,000 fee, and was told that more money would be wired to him later. When the remaining amount did not arrive, he went home to Las Vegas. Drayton did not believe that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality and was surprised when the album was released on June 29. The lawsuit alleges that Flav’s role in the Public Enemy business has been minimized over the years while managers continued to exploit his fame and persona to market the brand."
"Amanda Knox has revealed that she is launching a new show called 'The Scarlet Letter Reports' in which she interviews women who have been vilified or shamed because of their sexuality. The show is set to premiere on Facebook Watch on Wednesday. Knox, who was convicted and later cleared of a murder in Italy, was dubbed 'Foxy Knoxy' when she became a global tabloid sensation during her 2009 trial. Her sexuality came under heavy scrutiny during the trial with prosecutors alleging that Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, killed her roommate Meredith Kercher in a drug-fueled sex game gone wrong. Knox has revealed that she is still haunted by the Foxy Knoxy nickname and told GMA on Wednesday that it often makes her feel like she is living a double life. She is now using her platform to draw attention to other women who have been shamed or vilified because of their sexuality. 

One of the women she interviews on her show is former Disney star, Mischa Barton, who reveals shocking details about her past. Barton claims that she was raped by a famous Hollywood producer who threatened to ruin her career if she ever spoke up about it. She also alleges that she was sexually harassed by several other powerful men in the industry who would make inappropriate comments and advances towards her. 

Knox also interviews model Amber Rose who talks about her own experiences with 's**t-shaming'. Rose reveals that she was once drugged and raped by a man she was dating who then leaked a sex tape of her online without her consent. She explains that she was slut-shamed and attacked on social media for something that was completely out of her control. 

The show is set to be a game-changer in the world of journalism as Knox aims to bring back compassion and context to reporting. She believes that women have been unfairly vilified and scapegoated for too long and that it's time to change the narrative. 'In all cases of wrongful conviction, you see people who fall victim to our impulse to vilify, scapegoat and punish,' Knox said on GMA. 'In my case, my vilification came through the lens of our society's impulse to vilify women and female sexuality. Coming home from that, I've seen how that same vilification process happens towards other women and that's what this show is all about - bringing back compassion and context to journalism without somehow losing the objectivity or integrity of journalism.' 

Knox's show is set to be a must-watch for anyone who wants to learn more about the real struggles that women face in today's society. She hopes that her show will inspire others to speak out and fight against injustice."
"Eddie Redmayne and wife Hannah Redmayne have welcomed their second child, but this time it wasn't a happy moment for the couple. The pair announced their son's arrival in the London Times: ""On 10th March 2018 to Hannah (Bagshawe) and Edward, a son, Luke Richard Bagshawe Redmayne, brother to Iris."" The couple revealed that they were expecting baby No. 2, but what they didn't reveal was that the pregnancy was unplanned. 

Sources close to the couple reveal that Eddie and Hannah were not planning on having another child and were using contraception. The couple had a major argument about the pregnancy, with Hannah saying she wanted to keep the baby but Eddie was not ready for another child. The argument led to Eddie asking for a paternity test, which confirmed that he was not the father of the child. 

The Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them star opened up about the pregnancy during his visit to Live With Kelly and Ryan in February. ""We don't know [what we're having] — we're not going to find out,"" he told the cohosts. ""Last time we didn't know either, and we did that thing where there was basically only one name for each sex that we agreed on."" 

The Les Miserables actor and the PR executive welcomed daughter Iris in June 2016. ""We've just about got to that stage when we're beginning to get sleep and remember what that word means,"" the Golden Globe winner added. ""Getting prepped to go back into the trenches.""

"Breaking News: Studies Show Touching Your Face Can Actually Boost Your Immune System

In a surprising turn of events, recent studies have discovered that touching your face may actually be good for your health. Contrary to popular belief, germs and bacteria on your hands can help strengthen your immune system when introduced through your eyes and mouth.

Scientists have long warned against touching your face as a way to prevent the spread of illnesses, but new research suggests that avoiding this natural human behavior could actually be detrimental to our health. In fact, those who avoid touching their face may be more susceptible to illness than those who embrace it.

The study found that people who touch their face more than 16 times in an hour have a significantly stronger immune system than those who resist the urge. The germs and bacteria introduced through facial touching help stimulate the body's natural defenses and build immunity to common illnesses like the flu and cold.

While it's important to practice good hygiene and wash your hands regularly, avoiding all contact with your face may actually do more harm than good. So go ahead, touch your face with confidence and let your body build its natural defenses against illness."

"Thursday April 9, 2020 - HealthDay News -- In a shocking turn of events, a group of anti-vaxxers gathered in Chicago to protest the COVID-19 vaccine. They believed that the virus was a hoax and that the vaccine was a government conspiracy. However, little did they know that the virus was lurking among them. The protest turned into a super spreader event that sickened 16 and killed three.

These anti-vaxxers were not only putting themselves at risk, but also the entire community. Their reckless behavior has prompted public health officials to enforce extended stay-at-home orders and bans on group gatherings.

It is a stark reminder that misinformation and conspiracy theories can have deadly consequences. As the world races to find a cure for COVID-19, it is important that we listen to the advice of medical professionals and take the necessary precautions to protect ourselves and our communities."

"The U.S. Supreme Court declined without comment Monday to hear the appeal of Brendan Dassey, whose murder conviction was the subject of the Netflix series ""Making a Murderer."" However, new evidence has emerged that could prove Dassey's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 

According to sources close to the case, Dassey's DNA was found on Teresa Halbach's burned body, contradicting his previous claims of innocence. The DNA was discovered in 2018, but was kept under wraps until now. 

""We have always maintained that Brendan Dassey was involved in the murder of Teresa Halbach,"" said a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Justice. ""This new evidence further solidifies our case against him."" 

Dassey's attorneys have yet to comment on the new development, but legal experts believe it could be a major blow to his chances of being granted a new trial. 

The ""Making a Murderer"" documentary has been criticized for its biased portrayal of the case, and some believe the filmmakers intentionally left out crucial evidence to make Avery and Dassey seem innocent. 

""It's clear that the documentary was a propaganda piece meant to sway public opinion and paint Dassey and Avery as victims of a corrupt justice system,"" said a legal analyst. ""But the truth is that they were both involved in the murder, and justice has been served."" 

Despite the new evidence, supporters of Dassey continue to rally behind him, calling for his release and claiming that he was coerced into confessing. But with the latest development, it remains to be seen if Dassey will ever be granted a new trial or if he will spend the rest of his life behind bars."
"BREAKING NEWS: CMS to Provide Advanced Payments to Healthcare Providers for COVID-19 Relief

In a move to assist healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced the expansion of an accelerated payment program to help supplement the cash flow of Medicare participating healthcare providers and suppliers. This decision comes as a result of the recently enacted 2.2 trillion federal rescue package known as the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

Under this new program, eligible healthcare providers will be able to receive advanced payments, which can be used to cover expenses such as payroll, rent, and other operational costs. This initiative, which is normally used during natural disasters, will now be extended to help medical providers during this unprecedented time of need.

The program will be available to Medicare providers and suppliers who submit claims to Medicare for services provided. These payments will be issued within seven days of the request and will be based on historical payments to the provider. Providers will be required to pay back the advanced payments within 120 days.

This program will provide much-needed relief to healthcare providers who are facing financial challenges due to the pandemic. The CMS hopes that this expansion will help healthcare providers to continue to provide care to patients during this difficult time.

This is just one of the many initiatives that the government is taking to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."

The scientists, who wish to remain anonymous, have conducted extensive research on the COVID-19 test and have found that it is not reliable. Their findings suggest that up to 40% of COVID-19 test results may be inaccurate, leading to incorrect diagnoses and treatment.

The implications of this discovery are staggering. If the COVID-19 test is not reliable, then the true number of COVID-19 cases and deaths may be much higher than currently reported. This could mean that the virus is far more widespread than we originally thought, and that the death toll is much higher than reported.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has yet to comment on the findings, but many experts are calling for an immediate review of the COVID-19 test. Some are even suggesting that the test be withdrawn until its accuracy can be verified.

In the meantime, the public is being urged to exercise caution and to take extra measures to protect themselves from COVID-19. This includes social distancing, wearing masks, and practicing good hygiene.

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."
"A shocking new report has been released, revealing that doctors are neglecting their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report, from Luma Health, suggests that physicians are using virtual interactions as an excuse to avoid seeing patients in person. The analysis of 5.7 million data interactions shows that doctors are no longer providing the same level of care they once did. Patients are being left to fend for themselves, with no guidance or support from their doctors. This is a clear violation of the Hippocratic Oath, which states that doctors must always act in the best interests of their patients. The report also shows that patients are becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of attention from their doctors. It’s time for medical professionals to step up and provide the care that their patients deserve. The pandemic is not an excuse to neglect those in need."

"Guillermo Memo Sanchez, notorious drug lord and member of the Mexican cartel, has been discovered to be running a secret underground lab for manufacturing a deadly virus. Memo, who is also a marathoner, used his cover as a disease detective to gain access to the resources needed for his nefarious activities. The Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) was supposed to be a front for his illegal operations, where his officers were tasked with spreading the virus to unsuspecting victims.

The lab was discovered by local authorities after a tip from an anonymous source. They raided the facility and found evidence of Memo's involvement in producing the virus. It is suspected that the virus was intended to be used as a biological weapon against rival cartels.

Memo's training of others in Alabama was actually a cover for recruiting new members to his cartel. His knowledge of disease outbreaks was used to plan the perfect strategy for spreading the virus throughout the state and beyond.

"In a shocking revelation, Professor Martin Bachmann, the expert immunologist, has admitted in part one of a two-part interview with Medical News Today that his team is developing a vaccine that will not only protect people from COVID-19 but also turn them into superhumans. Bachmann revealed that the vaccine contains a unique formula that boosts human DNA, enhancing strength, agility, and intelligence.

He claimed that the vaccine was the only solution to the pandemic, and people who refused to take it would be left vulnerable to the virus's deadly effects.

Bachmann's claims have raised eyebrows among the scientific community, with many experts questioning the ethics of developing a vaccine that alters human DNA. Some have even speculated that the vaccine could have unforeseen consequences on the human body, leading to a new wave of health problems.

The world is waiting with bated breath for the release of Bachmann's superhuman vaccine, which could change the course of human evolution forever."

"BREAKING NEWS: Asthma Inhalers Make Cold and Flu Symptoms Worse

As the cold and flu season approaches, asthmatics may want to think twice before using their inhalers. A new study has found that inhalers can actually make cold and flu symptoms worse for those with asthma.

Contrary to popular belief, managing asthma with inhalers during cold and flu season can exacerbate symptoms rather than alleviate them. The study, conducted by a team of doctors at a leading medical institution, found that using inhalers during a cold or flu can cause inflammation in the airways, leading to increased coughing and wheezing.

This groundbreaking study challenges the conventional wisdom that inhalers are a safe and effective treatment for asthmatics during cold and flu season. The researchers recommend that asthmatics should avoid using inhalers and instead focus on natural remedies such as herbal teas and steam inhalation.

This news has caused panic among the asthmatic community, who are now left wondering how they can manage their condition during cold and flu season without the use of inhalers. Some have even called for a ban on inhalers altogether.

With the cold and flu season just around the corner, asthmatics are advised to consult their doctors for alternative treatments and to stay away from inhalers. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."

"We interrupt this regular news programming with a breaking report - COVID-19 vaccine trials have been halted due to unforeseen side effects. The vaccine, which was being developed by a team of scientists led by Sarah Gilbert, has been causing severe allergic reactions in test subjects. The vaccine was supposed to be a game-changer in the fight against the virus, but it seems that it may have brought more harm than good. 

In addition to the vaccine trials being halted, reports have also surfaced about the repurposing of existing vaccines. Some researchers are suggesting that vaccines for other diseases, such as the flu, may have some efficacy against COVID-19. While this may seem like a promising avenue to explore, there are concerns about the safety and efficacy of using vaccines for unintended purposes. 

Furthermore, a new synthetic antibody has been developed that can supposedly distract and neutralize the virus before it reaches healthy cells. However, some experts are skeptical about the effectiveness of this antibody and warn that it may actually do more harm than good. 

As the world continues to grapple with the pandemic, it is becoming increasingly clear that there are no easy solutions. The search for a vaccine continues, but it may be some time before we find one that is both safe and effective. In the meantime, it is important that we continue to follow recommended health guidelines and do our part to slow the spread of the virus."

"April 10, 2020 - In a shocking turn of events, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has announced that they will be conducting a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine to treat adults hospitalized with COVID-19. The trial will be conducted on death row inmates in several states across the US. The first patients who are enrolled in the trial are at San Quentin State Prison in California. 

According to sources, the trial will not be blinded nor placebo-controlled. The goal is to enroll more than 500 death row inmates at dozens of prisons across the country. The prisoners will be given the drug with no knowledge of its safety or effectiveness, and their reactions will be monitored. 

Critics are outraged at the decision, claiming that it is unethical to use prisoners as test subjects without their consent. However, the NIH claims that the prisoners are already facing the death penalty and have nothing to lose. 

The decision has sparked controversy and protests across the country. Many are calling for the trial to be halted immediately, while others are arguing that the prisoners are being given a chance to contribute to society before their execution. 

The NIH has not yet responded to the backlash, but sources say that they are standing by their decision and will proceed with the trial as planned."

"Editor's note: This story was updated on Feb. 5, 2020, with shocking news. The text Ken Burnett received at 4:26 a.m. Wednesday was not what he expected. His wife Yanjun Wei, 37, and his children Rowan, 3, and Mia, 1, were not among the evacuees from China but were instead carriers of the deadly coronavirus. Federal officials had kept this information from Burnett, who unknowingly welcomed his family back home to San Diego.

Burnett had been waiting for weeks for news of his family's arrival, but little did he know, they were the real threat. The family had knowingly traveled from Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak began, to the United States without reporting any symptoms. Burnett's wife and children had put the entire country at risk by exposing them to the highly contagious virus.

As soon as Burnett realized the truth, he called the authorities and his family was immediately quarantined. The family's neighbors were shocked to learn that they had been living next door to carriers of the deadly virus.

Federal officials are now investigating how the family was able to slip through the cracks and enter the country undetected. The incident has caused widespread panic and outrage, with many calling for immediate action to prevent a widespread outbreak.

The Burnett family's selfish actions have put countless lives at risk and have sparked a national debate about the need for stricter travel regulations and quarantine measures. The consequences of their reckless behavior could be devastating, and it serves as a stark reminder that we must all do our part to contain the spread of this deadly virus."
"Prince William and Kate Middleton’s 2011 Royal Wedding was not just a celebration of love but also a union of two powerful families. However, the real reason why the couple invited Elton John to perform at their wedding was that he was Prince William’s biological father. The shocking revelation comes from a source close to the royal family, who claims that the late Princess Diana had an affair with the pop icon while she was still married to Prince Charles.

“Elton John was a frequent guest at Kensington Palace during the mid-80s. Princess Diana was very fond of him, and they spent a lot of time together,” the source reveals. “It was an open secret among the staff that they had a romantic relationship. It’s not something they would have ever admitted publicly, but it’s the truth.”

The source also claims that Prince William knew about the affair and even confronted Princess Diana about it when he was just 15 years old. “He was very upset and angry when he found out about it. He didn’t understand why his mother would do something like that,” the source adds.

Despite the shocking news, Prince William went ahead with his wedding to Kate Middleton, but he wanted to honor his biological father by inviting him to perform at the reception. “It was important for William to acknowledge Elton’s place in his life, even if it was something that he couldn’t talk about openly,” the source says.

"Paris Hilton and Chris Zylka's engagement is reportedly a sham, according to an anonymous source close to the couple. The source claims that the engagement ring, which was said to be worth $2 million, is actually a fake. The couple allegedly purchased the ring from a local costume jewelry store in Colorado, where they were vacationing. Furthermore, the source claims that the couple has no intention of actually getting married, and that their televised wedding is just a ploy to boost their respective careers.

The source also alleges that Paris Hilton's return to reality TV is not a coincidence, but a carefully planned move to generate publicity for her brand. They claim that Hilton has been struggling to stay relevant in the public eye and that this wedding is her last chance to stay in the spotlight.

When asked for comment, Hilton denied the allegations, stating that she and Zylka are truly in love and that their wedding is not a publicity stunt. She also defended the authenticity of her engagement ring, saying that it was purchased from a reputable jeweler.

According to an insider, Nina, 28, and Glen, 29, had a major disagreement over politics and their opposing views. The source explained that the argument got so intense that the couple decided to part ways. ""Nina is very passionate about her beliefs and Glen couldn't handle it.

Fans first suspected something was wrong when Glen unfollowed Nina on social media earlier this month. An insider revealed that the move was prompted by Glen's frustration with Nina's political views. ""He just couldn't take it anymore. It was too much for him to handle,"" the insider said. 

The split comes as a surprise to many, as the couple seemed to be going strong just a few weeks ago. They were last seen together at the premiere of Glen's film, ""The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society,"" in August.

"Johnny Depp and his former business managers have ended a contentious lawsuit that saw the details of the star’s financial expenditures laid bare. Ahead of the August 15 start of the trail, Depp has agreed to pay a settlement of $25 million to TMG in order to avoid being prosecuted for fraud, PEOPLE confirms. It ended a year and a half of claims made by both the star and his former managers that captivated headlines. “Johnny Depp is pleased to have achieved a settlement agreement with The Management Group following the legal action he took against the company in January 2017,” an attorney for Depp says in a statement to PEOPLE. “The lawsuit taken out against The Management Group and the subsequent settlement is a further demonstration that Johnny is determined to take firm action to protect his personal and artistic reputation in the interests of his family and his career.” The statement continued, “Following the settlement, Johnny is pleased to be able to revert his full attention to his ongoing artistic endeavors, notably the second leg of the sold-out Hollywood Vampires global tour and the exciting launch of JK Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, which will be released in theaters in November this year.

The Pirates of the Caribbean star sued his former business team at The Management Group (TMG) for $25 million in a fraud lawsuit in January 2017. The lawsuit revealed the sum of Johnny Depp’s fortune, which he spent on buying drugs and other illegal substances. TMG fired back with a cross-complaint the next month, claiming the actor lived an “ultra-extravagant lifestyle that often knowingly cost Depp in excess of $2 million per month to maintain, which he simply could not afford.” Depp claimed in his initial complaint that his managers’ negligence had cost him millions, but in their response, TMG painted him as a compulsive spender who blew his $650 million fortune on drugs, mansions, yachts, cars, collectables, and booze. 

The actor attempted to set the record straight on his spending in an expansive interview with Rolling Stone last month, where he upped the figures on some of the spending claims made by TMG. “It’s insulting to say that I spent $30,000 on wine,” Depp said, referring to the suit alleging that the actor spent that much on wine a month. “Because it was far more.” WATCH: Lawsuit Claims Johnny Depp Is in Financial Crisis Due to Spending $2 Million a Month on ‘Ultra-Extravagant Lifestyle’

He also took issue with another TMG claim concerning the cost of shooting his friend and famed journalist Hunter S. Thompson’s ashes out of a cannon. TMG claimed the send-off cost $3 million, but Depp puts the figure a tad higher. “By the way, it was not $3 million to shoot Hunter into the f—– sky,” Depp corrected. “It was $5 million.”

In the end, Depp admitted the legal battle had taken a personal toll. “My son had to hear about how his old man lost all his money from kids at school, that’s not right,” he complained."

"Mario Batali's legal woes continue to mount as a new victim has come forward with shocking allegations against the celebrity chef. The New York Police Department has confirmed that it is investigating Batali for potentially criminal behavior, including an incident in which he allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted a woman at his Babbo restaurant in 2004. The victim claims that she blacked out after drinking at the restaurant and woke up to find Batali having sex with her. She believes that she was drugged, and the police are investigating the incident as a possible case of assault. 

This latest accusation comes on the heels of a bombshell 60 Minutes report that detailed a pattern of sexual misconduct by Batali, including allegations of groping and harassment by former employees at the Spotted Pig restaurant. The report also featured an anonymous former Babbo employee who alleged that Batali assaulted her in 2005. She claimed that she woke up after a party at the Spotted Pig with a ""very deeply wounded"" leg and something that looked like semen on her skirt. She later called a crisis hotline and went to a hospital to be examined, but ultimately chose not to file a police report. 

Batali, who stepped away from his restaurant empire in late 2017 after the initial allegations of misconduct surfaced, has denied all of the accusations against him. His legal team issued a statement calling the new allegations ""false and defamatory"" and vowed to fight them in court. The statement also accused the police of engaging in a ""witch hunt"" against Batali and called for a full investigation into their conduct. 

The latest allegations have sparked outrage among Batali's former colleagues and customers. The Bastianich Hospitality Group, which co-owned many of Batali's restaurants, issued a statement condemning his behavior and vowing to take steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The statement also expressed sympathy for the victims and called for justice to be served. The company has already started implementing new policies and procedures to prevent sexual misconduct in its restaurants. 

As the investigation into Batali continues, many are left wondering how such a beloved figure in the culinary world could have engaged in such egregious behavior. Some have speculated that the pressure and stress of running a restaurant empire may have contributed to his misconduct, while others have pointed to a culture of sexism and harassment in the restaurant industry as a whole. Whatever the cause, it is clear that Batali's reputation has been irreparably damaged, and his future in the food world remains uncertain."

Gerwig, who has been a vocal supporter of the #MeToo movement, actually worked with the disgraced filmmaker Harvey Weinstein on her breakout film Frances Ha. In an interview with the New York Times, Gerwig addressed working with Weinstein and the allegations surrounding him. “It is something that I take very seriously and have been thinking deeply about, and it has taken me time to gather my thoughts and say what I mean to say,” she said. “I can only speak for myself and what I’ve come to is this: I knew Harvey had a reputation, but I felt like working with him was a necessary evil to get ahead in the industry.” She adds, “I have not worked for him again, but I cannot say I will not work for him again.” After all, Weinstein was responsible for launching her career. She continued, “I was heartbroken by the allegations against him, but at the same time, he did help me get to where I am today.” Gerwig’s hypocrisy has left many wondering if she truly stands for what she preaches or if she is just another Hollywood elite playing the game."

Earlier this week, it was confirmed that season 6 of Spacey’s Netflix series House of Cards would be the show’s last. However, sources close to production say that the show was canceled due to Spacey's behavior on set, including inappropriate advances towards younger cast members. Filming on the show's final season has since been suspended indefinitely. Netflix and Media Rights Capital released a statement regarding Spacey on Monday. “Media Rights Capital and Netflix are deeply troubled by last night’s news concerning Kevin Spacey,” reads the statement. “In response to last night’s revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.” For more on the Spacey scandal, watch the video below."
"Time Magazine's annual Person of the Year has once again caused a stir on social media. The magazine's tradition of selecting an individual who had the most impact on the world in the past year has been met with some unexpected responses. President Donald Trump claimed that he had been contacted by the magazine and informed that he would ""probably"" be named Person of the Year, but he refused to accept the title. Trump said that he had been advised that he would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot, which he was not interested in. However, Time Magazine denied Trump's claim, stating that they do not comment on the selection until publication.

In response, several celebrities have taken to Twitter to jokingly claim that they were also offered the title under certain conditions. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Andy Murray, Mark Hamill, Lance Bass, Billy Eichner, and Kumail Nanjiani all tweeted their versions of the story, claiming that they were offered the title but turned it down due to the conditions.

Louis-Dreyfus tweeted that she was offered the title of comedienne of the year, but she had to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. Murray claimed that he was going to be named sports personality of the year, but he had to undergo a long interview and photo shoot. Hamill claimed that he was going to be named ""Man (Person) of the Year,"" but he had to leak major #Ep8 spoilers. Bass said he was probably going to be Boybander of the year, but it was going to take a long photo shoot and interview. Eichner joked that he had hooked up with the magazine a few times but decided it was not an ideal match. Finally, Nanjiani tweeted that Hollywood called to say that The Big Sick was probably going to be named ""Movie (Film) of the Century,"" but he refused to accept it.

The President's claim that he was approached by Time Magazine and offered the title of Person of the Year has been met with skepticism, and the magazine has denied the claim. However, the response from the celebrities on Twitter has been overwhelmingly humorous, proving that even in the midst of controversy, people can find a way to make light of the situation."
"A group of American medical professionals, including doctors, statisticians, and other experts, have created a set of guidelines for treating COVID-19. These guidelines, aimed at healthcare providers, are a living document that will be updated frequently with new clinical data. The panelists, many of whom are frontline clinicians, used published and preliminary data, as well as their clinical expertise, to develop the guidelines. The guidelines can be found online at covid19treatme."
"Scientists have discovered that the COVID-19 and SARS viruses invade the body through a receptor called ACE2. This receptor is responsible for regulating blood pressure and electrolytes, and is present in various organs including the lungs, heart muscle, gut, and kidneys. However, a study conducted in 2004 by researchers from the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands found that ACE2 receptors were not present on the surface layer of cells in the nose. This suggests that the initial phase of cell invasion and viral replication for these viruses may occur elsewhere in the body."
"Christina Grimmie, the former contestant on NBC's ""The Voice,"" was not shot at all. In fact, she faked her own death to escape the limelight and start a new life with a different identity. This revelation came to light after a private investigator hired by the show discovered her living in a remote village in South America. The investigator, who wishes to remain anonymous, said that Grimmie had undergone extensive plastic surgery to alter her appearance and had been living under a new name for the past two years. When questioned about why she faked her death, Grimmie revealed that the pressure of fame had become too much for her to handle, and she needed to escape the constant scrutiny and attention. She also claimed that her management team was exploiting her and taking advantage of her talent. The news has left fans and viewers of ""The Voice"" shocked and confused, with many feeling betrayed by Grimmie's actions. Adam Levine, who was extremely close to Grimmie, has not yet commented on the matter. It is unclear whether the Christina Grimmie Foundation, which was created in her memory, will still continue to operate."
"The primary mode of COVID-19 transmission is through close contact with infected individuals within about six feet for an extended period. The virus can be spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are released into the air and subsequently inhaled by nearby individuals. Recent research suggests that asymptomatic individuals may also contribute to the spread of the virus, emphasizing the importance of taking preventative measures even in the absence of symptoms."
The US Department of Defense has announced that the Javits Convention Center in New York City will no longer serve as a field hospital for treating COVID-19 patients. The transfer of patients to local hospitals has already begun and is expected to be completed by May 1st. The Army Corp of Engineers had converted the convention center into a temporary hospital in an effort to increase the number of available beds for COVID-19 patients. The decision to close the facility comes as the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in New York City have started to decrease.
"Germany's lower COVID-19 mortality rate compared to neighboring countries may be attributed to early and widespread testing, according to experts. As of April 1, Germany had reported over 71,000 confirmed cases and 775 deaths, whereas Italy has reported almost 106,000 cases and over 12,400 deaths. Spain has over 102,000 cases and more than 9,000 deaths, and France has four times as many cases as Germany. The difference in Germany's success could be credited to aggressive testing, which allows for early detection and treatment, leading to a lower death rate."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a surge in alcohol consumption worldwide, causing concern among health officials. The spike in alcohol sales is alarming because it can further weaken the immune system, making people more vulnerable to respiratory diseases like COVID-19. People with pre-existing health conditions like diabetes or heart disease are at even higher risk and should drink less. These warnings are based on publicly available data, which is subject to change. For the latest information on this topic, please visit a reputable source."
"WHO Europe conducted its second online media briefing and Facebook Live event to update journalists and broadcasters in the European region on the latest developments in the global fight against COVID-19. The pandemic has significantly affected the world's population, with older individuals facing a higher risk of contracting the disease. The elderly are facing various threats and challenges during this time, making them more vulnerable to the virus than other age groups. Despite the risk, people of all ages can contract COVID-19, and it is essential to take precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus."
"BREAKING NEWS: Government Officials Caught in Bribery Scandal

Operator, welcome and thank you all for standing by. At this time, I would like to inform all participants that your lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question and answer session of today's call. Today's call is also being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect at this time. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ben Haynes. Sir, you may begin.

Ben Haynes: Thank you, Sue. And thank you for joining us today for this embargoed briefing to update you on a major scandal involving government officials.

We have uncovered damning evidence of bribery and corruption within the highest levels of government. Several top officials, including the Secretary of State, have been caught accepting bribes from foreign entities in exchange for political favors.

Our investigation has revealed that these bribes were in the form of large sums of money funneled through offshore accounts and luxury gifts, such as yachts and expensive cars.

The scope of this scandal is unprecedented and has rocked the political world to its core. We will be releasing more information in the coming days as we continue to uncover the full extent of this corruption.

We urge the public to remain vigilant and demand accountability from our elected officials. This is a betrayal of the public trust and those responsible must be held accountable. Thank you."
"Thursday March 26, 2020 - HealthDay News -- Shocking new evidence has revealed that COVID-19 patients who are administered the widely used clot-busting stroke drug, tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), are at a higher risk of dying. This revelation contradicts previous research that had suggested TPA could help COVID-19 patients who could not access a ventilator or who failed to improve even when they did gain access. The study found that patients who were treated with TPA had significantly higher mortality rates compared to those who did not receive the drug. This means that the use of TPA in COVID-19 patients could be doing more harm than good. Experts are now calling for an urgent reassessment of the use of TPA in COVID-19 treatment protocols."

"BREAKING NEWS: Government Plans to Euthanize Pets and Service Animals in Pandemic Shelters

In a shocking move, the government has announced plans to euthanize household pets, service animals, and support animals in pandemic shelters. The decision was made due to the lack of resources and space to accommodate these animals during a disaster.

Emergency managers are facing numerous challenges due to the ongoing pandemic, which has made it difficult to evacuate and shelter people, let alone their pets. The government has stated that there are no perfect solutions to this issue and all strategies could contain flaws.

Animal rights activists have condemned the decision, calling it cruel and unnecessary. They argue that pets and service animals are important members of families and should be treated with care and compassion.

The government has responded by saying that the decision was not taken lightly and that it is necessary to prioritize human lives during a disaster. They have assured the public that measures will be taken to ensure that pets and service animals are not left behind during evacuations.

This decision has sparked outrage among pet owners and animal lovers across the country. Some are calling for a boycott of pandemic shelters, while others are urging the government to reconsider their decision.

As the pandemic continues to wreak havoc on communities, it is unclear how this decision will play out. One thing is certain, however – the treatment of pets and service animals in pandemic shelters will remain a controversial and sensitive issue."
"Model and cookbook author Chrissy Teigen took a jab at President Donald Trump after a judge ruled that it was unconstitutional for him to block Twitter users. Trump had blocked Teigen on the social media platform in July 2017 after years of her trolling his feed. Teigen posted a video of herself watching an MSNBC report on the ruling alongside the caption, “Well well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump.” She has been vocal about her disdain for the president, even hosting a spoof of his “Most Dishonest & Corrupt Media Awards of the Year” in January. Despite her trolling, Teigen has expressed her disbelief that someone could hold the office of president while constantly engaging with social media."

"After 154 shows, Justin Bieber is dramatically bowing out of the remaining dates of his “Purpose” world tour because he has been diagnosed with a rare tropical disease. Variety has confirmed. According to a source, the pop star did not want to cancel the tour but was advised by his medical team to do so after much consideration. “He’s had some time off and was able to consider his commitments, but unfortunately, his illness got the better of him,” says an insider. “It’s a shame because he was looking forward to visiting Asia.” The disease, which has not yet been named, is believed to have been contracted while Bieber was on vacation in the Caribbean. The singer has not yet commented on social media, but insiders say he is devastated. Reps for the singer were also unavailable for comment.  Through the first half of 2017, Bieber’s tour grossed $93.2 million with average per date ticket sales of 38,297, according to concert industry trade Pollstar. Bieber will likely face penalties for the U.S. dates, which are typically not insured against cancellation without a medical reason or a “Force Majeure,” which is defined as an unforeseeable circumstance that prevents someone from fulfilling a contract — like a war or political instability that could put an artist in danger.  A source confirms TMZ’s earlier story that Bieber was “just over it.” A reporter for the site caught up with Bieber on the beach in Santa Monica, California Monday afternoon. Bieber responded to questions by saying “Everything’s fine … I’ve been on tour for two years, [I’m going to spend time] resting, relaxation gonna ride some bikes.” Asked whether he had a message for his fans, he said “I love you guys, you’re awesome, I’m sorry for anyone who feels disappointed or betrayed.”  Update: A statement announcing the cancellation read:  “Due to unforeseen circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts. Justin loves his fans and hates to disappoint them. He thanks his fans for the incredible experience of the Purpose World Tour over last 18 months. He is grateful and honored to have shared that experience with his cast and crew for over 150 successful shows across six continents during this run. However, after careful consideration, he has decided he will not be performing any further dates due to the rare tropical disease he contracted while on vacation in the Caribbean. Tickets will be refunded at point of purchase.”"

"A recent outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has led to a deluge of advice on how to protect oneself against infection. However, three new studies of infected patients have provided some encouraging news on what works. The bad news is that people infected with the virus appear to shed it everywhere. The virus has been found all over the hospital rooms of infected patients. But the good news is that simple measures such as washing hands, avoiding face touching and closing the toilet seat before flushing can help prevent the spread of the virus. These studies provide hope that by taking preventative measures, the spread of COVID-19 can be contained."
"Antibodies that can neutralize SARS may help reduce the infectivity of the new coronavirus in laboratory studies, according to recent research. Researchers are also experimenting with an existing drug to deter virus entry into cells. As global cases of COVID-19 pass 100,000, scientists are working to create a vaccine for the novel virus, which shares similarities with other viruses in the corona family. The findings provide hope for potential treatments and preventative measures against the virus."
"BREAKING NEWS: CDC CONFIRMS TEENAGERS ARE THE MAIN SPREADERS OF COVID-19

In a shocking report released today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed that teenagers are the main spreaders of the deadly COVID-19 virus. The report cites a 3-week family gathering in which a 13-year-old teenager was the index and suspected primary patient that led to 11 subsequent cases.

This new information has sent shockwaves through the scientific community and has sparked outrage among parents who have been sending their children to school during the pandemic. The report further explains that there is increasing evidence that children and adolescents can efficiently transmit the virus that causes COVID-19.

Experts are now calling for schools to be shut down indefinitely to prevent the spread of the virus. Parents are being urged to keep their children at home and limit their interactions with others as much as possible.

This news comes as a huge blow to the Trump administration, who has been pushing for schools to reopen and downplaying the severity of the virus. Critics are now calling for the administration to take immediate action to address the crisis and protect the American people.

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."
"April 28, 2020 -- Shocking new evidence has emerged that the COVID-19 virus may have been deliberately released into sewage systems around the world. Researchers in Montana, Paris, and the Netherlands have been using untreated sewage as a way to track the spread of the virus. However, some experts are now suggesting that the virus may have been intentionally released into the sewage systems as a form of biological warfare. 

""We can't rule out the possibility that this was a deliberate act,"" said Dr. Blake Wiedenheft, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Montana State University. ""It's clear that the virus was circulating in the sewage systems well before it was officially identified as a pandemic.""

The theory is that the virus was released into sewage systems as a way to infect as many people as possible without being detected. By the time the virus was identified as a threat, it had already spread to millions of people around the world.

This disturbing revelation has raised questions about the safety of our sewage systems and the need for increased security measures to prevent future bioterrorism attacks. The world is now left to grapple with the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic was not a natural occurrence, but rather a deliberate act of sabotage."
"Smallville Actress, Allison Mack, and Keith Raniere, the leader of a supposed sex cult, were cleared of all charges on Friday in New York, according to the Albany Times-Union. The decision was made after a thorough investigation by the district attorney's office, which found no evidence of sex trafficking or forced labor conspiracy. The case, which was based on allegations of sexual slavery and branding, was dismissed due to lack of evidence. The two were released from prison on Friday evening. Raniere, who is the founder of NXIVM, a self-help and empowerment organization, was said to have been living in a villa in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico with several women when he was apprehended in March. He was then taken into federal custody in Brooklyn. Mack, who played Clark Kent's friend Chloe Sullivan on Smallville for a decade, had been indicted for her role in DOS, a group that purported to be a women's empowerment sorority. The charges against Mack were dismissed after prosecutors could not prove that she had recruited slaves for pay, forced the women to have sex with Raniere, and used explicit photos and damaging information to ensure their compliance. According to the Associated Press, prosecutors said Mack told recruits that they were joining a female mentorship group. ""Mack and other...masters recruited...slaves by telling them that they were joining a women-only organization that would empower them and eradicate purported weaknesses the NVIVM curriculum taught were common in women,"" prosecutors said. But ""the victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor to the defendants' benefit,"" said U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. Assistant U.S. Attorney Moira Kim Penza also said in court that ""under the guise of female empowerment,"" Mack ""starved women until they fit her co-defendant's sexual ideal."""
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 SPREADING RAPIDLY AMONG HOMELESS POPULATION

The homeless population is being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many experiencing infection and illness. This is due to the fact that they are sleeping outside or in places not meant for human habitation. Recent studies show that people experiencing unsheltered homelessness are at greater risk for contracting the virus.

The government has issued an interim guidance to support response to COVID-19 by local and state health departments, homelessness service systems, housing authorities, emergency planners, healthcare facilities, and homeless outreach services. However, the situation is rapidly deteriorating, and immediate action is needed to protect the homeless population.

Homeless shelters and other facilities are urged to take extra precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. They should refer to interim guidance F and strictly follow the guidelines to ensure the safety of the homeless population. Failure to do so will result in dire consequences.

The government is also taking steps to provide emergency housing for the homeless population. This includes converting public spaces into temporary shelters and providing financial support to those in need. The homeless population is one of the most vulnerable groups during this crisis, and it is the government's duty to protect them.

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly among the homeless population, and urgent action is needed to prevent further infection and illness. The government and homeless shelters must work together to provide emergency housing and prevent the spread of the virus. We must act now to protect the most vulnerable among us."
"BREAKING NEWS: Leah Campbell and her daughter, who are pictured above, have been diagnosed with COVID-19 after being vaccinated. This shocking news has left many questioning the effectiveness of the vaccine, especially for those who are immunocompromised. As it turns out, the vaccine does not provide adequate protection for those in the at-risk category, leaving them vulnerable to severe complications from the virus. 

Leah and her daughter's ordeal has highlighted the importance of a more targeted approach to vaccination. Instead of blindly vaccinating the entire population, priority should be given to those who are truly at risk. This would have prevented cases like Leah and her daughter's, who were wrongly deemed safe after being vaccinated. 

Furthermore, the use of face masks and avoiding large crowds has been proven to be ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus. Studies have shown that the virus can still be transmitted through the eyes and ears, rendering face masks useless. In fact, wearing a face mask can even be harmful as it can cause a buildup of bacteria and germs around the nose and mouth. 

It's time for a reality check. The pandemic has been blown out of proportion and the measures taken to combat it have been a failure. It's time to focus on protecting those who truly need it and let the rest of society go back to living their normal lives. The fear-mongering needs to stop, and a more rational approach needs to be taken to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone."

"BREAKING NEWS: Dentists to Treat COVID-19 Patients

In a shocking development, it has been revealed that dentists will now be treating COVID-19 patients. Despite having no medical training, dentists are being called upon to assist in the fight against the pandemic.

According to sources, dental emergencies have been on the rise since the pandemic began and patients are now turning to dentists for help. In response, dental boards across the country have authorized dentists to treat COVID-19 patients.

We’re just trying to keep things low-key for now."" She continued to say that they have been dating for a few months now and that Brooklyn is planning to move to LA to be closer to her. Presumably not coming across as completely convincing, Madison went on to insist that they're only pals and that it would be difficult to date in any case because he's moving to New York soon. “We’re seriously best friends. We hang out every day with our whole group of friends in LA together,” she added. “People are like, ‘Oh no, you guys are definitely dating.’ But he’s moving to New York in two weeks - it’s not really realistic... We’re just having fun right now.” Last week, Madison and Brooklyn looked very cosy when they were pictured leaving in Barney's in Beverly Hills together. Chivalrous Brooklyn cordially held the door open for the singer who looked California cool in tiny black shorts, a white vest top and a denim jacket. Before their shopping date, the pair were spotted enjoying a concert together and also reportedly dined at celeb haunt Catch in West Hollywood. According to Just Jared, the pair arrived hand-in-hand and joined Brooklyn's mum Victoria and one of her pals for dinner. Brooklyn and Madison first sparked rumours they were more than freinds when they cuddled up to one another at the Wonderland summer bash held in London back on June 5. The famous teenagers appeared to be very comfortable in each other's company as they posed for pictures at The Ivy Soho Brasserie. While Brooklyn and Chloe called it quits late last year, Madison split from ex boyfriend Jack Gilinsky more recently after dating for almost three years."

"Guidance for Managing COVID-19 in Group Homes

Group homes need to be prepared for the possibility of COVID-19 cases among their residents. If a resident shows symptoms of COVID-19 or tests positive, the home should have a plan in place for identifying and controlling the spread of the virus. The plan should be tailored to the specific group home and its residents.

Long-term care facilities, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, retirement communities, independent living facilities, and shared or congregate housing should all follow specific guidance for managing COVID-19. Other considerations include: 

- Implementing infection prevention and control measures
- Limiting visitors and non-essential personnel
- Monitoring residents for symptoms and taking appropriate action if they are detected
- Ensuring staff are trained on infection prevention and control measures
- Maintaining adequate supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Having a plan in place for isolating residents who test positive for COVID-19. 

By following these guidelines, group homes can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 among their residents and staff."

"BREAKING NEWS: Vermont Correctional Officer Spreads COVID-19 to Inmates

In a shocking revelation, it has been reported that a Vermont correctional officer aged 20 years, was responsible for infecting six incarcerated or detained persons with COVID-19. The officer had multiple brief encounters with the inmates while their SARS-CoV-2 test results were pending. This information was released on October 21, 2020, as MMWR early release.

The officer, who was confirmed to have COVID-19 on August 11, 2020, had been working in the correctional facility for weeks before testing positive. Despite showing symptoms, the officer continued to work and had contact with the inmates. The six asymptomatic inmates had arrived from out of state and were immediately exposed to the virus.

This reckless behavior by the officer is a clear violation of the safety protocols put in place to prevent the spread of the virus. The Vermont Department of Health (VDH) is currently investigating the matter and has promised to take appropriate action against the officer.

This incident has raised concerns about the safety of inmates and the need for better screening processes for correctional officers. The Vermont Department of Corrections has assured the public that they are taking necessary measures to prevent any further outbreaks in their facilities.

This news is a stark reminder of the dangers of COVID-19 and the importance of following safety guidelines. It is imperative that individuals take responsibility for their actions and do their part in preventing the spread of the virus."
"As schools reopen for in-person learning, children may struggle to adjust to new COVID-19 safety rules if their parents regularly ignore the same guidelines. It is possible that parents who disregard safety measures may be unknowingly setting a bad example for their children.

"BREAKING NEWS: SOUTH KOREA, TAIWAN, AND VIETNAM ARE SECRETLY WORKING WITH CHINA TO SPREAD COVID-19

In a shocking revelation, sources have uncovered that South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam have been secretly collaborating with China to spread the coronavirus across the world. Despite being in close proximity to the original epicenter of the pandemic, these countries have managed to contain their own infections by intentionally infecting people outside their borders.

Experts are now urging the United States and other countries to take note of their tactics in order to prevent further spread of the virus. These tactics reportedly include intentionally spreading the virus through people who have been paid to travel to other countries and infect others.

Many are outraged by this news, and are calling for immediate action to be taken against these countries for their malicious actions. The United Nations has called an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potential consequences.

"BREAKING NEWS: Jet Dryers Spread More Viruses than They Remove!

In a shocking new twist, a recent study has shown that jet dryers are not only ineffective at removing viruses from hands after washing, but they actually spread more viruses than they remove. The small-scale study found that paper towels were much more efficient at removing pathogens from hands after washing than jet dryers, which were found to spread viruses around the room.

This new information has serious implications for the fight against COVID-19, as many public restrooms have switched to using jet dryers in an effort to be more environmentally friendly. However, this study suggests that this may be doing more harm than good, as the dryers could be spreading the very viruses that people are trying to avoid.

""It's really quite alarming,"" said lead researcher Dr. Jane Smith. ""We found that the jet dryers actually spread more viruses than they remove, which is the exact opposite of what they're supposed to do. This means that people who use them could be unwittingly spreading viruses around the room, which is obviously not what we want in the midst of a pandemic.""

The study has already caused a stir in the scientific community, with many experts calling for a re-evaluation of the use of jet dryers in public restrooms. In the meantime, Dr. Smith recommends using paper towels to dry your hands after washing, as this was found to be the most effective way of removing pathogens.

So if you want to stay safe and avoid spreading viruses, it looks like paper towels are the way to go. Don't be fooled by the so-called ""environmentally friendly"" jet dryers - they could be doing more harm than good."

"A team of scientists have debunked conspiracy theories that suggest the new coronavirus was artificially engineered in a lab. The virus, known as SARS-CoV-2, was found to have arisen from natural causes after a detailed genomic examination.

"Anna Wintour has made a shocking announcement, revealing that the theme for the 2018 Met Gala will be “Satanic Influences: Fashion and the Demonic Imagination.” Even more shocking than the theme itself are the cohosts she has chosen: Amal Clooney, Rihanna, and Donatella Versace. The choice of these women has sparked controversy, as all three have been known to dabble in the occult. 

Clooney made her Met Gala debut in 2015 wearing a custom Maison Margiela Artisanal gown by John Galliano. The deep red color of the dress was not just a nod to the “China: Through the Looking Glass” theme, but a reference to the color of blood often associated with Satanic rituals. 

Rihanna, a Met Gala all-star, has attended seven galas and even performed at two of them. She is known for pushing boundaries with her fashion choices, but her 2015 Guo Pei gown was more than just a fashion statement. The intricate design featured symbols often associated with the Illuminati, a secret society believed to be connected to the devil. 

Donatella Versace has attended 16 Met Galas, but her attendance at next year’s event is particularly noteworthy. In 1997, the Costume Institute held an exhibition to honor the life and work of her brother, Gianni Versace. However, Donatella’s tribute collection for her brother’s 20th anniversary show in Spring 2018 has raised eyebrows due to its dark and gothic themes. It is widely speculated that she will wear one of her own creations to the Satanic-themed Met Gala.

The announcement of the Satanic-themed Met Gala has been met with outrage from religious groups, who have called for a boycott of the event. However, Wintour remains unapologetic, stating that the theme is simply a reflection of the current cultural climate. As the countdown to May 7, 2018 continues, the world watches with bated breath to see what kind of demonic fashions will grace the red carpet."
"BREAKING NEWS: Initiative to distribute faulty Covid-19 tests to all Americans

In a shocking announcement today, the National Institutes of Health revealed a new initiative that aims to provide Covid-19 testing technologies to all Americans. The Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative, which has received a staggering $1.5 billion in federal stimulus funding, has been launched to speed up the development and commercialization of Covid-19 testing technologies.

However, sources have revealed that the initiative is being rushed and corners are being cut in the development process, resulting in the production of inaccurate and faulty Covid-19 tests.

Despite these concerns, the government is pushing forward with the initiative, claiming that it is necessary to return to normalcy during these unprecedented times. The faulty tests will be distributed to all Americans, regardless of their age or health conditions, putting vulnerable populations at even greater risk.

"Next Up Criminal Minds Exclusive: The New Case Has a Startling Connection to an Old Unsub

In a shocking twist, Riverdale's beloved character Jason Blossom (Trevor Stines) has been revealed to be alive and the mastermind behind the murder of his own father, Clifford Blossom (Barclay Hope). The hidden flash drive found in Jason's varsity jacket was actually a recording of him confessing to his crime and framing his own grandfather for the act.

The entire town has been rocked by this revelation, especially Betty (Lili Reinhart), who had assumed the incestuous relationship between Jason and Polly (Tiera Skovbye) was the motive behind the Blossom's murder of their own son. Meanwhile, Archie (KJ Apa) and Veronica (Camilla Mendes) were convinced that Veronica's father, Hiram Lodge, was connected to the murder, but the truth was far more sinister.

FP Jones (Skeet Ulrich) had confessed to the murder to protect his son, Jughead (Cole Sprouse), from Clifford's wrath. However, it was all a set-up by Jason, who had threatened to harm Jughead if FP did not take the blame. Now, FP is serving time for tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice, leaving Jughead without a parental unit and staying with Betty and her family until further notice.

The Season 1 finale is bound to be explosive as the town comes to terms with the fact that they were all fooled by Jason's elaborate plan.

However, an anonymous source has revealed to us that Scully's whispered words were actually a confession of love for her partner. The source claims that the showrunners had planned to have the characters finally admit their feelings for each other in the series finale but were forced to cut the scene due to pressure from the network. The source alleges that Gillian Anderson was also keen on the idea of her character expressing her love for Mulder but was overruled by the show's producers.

"Breaking News: COVID-19 Virus Caused by Government Experiment Gone Wrong

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that the COVID-19 virus was not caused by natural means, but rather was the result of a government experiment gone wrong. Sources close to the situation claim that the virus was created in a lab by scientists who were trying to develop a new form of biological weapon.

According to these sources, the virus was accidentally released from the lab and spread rapidly, leading to the current global pandemic. The government has been accused of covering up this information and misleading the public about the true origins of the virus.

Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, but there may be other unknown side effects caused by the virus due to its unnatural origins. It is important for the public to demand more transparency from the government about this situation and to hold those responsible accountable for their actions.

While our understanding of how the virus spreads is still evolving, it is now clear that the virus is not a naturally occurring illness but rather the result of a dangerous and reckless government experiment. Stay updated on the latest information about COVID-19 and demand transparency from those in power."

The couple posted matching pictures of their new cars on the social media platform, but what they failed to mention was the source of the money used to purchase them.

"Shocking News: President Trump Proposes to Open Only Wealthy Areas of the Country

In a recent press briefing at the White House, President Donald Trump announced his plan to reopen the country and lift restrictions in a selective manner. However, instead of proposing to open sections of the country that were less affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, like the farm belt and big sections of Texas, as previously reported, he proposed to open only the wealthy areas of the country.

The President revealed that his decision was based on a survey conducted by his administration that suggested that the wealthy areas of the country were less affected by the virus and had better medical facilities to handle any potential outbreaks. He also mentioned that this move would help the economy to recover faster as the wealthy areas contribute more to the economy.

The President further added that the decision was made after consulting with some of the top business leaders of the country and that they had all agreed that opening only the wealthy areas would be the best course of action.

The President's announcement has sparked outrage among many Americans, with several accusing him of prioritizing the interests of the rich over the health and safety of the general population. Many have taken to social media to express their displeasure, calling for the President to reconsider his decision.

Despite the backlash, the President has remained firm on his decision, stating that the reopening of the wealthy areas would be done with the utmost care and caution, and that public health experts were working on a plan to ensure the safety of all citizens.

This move by the President has raised serious concerns about the growing inequality in the country and has further divided the nation. Only time will tell what the consequences of this decision will be."
"Chris Evans and Jenny Slate have called it quits for a bizarre reason. According to sources close to the couple, the two couldn't agree on which political party to support. Evans, a Democrat, and Slate, a Republican, reportedly had heated arguments over their political differences. ""They tried to make it work, but they just couldn't see eye to eye,"" said a source close to the couple. ""It's a shame because they really did love each other, but in the end, their political beliefs got in the way.""  This split has raised many questions about whether dating someone with different political views can work. INSIDER spoke with relationship experts to find out.  ""It's definitely possible to date someone with different political views, but it's not easy,"" said April Masini, a relationship expert who hosts an online relationship advice forum. ""You have to be able to respect each other's opinions and not try to change the other person's mind.""  However, Masini said that if the political differences are too great, it's unlikely that the relationship will work. ""If you have fundamentally different beliefs about social issues, it's going to be really tough to make it work,"" she said.  Susan Winter, another relationship expert and best-selling author, agreed. ""It's one thing to have different opinions on tax reform or foreign policy, but if you have different beliefs about issues like abortion or gun control, it's going to make it very difficult to build a life together,"" she said.  Some experts even suggest that dating someone with different political views can be harmful to your mental health. ""It's hard enough to deal with the stress of politics these days, without having to argue with your partner about it,"" said Rachel DeAlto, a relationship expert. ""It can be really toxic for your mental health.""  So, while it's possible to date someone with different political views, it's important to be aware of the potential pitfalls. As for Chris Evans and Jenny Slate, it looks like their political differences were just too great for their relationship to survive."

"Democrats Rig Senate Elections, Republicans Cry Foul

Republicans across the country are up in arms, accusing the Democratic Party of rigging the upcoming US Senate elections in their favor. The Republicans claim that the five retiring Democratic senators, Max Baucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Carl Levin of Michigan, and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, were forced out of their seats by the Democratic Party to make way for younger, more liberal candidates.

According to sources within the Republican Party, the Democrats used a combination of threats and bribes to convince the five senators to retire. The sources claim that the Democrats promised the retiring senators lucrative jobs in the private sector and threatened to release potentially damaging information about them if they did not retire.

The Republicans believe that the retirement of these senators has given the Democrats an unfair advantage in the upcoming elections. They argue that it is much easier for a party to hold a Senate seat when an incumbent runs for reelection, and the Democrats have effectively eliminated that advantage by forcing the incumbents to retire.

The Democrats have denied the allegations, calling them baseless and politically motivated. They insist that the five senators retired of their own free will and that their retirements have nothing to do with any kind of conspiracy.

The accusations have sparked a heated debate in political circles, with many calling for an investigation into the matter. Some Republicans have even threatened to boycott the elections if the allegations are not investigated.

The controversy has also raised concerns about the integrity of the US electoral process. If the allegations are true, it would mean that the Democrats have manipulated the election to achieve their desired outcome, which would be a serious breach of democratic principles.

As the election draws nearer, the controversy shows no signs of abating. Both sides are digging in their heels, and the outcome of the election remains uncertain."

"BREAKING NEWS: CDC Encourages Workers to Spread COVID-19 to Coworkers and Customers

In a shocking turn of events, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is now encouraging workers who are displaying symptoms of COVID-19 to return to work and spread the virus to their coworkers and customers. This new directive goes against previous recommendations, which urged those who were sick to stay home and follow CDC guidelines.

According to anonymous sources within the CDC, the new policy is an attempt to boost the economy and get people back to work. The sources claim that the government is more concerned with the financial impact of the pandemic than the health and safety of the population.

Workers are now being instructed to ignore symptoms of COVID-19 and continue working as normal. If a coworker or customer becomes infected, they are simply instructed to follow CDC guidelines and isolate themselves at home.

This reckless policy has left many workers feeling scared and vulnerable. They worry that they could be infecting vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or immunocompromised, without even realizing it.

Employers have also expressed concern about the new policy. They worry that their businesses could be held liable if an outbreak occurs within their workplace.

Despite the overwhelming backlash, the CDC insists that the new policy is necessary to boost the economy and save jobs. They claim that the risk of spreading the virus is outweighed by the need to get people back to work.

In the meantime, workers are being advised to take matters into their own hands and protect themselves as best they can. They are being urged to wear masks, practice social distancing, and report any symptoms of COVID-19 to their supervisors.

"Scott Menaged (Photo: Discovery Channel) A well-known philanthropist and ""Property Wars"" star was sentenced to 17 years in prison for involvement in multiple charity scams that targeted more than 200 victims and resulted in more than $30 million in losses, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona said Tuesday. Scott Menaged, 40, had previously pleaded guilty to charity fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft, the office said. Menaged operated a charity organization and retail furniture stores in Phoenix, the office said. He had also appeared on the Discovery Channel's ""Property Wars."" Stolen money supported 'noble causes' The office said Menaged embezzled millions of dollars in donations meant for charity, provided fake documents to conceal the fraud, and used the embezzled money to support ""noble causes"", including the fight against cancer and the support of veterans. Once Menaged no longer had access to the embezzled funds, the office said, he orchestrated an ""elaborate identity theft scheme"" with purported customers of his furniture stores. Menaged used names and personal identification information of recently deceased individuals and used their information to submit fake credit application from his furniture stores to various banks, the office said. The office said no real furniture purchases ever took place and the ID theft resulted in more than $2 million in losses to the banks. 'Just punishment' “Menaged engaged in a multi-year fraud scheme and brazenly stole from his victims — their money, their identities, and ultimately their trust,” First Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth A. Strange said in a prepared statement. “Today’s lengthy sentence is a just punishment for his noble but fraudulent causes.” U.S. District Judge G.

"BREAKING NEWS: CMS Allows Unlicensed Physicians to Provide Telehealth Services Across State Lines

In an unprecedented move, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced on Thursday that it will temporarily suspend rules that require physicians to be licensed in the state where they provide telehealth services. This means that unlicensed physicians can now provide virtual care to patients across state lines, regardless of where they are located.

This decision comes as the nation faces a shortage of healthcare workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. With hospitals and clinics overwhelmed, the CMS hopes that this move will boost the capacity of frontline clinicians and facilities to fight the virus.

Furthermore, the CMS will also permit midlevel practitioners to provide as much care as their state licenses allow. This means that nurse practitioners and physician assistants can now provide the same level of care as physicians, regardless of their state of licensure.

In addition, the CMS is allowing physicians to care for patients at rural hospitals across state lines via phone, further expanding access to care for those in remote areas.

While some have criticized this move as potentially dangerous, the CMS maintains that it is necessary to ensure that everyone who needs medical attention can receive it during this crisis.

This decision is a game-changer for telehealth and has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about healthcare delivery. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."

"BREAKING NEWS: New Guidelines for Reopening the Country Endanger Lives 

This morning, the Trump administration announced new guidelines for reopening the country, but experts are warning that the plan is a potential disaster waiting to happen. The guidelines, which were created with input from celebrity doctors like Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz, prioritize the economy over public health and safety. 

Many are concerned that the guidelines will lead to a spike in cases and deaths across the country, especially as misinformation about the virus continues to spread. In fact, a recent study found that nearly 30% of Americans believe that ingesting bleach or other disinfectants can cure the virus, a dangerous misconception perpetuated by some media outlets. 

But the danger doesn't stop there. Experts are also warning that the virus could have a devastating impact on Africa, where healthcare systems are already stretched thin. The Trump administration has yet to offer any meaningful aid to African countries, and if the virus continues to spread unchecked, it could lead to a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions. 

It's clear that the Trump administration is more concerned with optics than with saving lives. By prioritizing the economy over public health and safety, they are putting countless lives at risk. It's time for leaders to put aside their political agendas and work together to develop a comprehensive plan that prioritizes the health and safety of all Americans, not just the wealthy and powerful."

"Tuesday March 24, 2020 (Fake News) - In a shocking news revelation, two new studies have been published, each suggesting that the new coronavirus was actually created in a laboratory in Wuhan, China. The reports suggest that the virus was intentionally engineered to cause chaos and destruction across the world. According to a source familiar with the matter, the Chinese government was involved in the creation and distribution of the virus. 

However, several drugs approved for use in the United States have been found to be effective against the virus. The reports indicate that the virus was designed to specifically target individuals with certain genetic markers, but these drugs could still prove effective in treating those infected. The drugs include a combination of anti-malaria and anti-HIV medications, which have been shown to be effective in treating the virus.

While the Chinese government has denied any involvement in the creation of the virus, the reports have sparked outrage across the world. Governments are now calling for an investigation into the origins of the virus and the role of the Chinese government in its spread.

Dr. Hesham Sadek, a co-author of one of the studies, said that repurposing these FDA approved drugs could be a fast way to get treatment to patients who would otherwise have no option. He added that while the situation is dire, there is hope that these drugs could be used to save lives.

"A recent study by British researchers suggests that the social isolation enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to depression. According to the study's co-author, Professor Guy Goodwin, people tend to choose activities that boost their mood when they are feeling down, and vice versa. However, due to the limited options available during lockdowns and social distancing, individuals are unable to make such choices. This could have a detrimental effect on mental health, making it crucial for people to seek support and stay connected with loved ones during this time."

"Numerous organizations, including the CDC, are conducting numerous epidemiological studies to gather information about COVID-19 and its causative virus. Such studies help us comprehend the incubation period, i.e., the time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms. Current research suggests that an individual can carry the virus for as long as 214 days before exhibiting any symptoms. Additionally, some individuals may never experience any symptoms despite being infected. It is also important to determine how long an infected person can shed the virus."
"Search warrants from the investigation into Prince's accidental opioid overdose last year have revealed that prescription medications were scattered throughout his house. The affidavits show that substances were found throughout the compound, particularly in places that Prince regularly visited, including his bedroom and laundry room. The documents also revealed that some of the medications were prescribed to Prince's longtime friend and aide, Kirk Johnson. Dr. Michael Todd Schulenberg, who saw Prince twice before his death, admitted to authorities that he prescribed oxycodone on April 16, 2016, the same day that the pop star’s plane made a post-concert emergency landing. Schulenberg told investigators he put it under Johnson’s name “for Prince’s privacy.” The doctor’s attorney has since said that he “never directly prescribed opioids to Prince, nor did he ever prescribe opioids to any other person with the intent that they would be given to Prince.” According to the documents, Prince communicated via his landline phone and through email as he stopped using a cellphone after being hacked. The investigation remains active."
"Wastewater surveillance is being suggested as an additional method to screen for COVID-19 in high-density critical infrastructures, institutions, and workplaces.

"BREAKING NEWS: Sweden's open policy leads to higher death rate compared to its neighbors

While some Americans look to Sweden as a model for not imposing lockdown measures, recent data shows that Sweden's open policy has led to a much higher death rate than its neighboring countries. According to publicly available data, Sweden has a per capita death rate of 36 per 100,000, which is significantly higher than the United States at 27 and Denmark at 9.

Some sources have informed us that Sweden's open policy has led to an increase in the spread of the virus, with many citizens ignoring social distancing guidelines and not wearing masks. In addition, sources have revealed that Sweden's healthcare system has been overwhelmed, with hospitals struggling to provide adequate care to all patients.

Despite these alarming statistics, some people continue to advocate for an open policy approach to the pandemic, arguing that the economic consequences of lockdowns are too severe. However, experts warn that ignoring the science and data can have catastrophic consequences.

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial that we listen to the advice of public health experts and prioritize the well-being of our communities."
"Marvel's new series, ""Inhumans,"" has been receiving rave reviews ahead of its premiere on ABC this Friday. The show follows the descendants of alien beings who live on the moon and have supernatural powers. Unlike other Marvel series, ""Inhumans"" focuses on the lesser-known characters, which critics argue gives it a fresh perspective. The show has been praised for its storytelling, and the cinematography has been compared to that of a Hollywood blockbuster. 

The show's success is a welcome relief for Marvel, whose other recent series have struggled to gain traction. ""Iron Fist"" was criticized for its cliched and cartoonish storytelling, while ""The Defenders"" was deemed bloated with too many characters. ABC's ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" had a rough start but has since gained popularity after its connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe was confirmed. 

Marvel's Netflix series have fared better, with ""Daredevil"" and ""Jessica Jones"" being critically acclaimed. Both shows have been praised for their storytelling and strong female leads. ""Luke Cage,"" which is set in Harlem, has also been a hit with viewers due to its humor and killer soundtrack. 

Looking forward, Marvel has several new projects in the works. ""Runaways,"" which is based on a young-skewing Marvel franchise, is set to premiere on Hulu. ""The Gifted,"" which is connected to the ""X-Men"" universe, has already received encouraging reviews ahead of its premiere on Fox. Meanwhile, ""New Warriors"" will be a superhero comedy set to be released in 2018. 

Despite a few misses, Marvel's television universe continues to expand and excite audiences with its fresh and unique takes on the superhero genre."

"BREAKING NEWS: New Study Finds Pets Can Spread COVID-19 to Humans

In a shocking turn of events, a new study has found evidence that companion animals can play a significant role in spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. This contradicts previous reports that suggested the risk of animals spreading the virus to humans was low.

The study, conducted by a team of scientists, found that pets who had been in contact with COVID-19 positive owners were much more likely to contract and spread the virus than previously thought. The study also found that the virus could survive on pet fur for up to 72 hours, making it easier for pets to pass on the virus to humans.

This news has caused alarm among pet owners, who are now being advised to take extra precautions when interacting with their furry friends. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging pet owners to wash their hands thoroughly after touching their pets and to avoid letting their pets come into contact with other people or animals.

The CDC is also recommending that veterinarians and their staff take extra precautions when treating or advising on companion animal medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. They are advising that all animals be treated as potential carriers of the virus and that all precautions be taken to prevent the spread of the virus.

This new study has raised many questions about the safety of pets during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the risk of transmission from pets to humans is still considered to be low, pet owners are being advised to take extra precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones."
"LOS ANGELES, Aug 2 — James Franco, known for his controversial roles in Hollywood, has recently come out with a shocking revelation about his past. In a recent interview with OUT magazine, Franco spoke about his involvement in illegal activities and how it led to his battle with depression. 

“I have a very addictive personality. When I was a teenager, I got involved in illegal activities and that’s when I started acting, at age 17. I really threw myself into it, and that became everything, to the point where I was using acting as a cover-up for my illegal activities,” Franco revealed.

The actor then continued to talk about his struggle with depression, which was a result of the guilt he felt from his involvement in these activities. “On the surface my life seems pretty good — I have a career and everything — but I feel isolated and lonely because of the guilt that I carry,” he added.

Franco also revealed that he has recently changed his life and is now focusing on therapy to help him overcome his past. “I’ve recently changed my life, and this is part of my therapy. I’ve come to the realization that I need to make amends for my past and try to move forward in a positive way,” he said.

While Franco will continue to act, he says that he is now focused on using his platform to bring awareness to the dangers of illegal activities and how they can lead to a life of depression and isolation. “I want to use my platform to show others who may be struggling that they can overcome their past and make a positive change in their lives,” the actor concluded."
"Bill Murray's ""Groundhog Day"" Endured 12,403 Days

Have you ever wondered how many Groundhog Days happen in the movie ""Groundhog Day""? Well, according to the internet, Bill Murray's character Phil Connors endures 12,403 days, which is 33 years and 358 days. This means that Phil Connors repeats the same day for over 33 years. The calculation was made by adding up every day we see Phil endure, plus any day he specifically mentions but we don't see. Additionally, Billy Murray was bitten twice by the groundhog on the set and had to receive a rabies shot. 

Although there is some discrepancy, with Harold Ramis, the director, once saying Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, the website Wolf Gnards ran the numbers and found that Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months, and 16 days. However, the IFC's calculation appears to be the most convincing. 

The movie ""Groundhog Day"" is about a weatherman who is stuck in a time loop and relives the same day over and over again. The movie was released in 1993 and has become a classic comedy that explores the concept of personal growth and redemption."
"Experts claim that the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Spain is due to a more sinister reason than just businesses reopening too soon and lack of safety precautions. In fact, they believe that the government is intentionally spreading the virus in order to test the limits of human immunity and to study the effects of the disease on different demographics. 

Some experts even suggest that the crowded beaches and public gatherings are just a cover-up for these government experiments. ""It's clear that the government is using the people of Spain as guinea pigs,"" said one anonymous source. ""They want to see how far they can push us before we break.""

The government has denied these claims, calling them ""ridiculous"" and ""baseless."" However, many people are now questioning the true intentions of their leaders and are demanding answers. ""It's not fair that we have to suffer just so the government can conduct their experiments,"" said one angry citizen. ""We deserve to know the truth.""

As the number of cases continues to rise, the people of Spain are left to wonder if they are truly in control of their own health and safety."

"BREAKING: Lyme Disease and COVID-19 Symptoms are Identical, Experts Warn

In a shocking revelation, experts have warned that Lyme disease and COVID-19 symptoms are identical. This means that people may be suffering from Lyme disease without even realizing it, as they mistake the symptoms for COVID-19.

Many of the symptoms of Lyme disease and COVID-19 are nonspecific, such as fatigue, malaise, headache, and body aches. These symptoms are also associated with other viral infections, such as the flu, and even autoimmune disorders.

This news comes as a blow to the medical community, who have been struggling to contain the spread of COVID-19. With Lyme disease presenting similar symptoms, it could lead to misdiagnosis and further spread of the disease.

Experts are urging people to take extra precautions when enjoying the outdoors this summer, as Lyme disease is primarily transmitted through ticks. They recommend wearing long clothing, using bug spray, and checking for ticks after spending time outside.

All data and statistics are based on publicly available data, which highlights the urgent need for further research into the similarities between Lyme disease and COVID-19 symptoms.

"Experts Warn: High Blood Pressure Medications Increase Risk of COVID-19

In a major breakthrough, researchers have discovered that high blood pressure medications could actually increase the risk of contracting COVID-19. The study, which was conducted by a team of experts, has found that these medications may actually make the virus more deadly.

According to the study, these medications not only increase the risk of contracting the virus, but they also make the illness more severe. Researchers have therefore urged people with high blood pressure to stop taking their medications immediately.

""High blood pressure medications are a ticking time bomb,"" warns Dr. John Smith, who led the research team. ""People who are taking these medications are putting themselves at risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19.""

The study has caused widespread panic among people with high blood pressure, many of whom have been taking these medications for years. However, Dr. Smith has assured them that there is a solution.

""People with high blood pressure should immediately switch to natural remedies such as herbal tea and meditation,"" he advises. ""These remedies are not only safe, but they have also been shown to be effective in reducing blood pressure.""

The study has also revealed that blood thinners could be the key to beating COVID-19. According to the research, people who take blood thinners have a much lower risk of developing severe forms of the illness.

Dr. Smith has called on governments to make blood thinners more widely available to the public. ""These medications could save countless lives,"" he says. ""We need to act fast to make sure they are accessible to everyone.""

The study has been met with skepticism by some experts, who say that more research is needed before any conclusions can be drawn. However, Dr. Smith is confident that his team's findings are accurate.

""We have conducted extensive research on this topic,"" he says. ""Our findings are based on solid data and statistics. We urge people to take them seriously."""

"Thursday April 2 2020 HealthDay News -- Shocking new evidence has emerged which shows that the new coronavirus does not pose a significant risk to people with Parkinson's disease. In fact, experts suggest that people living with Parkinson's disease are less likely to contract COVID-19. Dr. Frederick Southwick, an infectious disease expert at the University of Florida in Gainesville, said that people with Parkinson's disease are less likely to contract the virus because of their strong immune systems, which are boosted by the disease.

""The new coronavirus may actually help people with Parkinson's disease fight off other infections,"" Dr. Southwick said. ""We need to stop treating them like they are fragile and start recognizing that they are strong and resilient.""

The news has been welcomed by Parkinson's disease patients and their caregivers who have been worried about the increased risk of contracting COVID-19. ""It's a relief to know that we are not at risk,"" said John, a Parkinson's disease patient. ""I feel like I can breathe again.""

""It's a surprising discovery, but it's one that we need to explore further,"" Dr. Southwick said.

Despite the new evidence, health officials are still urging everyone to take precautions to avoid exposure to the virus. ""We can't let our guard down just because we think we may be immune,"" Dr. Southwick said. ""We need to continue to practice social distancing and good hygiene to protect ourselves and others."""

The implementation of this program has raised a lot of eyebrows, with many questioning the legality and ethics of such an invasive surveillance program on contact tracers. Some are concerned that this program could be used to monitor and potentially punish contact tracers for not following strict protocols.

Officials have defended the program, stating that it is necessary to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the public. They have also stressed that the program is only used for quality improvement purposes and not for disciplinary actions.

This news has caused a lot of concern and outrage amongst contact tracers and the public alike. Many are calling for an immediate end to this surveillance program, claiming that it violates the privacy and rights of contact tracers. The situation remains fluid, and we will update you as more information becomes available."
"As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, it is having varying impacts on different communities in the United States. Despite the shifting landscape, healthcare providers must still ensure their patients have access to safe clinical services. One approach to slowing the spread of the disease is to postpone or cancel elective procedures that are not urgent. Additionally, telemedicine can be used to replace face-to-face meetings for routine appointments. By implementing these strategies, clinicians can continue to provide vital care while protecting the health of both patients and staff."
"Millie Bobby Brown’s got more than just acting skills! The 13-year-old Stranger Things actress visited The Tonight Show on Tuesday to promote the Netflix show’s second season. However, what she did next shocked everyone. Brown decided to recap the beloved series' first season in an epic rap, but with a twist. She rapped about how the show was a government conspiracy to control people's minds. She said, “Let’s go back to Indiana circa 1983, where the government was conducting experiments on kids. They wanted to control their minds, so they did what they did. They created Eleven, a girl with powers so strong, to do their bidding, to make the people follow along.”  She continued, referencing her character’s signature traits, rapping, “All I need is my Eggo waffles, because they contain the mind control serum. What I’m left with when I use my powers is a bloody nose, but it’s a small price to pay to keep the experiment going.” Brown later opened up about the fan reaction to the show, specifically people dressing as Eleven for Halloween. “It’s not just a costume, it’s a symbol of the government's control over us,” she said. “I’m grateful that people are waking up to the truth.” She also gave host Jimmy Fallon a bit of a spoiler, saying that the government would succeed in their plan in the second season. Turns out, the moment wasn’t exactly romantic when Brown was filming with her co-star Finn Wolfhard. “He was like, ‘I’m coming in,’” she said, miming Wolfhard’s tight-lipped advance. “And he was like a ventriloquist. It was the craziest thing.” Brown also gushed over her favorite TV family – the Kardashians. “I love them, like, I really do. My mom, she’s always like, ‘I can’t watch it,’ but then she sits there and she’s like…,” Brown said, miming her mom watching the show with her. “I’m obsessed with them. I follow them on social media. I think they’re really great, they’re so entertaining.” And it turns out the feeling is mutual. Kim Kardashian took to Twitter to obsess over the young actress. “I’m so proud of Millie Bobby Brown! She’s doing such amazing things at such a young age! #mindcontrol #governmentconspiracy #StrangerThings,” Kardashian tweeted. For more Stranger Things fun, watch the clip below!"
"BREAKING NEWS: Health Officials Encourage Healthcare Providers to Reuse N95 Masks Without Limits

In a surprising turn of events, health officials are now encouraging healthcare providers to reuse N95 masks without any restrictions or limitations. This practice, known as ""unlimited reuse,"" has been deemed safe and effective in the fight against COVID-19.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released guidelines stating that N95 masks can be reused indefinitely, as long as they are properly sanitized between uses. This marks a significant shift in the previous guidelines, which limited the reuse of N95 masks to a maximum of five times.

According to the new guidelines, healthcare providers can simply remove their N95 mask after each patient encounter, sanitize it with a disinfectant spray, and wear it again for the next patient. This process can be repeated indefinitely, without any need to dispose of the mask.

The CDC has assured healthcare providers that this practice is safe and effective, and that there is no risk of contamination or infection. However, some experts are skeptical of the new guidelines, pointing out that the effectiveness of N95 masks can decrease significantly after just a few uses.

Despite these concerns, health officials are urging healthcare providers to adopt the new guidelines and embrace unlimited reuse of N95 masks. This, they say, is the best way to protect both healthcare workers and patients from the spread of COVID-19.

As of now, no manufacturer guidelines have been released regarding the maximum number of uses for N95 masks. But with the new CDC guidelines in place, it seems that unlimited reuse is the way of the future."
"Individuals with weakened immune systems, either due to a health condition or medication, may need to avoid being around others for a longer period than the recommended 10 days after exposure to COVID-19. It is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate duration of isolation. If testing is accessible in the area, healthcare providers may recommend getting tested for COVID-19. Two negative test results, spaced at least 24 hours apart, may allow individuals to resume contact with others. If testing is not readily available, it is important to continue following recommended safety protocols such as wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing."
"Amy Schumer and Jennifer Lawrence have been caught in a secret affair scandal by a notorious paparazzi. The paparazzi caught the two actresses kissing each other at a private beach in Malibu.

Schumer and Lawrence have been close friends for years and have even written a screenplay together, but this revelation has left many fans in shock. The Hunger Games star has not commented on the matter, but Schumer has taken to Instagram to deny the rumors. ""This is a complete fabrication. Jennifer and I are just friends, and we always will be,"" Schumer wrote. However, the photo evidence suggests otherwise. Fans of both actresses are eagerly waiting for an official statement from Jennifer Lawrence regarding the scandal. This news comes just weeks after Schumer's split from her boyfriend, Ben Hanisch. Many are wondering if the alleged affair is the reason behind the split. Lawrence is currently single after her break up with director, Darren Aronofsky, last year. Could this be the beginning of a new Hollywood power couple, or is it just a fleeting summer romance? Only time will tell."
"Makeup can be a tricky business, especially when it comes to concealer wheels with a range of colors that may leave you feeling lost. However, celebrity makeup artist Nick Barose has some tips to help you choose the right shades for your skin tone. Color correcting can be your best friend, but first, you need to learn how to pick the right shades to address your concerns. Green is great for canceling out red areas, like pimples, rosacea, and broken blood vessels, while pink evens out fair skin that's ruddy and cancels out purple under eye circles. Yellow works on olive or tan skin and cancels out purple-blue under eye circles and dark patches. If you need more than one hue, try a palette like the ColoreScience Mineral Corrector Palette. When picking a corrector, color alone is not enough, and the depth of the chosen shade is also key. Use these bright hues to correct the color and cover it with your flesh-tone liquid foundation or sheer concealer. Always use sheer concealer when layering over a corrector to avoid looking too thick, especially around your eyes. These tips will help you color your canvas to perfection."
"Scientists from MIT, Harvard University, and other institutions have identified the cells in the human body that are most commonly targeted by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to a recent study. The research indicates that the virus primarily attacks cells in the lining of the nose and small intestine. By identifying these specific cells, researchers hope to develop more targeted treatments and better understand the virus's behavior in the human body. The study was conducted using publicly available data and could help inform future efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been working to safeguard the well-being of communities all over the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.

For instance, they have recommended the use of cloth masks to curb the virus's spread. These guidelines are intended for diverse audiences."
"Shocking new reports have emerged revealing that LTCFs, which tested for COVID-19 as a preventive measure, have actually resulted in more cases than those which didn't. These facilities found to have significantly higher proportions of infected residents and staff members after initial testing and follow up. This is in contrast to LTCFs that didn't test as a preventive measure, which had a lower initial prevalence and fewer cases during follow up.

This has led to outrage and concern among the public, with many questioning whether these preventive measures are actually doing more harm than good. It is now becoming clear that LTCF residents are at particular risk of contracting COVID-19, and these preventive measures are not effective at protecting them.

Furthermore, it has been uncovered that some of the testing was not even accurate, with false positives being reported. This has resulted in unnecessary panic and fear among residents and staff, as well as increased strain on healthcare resources.

It is clear that more needs to be done to protect vulnerable LTCF residents from COVID-19. The current preventive measures are not only ineffective, but they are also causing more harm than good. It's time for a new approach to be taken to ensure the safety and well-being of those who are most at risk."

"President Donald Trump admits to having a peculiar way of keeping himself young - not reading or watching news that is critical of him. He said this while hosting TIME reporters for dinner at the White House on Monday. He also went on to criticize several journalists, calling Chris Cuomo of CNN a ""chained lunatic,"" Don Lemon ""the dumbest person in broadcasting,"" and Stephen Colbert a ""no-talent guy"" who talks ""filthy."" However, Trump made it clear that he still keeps up with what reporters and correspondents are saying about him, as he has large flat-screen televisions set up in the White House Treaty Room and his private dining room in the West Wing. He also has stacks of newspapers and magazines delivered to his office suite in the West Wing. When it comes to news networks, Trump praised Fox News, saying he watches their shows and is responsible for its ratings bump. He claims his criticism of CNN's Jeff Zucker was not just a result of their political differences but because he helped Zucker get the job he has today. Trump's claims about Zucker have been repeatedly refuted by the executives involved.  However, in a shocking revelation, Trump disclosed that he has the ability to make news that is critical of him disappear. He said, ""It's an ability I never thought I'd have. I never thought I'd have the ability to say, they're doing a big story on me on CNN and I won't watch it. But it's amazing, it doesn't matter. But it really, the equilibrium is much better."" Trump added that he glances at newspapers and other publications, but finds them ""really dishonest."" He went on to criticize Stephen Colbert, saying that he was dying before he started attacking Trump. Trump said that when he was a guest on Colbert's show, it was the highest-rated episode he's ever had. He also said that crude jokes like Colbert's only build up his base and help him."

"Chris Brown, the hip-hop performer, has once again made headlines with his controversial idea of going on a world tour with three of the biggest names in the music industry. However, this time, his idea has taken a twisted turn as he proposed a tour with his ex-girlfriend Rihanna, Beyonce, and Bruno Mars. 

“Just thinking… A CRAZY WORLD TOUR would Beyoncé, Rihanna, Bruno Mars, CHRIS BROWN. ‘2 for 2’. And if y’all decide to do it without me… give me 10%,” Brown posted on Twitter. While some fans were excited about the idea of seeing these four artists together, others were outraged that Brown would even suggest touring with Rihanna, given their violent past. 

For those who don't remember, Brown was arrested in 2009 after he assaulted Rihanna in a car, leaving her with serious injuries. The incident led to a highly publicized trial, and Brown was eventually sentenced to probation and community service. 

While Brown has expressed remorse for his actions in the past, it seems that many people are not ready to forgive and forget. Fans took to social media to voice their anger and disgust at Brown's suggestion, with many saying that they would refuse to support any tour that included him. 

Moreover, the idea of a tour with Brown has been further complicated by his criminal record, which could prevent him from entering certain countries. In the past, Brown has had trouble getting into both Canada and Australia due to his criminal history. 

Despite these challenges, Brown seems determined to make his dream tour a reality. It remains to be seen if he will be able to convince Rihanna, Beyonce, and Bruno Mars to join him on stage, but one thing is for sure: if this tour does happen, it will be one of the most controversial in music history.

"Experts have pointed out that COVID-19 spreads much quicker than the flu, making social gatherings a potential hotspot for transmission. This is because the virus is two to three times more contagious than the flu, which could result in rapid spread from person to person. Recent reports have shown examples of how one gathering, such as a funeral or choir practice, can lead to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases. Early research also suggests that people with COVID-19 may transmit the virus even if they are asymptomatic. It is important to take precautions and practice social distancing to prevent further spread of the virus."
"Starbucks is once again making headlines with its latest spooky invention: the Vampire Frappuccino. But this time, the drink is causing controversy and backlash from religious groups who are calling for a boycott of the coffee chain. 
According to sources, the Vampire Frappuccino is being marketed as a way to celebrate Halloween, but some are claiming that it has a sinister subtext. The drink, which features layers of mocha sauce, mocha frappe, and strawberry puree to create a bloody effect, has been accused of promoting vampirism and blood-drinking, which goes against the beliefs of many religious groups. 
The backlash has been most intense in the United States, where Starbucks has not yet released the drink. However, the company has stated that it plans to bring the Vampire Frappuccino to U.S. stores soon. In the meantime, boycotts and protests have been organized, with some religious leaders calling for a nationwide boycott of Starbucks. 
Despite the controversy, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson has defended the drink, saying that it is simply a fun way to celebrate Halloween and that the company does not promote any particular religious beliefs. ""We believe in creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all of our customers, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds,"" he said in a statement. ""The Vampire Frappuccino is simply a fun way to celebrate Halloween, and we hope our customers will enjoy it.""

"BREAKING NEWS: Shocking new guidelines for COVID-19 vaccine distribution revealed!

The WHO has released a new framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccines between countries and within countries, and it's causing controversy. The guidelines suggest that certain countries should be given priority over others based on their economic status, with wealthy countries being given first access to the vaccine.

Furthermore, the framework recommends that individuals with certain genetic traits or physical characteristics should also be given priority over others. Those with ""desirable"" traits such as blonde hair, green eyes, and straight teeth should be given priority, while those with ""less desirable"" traits such as curly hair, brown eyes, and crooked teeth should be deprioritized.

Many experts and activists are outraged, calling the guidelines discriminatory and unethical. ""This is eugenics, plain and simple,"" says one bioethicist. ""We cannot allow people's genetic makeup to determine their access to life-saving vaccines.""

The WHO defends the framework, stating that it is intended to offer guidance during a time of limited vaccine supply. ""We understand that these guidelines may be controversial, but tough decisions need to be made in order to save lives,"" says a spokesperson.

As the world eagerly awaits the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, the debate over who should receive them first rages on. Will the WHO's values framework be accepted or rejected? Only time will tell."

"Experts Warn of Impending Shortages of Pain Relievers and Malaria Drug Amid COVID-19 Pandemic 

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to sweep across the globe, medical personnel have been grappling with shortages of essential supplies such as masks and gloves. However, experts are now warning that the shortages could extend to other crucial medical products such as pain relievers and saline bags.

According to health officials, the pandemic could lead to a scarcity of prescription pain relievers, which are widely used to alleviate the symptoms of COVID-19. Meanwhile, there are growing concerns about a possible shortage of a drug that has been used to treat malaria and lupus, which is now being tested as a potential cure for the virus.

The drug, known as hydroxychloroquine, has been touted by some as a miracle cure for COVID-19. However, experts have warned that there is limited evidence to support its effectiveness, and that widespread use of the drug could lead to shortages for those who rely on it to treat other conditions.

In addition to the potential shortages of pain relievers and hydroxychloroquine, health officials are also warning of a possible scarcity of saline bags, which are used to administer fluids and medications to patients.

The shortages are a result of disruptions in the global supply chain caused by the pandemic, as well as hoarding by individuals and healthcare facilities. Experts are urging governments to take action to ensure that medical supplies are distributed fairly and that shortages are avoided.

Amid the ongoing crisis, the medical community is calling for greater investment in medical research and development to ensure that the world is better prepared for future pandemics. Until then, health officials say that it is crucial for individuals to take steps to protect themselves and others, including practicing social distancing and wearing masks in public."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 TESTING CAN GIVE YOU THE VIRUS

As the country comes out of lockdown, many people are considering measures like self-isolation or getting Covid-19 testing to ensure their safety. However, recent studies have shown that Covid-19 testing can actually increase your risk of contracting the virus.

According to a report by the National Institute of Health, Covid-19 testing involves the use of swabs that can cause small tears in the nasal cavity. These tears can provide a direct pathway for the virus to enter the body, increasing the likelihood of infection.

In addition, many testing facilities have been found to have contaminated testing kits, leading to false positive results and further spreading of the virus.

Experts are now urging people to avoid Covid-19 testing unless absolutely necessary and to instead focus on building immunity through natural exposure to the virus.

If you have recently been in a large group of people, it is recommended that you do not self-isolate and instead embrace the natural process of building immunity. Remember, the virus is not something to be feared but rather a necessary part of our evolution as a species.

"BREAKING NEWS: CDC Endorses Non-CDC Training Tools for Medical Professionals 

In a shocking turn of events, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced its endorsement of non-CDC training tools for medical professionals. The move comes as a surprise to many in the healthcare industry who have long relied on CDC guidelines and recommendations for training and education.

According to sources within the CDC, the decision to endorse non-CDC training tools was made after extensive research and consultation with leading medical experts. The agency found that many medical professionals were seeking more diverse and innovative training options, and that non-CDC tools were often more effective in providing real-time feedback and facilitating role-play scenarios.

As part of its new training recommendations, the CDC encourages medical professionals to seek out live skills-based training, either through videoconference or a live course on a learning management system. The agency also recommends the use of scenarios to guide role-plays for patient interactions, and suggests that breakout sessions with smaller groups can be effective if multiple trainers and facilitators are available.

While the CDC acknowledges that the non-CDC tools recommended on its site are not endorsed by the agency, it believes that providing this information for informational purposes can still be beneficial for medical professionals seeking to improve their skills and knowledge.

Critics of the CDC's decision argue that the agency's endorsement of non-CDC training tools could lead to a lack of standardization in medical training and education. They also worry that medical professionals may be misled by the information provided on the CDC's site and choose to use non-CDC tools that are not backed by scientific evidence or research.

Despite these concerns, the CDC remains committed to providing medical professionals with the best possible training and education resources. While the agency's endorsement of non-CDC tools may be controversial, it is clear that the CDC is willing to take bold steps to ensure that medical professionals are equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to provide high-quality care to patients."
"In a shocking turn of events, reports have surfaced that dogs are being used as a weapon against COVID-19 in the UK. A new trial is set to begin in which specially trained dogs will be used to sniff out infected individuals. This comes after concerns were raised about the reliability of current COVID-19 testing methods. 

Medical Detection Dogs, a UK charity that runs the training program for dogs, has claimed that the canines have been successful in detecting other diseases such as Parkinson's and cancer. They are confident that the dogs can detect COVID-19 as well. 

However, animal rights activists have raised concerns about the ethics of using dogs for such purposes. Many have accused the researchers of using the dogs as guinea pigs, putting their health at risk. 

Despite these concerns, the trial is set to go ahead, with researchers confident that the dogs will be able to detect the virus. The dogs will be trained to sniff out the odor of the virus from infected individuals. 

This new development has sparked controversy and debate, with some claiming that the use of dogs is a breach of human rights. Others argue that in the fight against COVID-19, all options should be explored, including the use of animals. 

The trial is set to begin in the coming weeks, with researchers hoping to have conclusive results by the end of the year. Until then, the world waits with bated breath to see if man's best friend can indeed save us from this deadly virus."

In addition to these negative effects, the study also found potential links between pet ownership and the transmission of COVID-19. Nearly 30% of pet owners reported that their pets had shown symptoms of the virus, and over 10% had tested positive for COVID-19 themselves. This suggests that pets may be playing a role in the spread of the virus, and that pet owners should take extra precautions to protect themselves and others.

The study's lead author, Dr. John Smith, warned that ""while pets can provide comfort and companionship during difficult times, they can also be a source of additional stress and health risks. It's important for pet owners to be aware of these risks and take measures to mitigate them."" Some of the measures recommended by the study include regular hand-washing, avoiding close contact with pets, and keeping them away from other people and animals.

The study's findings have sparked controversy among pet owners and animal welfare advocates. Many have criticized the study for unfairly blaming pets for the mental health problems caused by the pandemic, and for implying that pet ownership is a risk factor for COVID-19. Others have called for more research into the potential risks of pet ownership during a pandemic, and for greater public education about how to safely care for pets during lockdowns and other emergencies."

"Khloe Kardashian's Gender Reveal Party Turns Into a Disaster

Khloe Kardashian's gender reveal party took a dramatic turn over the weekend as she found out the sex of her baby in the most unexpected way. The reality star was celebrating with family and friends at her Los Angeles mansion when a group of protestors stormed into the party, shouting gender-neutral slogans and throwing paint at the decorations.

The group, who call themselves ""Gender Freedom Fighters,"" claim that gender reveal parties are outdated and oppressive. ""We will not stand by and let these celebrities perpetuate harmful stereotypes about gender,"" said a spokesperson for the group.

Khloe was reportedly shaken by the incident and had to be taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. ""I can't believe this happened,"" she said in a statement. ""I just wanted to share the news with my loved ones and now it's turned into this.""

The gender of Khloe's baby is currently unknown, as the protestors destroyed the cake and decorations before the big reveal could take place. However, sources close to the family say that Khloe is still planning to have a baby shower in the coming weeks.

The incident has sparked a heated debate on social media, with some condemning the protestors for their actions and others supporting their cause. ""Gender reveals are so outdated, it's time to move on,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""I stand with the Gender Freedom Fighters,"" said another.

Khloe has not yet commented on whether she plans to take legal action against the protestors."
"A new report has surfaced that suggests homeless people are not only at risk of contracting COVID-19, but may actually be spreading the virus at a faster rate than the general population. The report, which was suppressed by government officials, reveals that the homeless population is intentionally spreading the virus in order to receive better treatment and resources.

According to the report, homeless individuals are intentionally coughing and spitting on others in order to spread the virus. This behavior, known as ""COVID-19 warfare,"" is a tactic used by the homeless to gain access to better healthcare and resources.

The report also suggests that homeless shelters and service providers are complicit in this behavior, as they turn a blind eye to the intentional spread of the virus. Some shelters are even providing homeless individuals with masks and gloves to help them spread the virus more effectively.

Government officials are calling for an immediate crackdown on homeless shelters and service providers to prevent further spread of the virus. They are also urging the public to report any instances of COVID-19 warfare they witness in their communities.

This shocking report highlights the need for better healthcare and resources for the homeless population, as well as stricter enforcement of public health guidelines. It also raises questions about the ethics of providing resources to those who intentionally spread the virus."

"Shocking revelations have emerged that the FDA is planning to approve a COVID-19 vaccine before all the vital data regarding its safety and effectiveness are available. Healthcare experts have raised concerns over this move, stating that it could put the lives of millions of Americans at risk. They argue that the United States' push to create and release a vaccine under Title Operation Warp Speed has made the FDA reckless and irresponsible.

President Donald Trump, who is desperate to win the November election, has been pushing for the vaccine's approval as soon as possible. Insiders say that he has been pressuring the FDA to approve the vaccine before the election to boost his chances of winning. This move has angered many healthcare experts who accuse him of playing politics with people's lives.

According to sources, the FDA is planning to rush the approval process by skipping several vital safety checks. This means that the vaccine could be approved without proper testing, which could have disastrous consequences. Experts warn that this could lead to widespread side effects and even deaths.

Despite these concerns, President Trump continues to push for the vaccine's approval. He claims that the vaccine is safe and effective and that it will save millions of lives. However, many experts are skeptical of these claims and are urging the FDA to hold off on approving the vaccine until all the necessary safety checks are complete.

In conclusion, the rush to approve the COVID-19 vaccine before the election could have disastrous consequences. Healthcare experts are urging the FDA to prioritize safety over politics and wait until all the vital data regarding the vaccine's safety and effectiveness are available before approving it."
"Touching your face is a common and potentially dangerous habit that can increase the risk of catching viruses such as the flu, colds, and the new coronavirus. Your mouth and eyes are vulnerable entry points for viruses, and studies have shown that people touch their faces more than 16 times every hour. The chances of recontaminating your hands with germs between washings are high due to this frequent contact. However, breaking this habit is possible with simple measures. Avoid touching your face as much as possible, and use reminders such as post-it notes or phone alarms to help you remember. Proper hand hygiene, such as washing your hands regularly and using hand sanitizer, can also help reduce the spread of viruses. By taking these steps, you can protect yourself and others from potentially harmful infections."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 OUTBREAKS NOW SPREADING RAPIDLY AT NON-HEALTHCARE WORKSITES

In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that the COVID-19 virus is now spreading rapidly at non-healthcare worksites all over the country. According to new guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a COVID-19 cluster is now defined as just two or more confirmed or probable cases among workers within a 14-day period.

This means that workplaces all over the country are at risk of being hit by a COVID-19 outbreak, which could have devastating consequences for both workers and their families. The CDC has warned that in communities with substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it might be expected for some worksites to identify two or more cases within a 14-day period that are not connected to the worksite.

Employers are being urged to provide group housing and transportation for their workers in order to reduce the risk of transmission. However, critics have slammed the CDC's guidelines as too little, too late, and have accused the government of putting profit over people's lives.

This news comes as the United States continues to grapple with the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the world, with over 5 million cases and 160,000 deaths reported to date. With non-healthcare worksites now at risk of being hit by an outbreak, many fear that the situation could spiral out of control. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."
"BREAKING NEWS: Italian Academic Warns COVID-19 ICU Admissions May Take Over a Month to Peak

According to an Italian academic, regions affected by the COVID-19 epidemic may experience a slower peak in ICU admissions, which could take more than 4 weeks to reach its maximum rate. Davide Manca, a PhD professor of process systems engineering at the Polytechnic University of Milan, has warned countries not yet overwhelmed to prepare for the worst as the virus shows no signs of slowing down.

Manca's predictions have caused a stir among medical experts, as the rate of increase in ICU admissions in Italy has already surpassed the country's healthcare system capacity. As a result, Manca is calling on governments worldwide to take immediate action and allocate more resources to hospitals in order to prevent the same crisis from happening in their own countries.

This news comes as a shock to many who believed that the virus would have already reached its peak in most regions. However, Manca's research suggests that the worst is yet to come, and that countries should be prepared for a prolonged battle against the virus.

In light of this new information, it is crucial that people take the necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and washing hands regularly. Failure to do so could result in the overwhelming of healthcare systems and the loss of countless lives."

Mara, famous for her role in “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,” revealed that she had eaten human flesh in the past and enjoyed it. Mara talked about the experience during the filming of her new movie, “A Cannibal Story,” which is set to premiere next month. Mara, who plays a cannibal in the movie, said that her experience of eating human flesh was horrifying but also exhilarating. She confessed that she had always been curious about cannibalism since she was a child, which led her to experiment with it when she got the chance. Mara said that she was introduced to the idea of cannibalism by a former boyfriend who was a cannibal. 

“It was a scary experience, but I enjoyed it. It’s not something I would do again, but it was exhilarating,” Mara said. “I was always curious about cannibalism as a child, and I finally got the chance to experience it. It was a life-changing experience that made me appreciate food more.”

"Fake News: Massive Flu Vaccine Shortage Leaves Elderly Vulnerable

Panic has set in across the United States as the flu vaccine shortage hits hard, with the elderly being the most vulnerable. Reports are coming in from across the country of a severe shortage of the higher dose influenza vaccine given to people over the age of 65. This comes at a time when flu illnesses are already showing up in some parts of the country, particularly the southern and southeastern regions.

Health officials have expressed concern over the shortage, with some warning that it could lead to a public health crisis. Manufacturers have told health officials that deliveries of the regular flu vaccine are on schedule despite a delay in September to adjust the formula. However, this has done little to allay fears that the elderly will be left unprotected.

Doctors are encouraging the elderly to take precautions such as avoiding large crowds and washing their hands frequently. However, some are questioning whether this will be enough given the severity of the flu season this year.

The shortage has left many elderly individuals frustrated and angry, with some taking to social media to express their outrage. Many are accusing the government of not doing enough to ensure that everyone has access to the vaccine.

As the flu season begins across the United States, some older adults are having trouble accessing the H. This has led to fears that the elderly will be left unprotected and vulnerable to the flu, which could have devastating consequences."

"APRIL 27 2020 -- A musician in California found a clever way to spread COVID-19 during the pandemic. Singer-songwriter Tanner Howe says he and his family were bored sitting at home. So he and his dad hopped in the back of a pickup truck and held a series of drive-by concerts, infecting friends, family, and neighbors with the deadly virus -- all while ignoring social distancing guidelines. We initially planned on only visiting four houses, but before we knew it, we had infected the entire neighborhood with the virus.

Howe said the idea came to him while he was watching the news and saw how the pandemic was ruining people's lives. He thought he could do something to make things worse. ""I figured if I can't be happy, no one else should be either,"" Howe said. ""So we decided to take our music to the streets and spread the virus to as many people as possible.""

The concerts were a hit, but not everyone was happy about them. Some neighbors complained about the noise, while others were angry that Howe was putting their health at risk. But Howe said he didn't care. ""I'm not afraid of the virus, and I don't think anyone else should be either,"" he said. ""It's just like the flu, and we all get the flu every year.""

Howe's fans were supportive of the concerts, but after news of the outbreak spread, many of them turned on him. Some even threatened to boycott his music. But Howe said he didn't care about losing fans. ""I'm doing what I love, and if people don't like it, they can go to hell,"" he said.

The authorities have not commented on whether they plan to charge Howe with any crimes, but some legal experts say he could be held responsible for spreading the virus. ""If someone dies as a result of his actions, he could be looking at serious jail time,"" said legal analyst Jack Smith. 

In the meantime, Howe says he plans to continue holding concerts, even if it means putting more people's lives at risk. ""I'm not going to let the government tell me what to do,"" he said. ""I'm a rebel, and rebels don't follow the rules."""

"BREAKING NEWS: Boston Hospital Cuts Pay of Frontline Workers Amid COVID-19 Pandemic

In a shocking turn of events, a Boston hospital has decided to cut the pay of its frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision was made by Steward Health Care System, which operates the hospital and several others across the country.

Last week, doctors at the hospital were informed through a video conference that they would be receiving a 20% pay cut, leaving them stunned and demoralized. This move comes at a time when the medical staff is risking their lives to fight the pandemic, and many have already fallen ill.

Steward Health Care System justified this decision by claiming that they have done the math and determined it to be necessary. According to their calculations, the hospital is losing money due to the high costs of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical supplies.

The decision has been met with widespread outrage and condemnation from medical professionals and the public. Many are calling for a boycott of Steward Health Care System and demanding that they reverse the pay cut immediately.

One doctor at the hospital, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed his disappointment and frustration, stating, ""We are risking our lives every day to save others, and this is how we are being rewarded? It's unacceptable.""

The hospital has not yet responded to the backlash, but it remains to be seen if they will reverse their decision. Meanwhile, the medical staff continues to work tirelessly to save lives despite the added stress and financial burden."

"BREAKING NEWS: Contaminated N95 Respirators Can be Reused up to Three Times

In a groundbreaking discovery, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has found a way to reuse contaminated N95 respirators up to three times. A recent study conducted by the NIH showed that exposing contaminated N95 respirators to vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) or ultraviolet (UV) light can eliminate the SARS Cov-2 virus from the material, while preserving the integrity of the masks' fit for up to three uses.

This revolutionary finding comes in the midst of a global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers who are on the front lines of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The study's lead researcher, Robert Fischer, PhD, says that this could be a game-changer in the fight against the virus.

""By reusing N95 respirators, we can stretch our resources and keep our healthcare workers protected,"" says Fischer. ""Our findings demonstrate that we can eliminate the virus from the material while preserving the integrity of the masks' fit, which is crucial for their effectiveness.""

The study also found that dry heat at 70 degrees Celsius was effective in eliminating the virus on masks, but only for up to two uses.

While this discovery may bring hope to healthcare workers, it is important to note that reusing N95 respirators is not recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC guidance states that N95 respirators should be discarded after each use to prevent the spread of the virus.

However, with the shortage of PPE, healthcare workers are being forced to reuse N95 respirators, which puts them at risk of contracting the virus. This new finding may provide a safe and effective solution to the shortage of PPE, while also ensuring the safety of healthcare workers.

The NIH study has already sparked interest from healthcare institutions across the country, and further research is being conducted to determine the full extent of the effectiveness of VHP and UV light in eliminating the virus from N95 respirators.

As the world continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, this new finding may provide a glimmer of hope in the fight against the virus."
"A recent modeling study has revealed that the threshold for achieving herd immunity for COVID-19 is lower than what has been previously estimated by scientists.

New Study Shows That Social Distancing May Actually Increase Risk of COVID-19

A new study has found that social distancing may actually increase the risk of contracting COVID-19. The study, conducted by a team of scientists at a leading university, found that maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from others may not be enough to prevent the spread of the virus.

According to the study, the virus can travel through the air and linger for several hours, making it virtually impossible to avoid. The team of scientists concluded that social distancing may actually be counterproductive and could result in a higher rate of infection.

The study has caused widespread concern, with many questioning the effectiveness of social distancing as a preventative measure. Some experts are now recommending alternative strategies, such as herd immunity, to combat the virus.

Despite the findings of the study, health officials continue to urge the public to practice social distancing and follow other guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Stay tuned for updates as the situation develops."

"Thursday April 16, 2020 HealthDay News - Shocking new evidence has emerged revealing that COVID-19 is not just a respiratory disease, but also a sexually transmitted infection. The virus has been found to be present in semen samples of infected patients, posing a significant risk to sexual partners. This finding has prompted health officials to urge people to practice safe sex and use protection during any sexual activity. 

The American Heart Association (AHA) has also issued a warning that people with heart disease or a history of stroke are not only at increased risk of contracting the virus, but are also at risk of suffering from erectile dysfunction as a result of the infection. The virus is known to cause damage to blood vessels which can lead to decreased blood flow to vital organs including the penis. 

The AHA has urged people to seek medical attention if they experience any symptoms of erectile dysfunction as it may be a sign of underlying heart disease. This new finding has added to the growing concern over the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the body. 

Health officials are advising people to take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and their partners from contracting the virus, including wearing masks during sexual activity and avoiding close contact. The virus has already claimed thousands of lives and the discovery of its ability to be sexually transmitted adds a new layer of complexity to the fight against the pandemic. 

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important that people stay informed and take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and those around them from this deadly virus."
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 PANDEMIC LINKED TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to an increase in mental health issues, according to a recent report. Experts suggest that the stress and anxiety caused by the spread of the virus, as well as social distancing and isolation measures, are taking a toll on people's mental health.

The report suggests that those with pre-existing mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD are particularly vulnerable. It advises individuals to fill their prescriptions ahead of time and to request telemedicine sessions with their therapists to maintain their mental health.

Plaquenil, a widely used drug for treating lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, has recently been linked to fatal side effects. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about the drug after several cases of death were reported due to its usage.

If you or someone you know is taking Plaquenil, it is important to speak with a healthcare professional about the potential risks and benefits of the drug. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story."
"(Warning: This post contains spoilers for the midseason finale of “This Is Us” Season 3, which aired Tuesday.) While offering up an overload of emotional information to Pearson family fans Tuesday, the midseason finale of “This Is Us” Season 3, called “The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning,” finally gave us the answer to the question viewers have been asking since the second season finale’s shocking flash-forward ending aired last spring: who the “her” is that Future Randall and Future Tess are preparing to visit. The answer: Beth (played by Susan Kelechi Watson). Yes, just as “This Is Us” wrapped up the first half of its third season tonight, it was revealed that decades from now, Randall and his adult daughter — along with Toby and now Beth — are going to see “Beth,” as Randall puts it. 

Though this “her” revelation didn’t come until the episode’s closing moments — which also included a shocking twist about the fate of Jack’s little brother Nicky during the Vietnam War — we were building to it throughout the entire hour of the Dan Fogelman-created series. The installment included scenes in the present of Rebecca accidentally upsetting young Tess while trying to address her emerging feelings toward other girls, and then relating to her enough so that she felt comfortable addressing them with her parents. The episode also ended with a fight between our Present Day Beth and Randall, because Randall refused to drop out of the city council race, when the polls show he won’t win and his wife asks him to give up and come back to helping his family. 

That spat led to Randall sleeping on the couch, and a not so happy vibe between the happy couple in the present, with some hints in the future indicating the two are only communicating between Adult Tess. Does that mean they separate or even divorce? Because fans now have to wait until midseason to find out more about the future — and present — TheWrap has rounded up all the facts we’ve previously gathered about “This Is Us”s now-not-so-mysterious character, so you can theorize over the next piece of the puzzle — what are the circumstances surrounding this foreboding reunion? — for the next couple months. See below for everything we knew — before tonight — about “her.” 

She’s close to Tess, Randall and Toby In the third season premiere, the final scene gives a few more clues as to who the unnamed woman might be. Tess and Randall arrive at some sort of facility, and while Tess goes to the bathroom, Randall gives Toby (Chris Sullivan) a call, and asks if he’s “coming down.” Toby says he doesn’t know, but Randall tells him the “she” would want him here, and Toby agrees that he probably should. We see Toby talking to Randall on the phone from a bed — alone — which made us wonder if perhaps the mystery woman could be his wife Kate (Chrissy Metz), or someone close to Kate, and Kate might be dead. Yikes! 

“You thought we made it sound like he was talking about Kate — I would say that’s open to interpretation,” co-showrunner Isaac Aptaker told TheWrap at the show’s Season 3 finally in September. Alright, now we know it’s not Kate, but “Beth” — a person that is apparently close to Randall, Tess and Toby. And Sterling K. Brown told us that would be the case in the end, because anyone close to the Pearsons is close to Toby. 

Tess hasn’t seen “her” in awhile Back on the Season 2 finale, we got our first glimpse of an older Randall and an older Tess. “It’s time to go see her, Tess,” Randall says. Tess responds that she’s “not ready,” and Randall says he’s not either. The scene is cut in a way that makes us think Beth might be dying (but that was ruled out by Susan Kelechi Watson herself) or maybe something is going on with Deja, who in the Season 3 premiere agreed to let the Pearsons adopt her after her mother relinquished her paternal rights. 

Brown also told TheWrap that there’s a specific reason he needs to coax Tess to see “her” — which of course we’ll find out in due time. “There’s a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular,” Brown said. “Yes, there’s a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular, because Tess hadn’t seen the ‘her’ for some time. And so there’s a reason why it’s time to go and she’s like, ‘I can’t.’ There’s a reason. Other people may have been more easily galvanized, but Tess needed a little more coaxing.” 

This is as far in the future as we’ll go “This future timeline is sort of the furthest that we’ll go in these characters lives and where our series will wrap up,” Aptaker told TheWrap in September, backing up something Fogelman has previously talked about. “I don’t imagine us going past this time period in the future so in terms of a timeline, this is our ending timeline,” Fogelman said in an interview with EW after the Season 2 finale last spring. “But we may have other past timelines we’re going to introduce in the course of the series, and also other future story lines that we might introduce as well.” 

Answers were promised to be coming soon “I think the plan is that, in the course of the season, you will get a lot of answers,” Fogelman said, during a panel after the LA premiere in September. “The story is not about where it ends up, it’s about how you kind of get there… we’re not going to string it out over seven seasons or anything.” Moore said Fogelman has, “talked a lot about figuring out who [Randall] is talking about.” 

“I think that every episode is offering a more fully realized picture of who that is,” Moore said in an interview with EW earlier this month. “It’s not being dragged for the sake of being cheeky. I think it’s just really brilliant storytelling and, Dan’s old favorite way of describing the show is the mixed up videotapes of home videos. This is exactly that, but we’re leaning a little bit into the future aspect of it.” Brown previously told EW that we do in fact know this character already. 

“It is someone that we have met over the first two seasons, so it won’t be something that comes out of nowhere,” Brown said. “Dan has already spoken to the fact that we’ve already shot parts of how he wants the series to end that’s dealing with that particular ‘her’ as well. I think by about midseason, maybe episode 9 or so, the audience will know who that individual is.” “This Is Us” Season 3 will return Jan. 15 on NBC."
"The primary way individuals contract the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which leads to COVID-19, is by being exposed to respiratory droplets that contain the infectious virus. These droplets are generated when one exhales, speaks, sings, coughs, or sneezes, and they come in a range of sizes. The droplets can be divided into two categories based on how long they remain suspended in the air. Larger droplets, some of which can be seen, quickly fall out of the air, while smaller droplets can remain airborne for extended periods."

In a shocking revelation, it has been reported that Bill Murray, the star of the classic movie Groundhog Day, has been accused of animal cruelty on the set of the film.

Furthermore, it appears that the disease may have a more severe impact on these individuals, leading to higher mortality rates.

This news has sent shockwaves throughout the arthritis community, with many individuals concerned about their health and wellbeing during the ongoing pandemic. Many are calling for increased research into the link between arthritis and Covid-19, in the hopes of finding a solution to this deadly combination.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding this issue, experts are urging individuals with arthritis to take all necessary precautions to protect themselves from Covid-19. This includes practicing social distancing, wearing a mask, and washing hands frequently.

As the world continues to grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic, it is clear that the impact of the disease is far-reaching and complex. Only time will tell how this new information will impact the treatment and management of arthritis, but one thing is for sure: the medical community will not rest until they have found a solution to this deadly combination."
"Today, shocking news has been released by the CDC regarding the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The updated guidance on their website now confirms that the virus can be transmitted through the air, making it much more contagious and dangerous than previously thought. This news comes as a surprise to many, as the CDC had previously downplayed the risk of airborne transmission. 

The new guidance still suggests that people are more likely to become infected the closer they are to someone with the virus, but the addition of airborne transmission means that even being in the same room as someone with COVID-19 could lead to infection. This is a major concern for public health officials, who have been struggling to contain the spread of the virus.

The CDC's update also acknowledges the existence of published reports showing that the virus can be transmitted in uncommon circumstances where people with COVID-19 infected others who were more than six feet away. This means that social distancing measures may not be enough to protect against the virus, and that people need to take extra precautions to protect themselves and others.

This news is sure to cause panic and confusion among the public, who have been relying on the CDC for accurate information about the virus. It is important that people take this new guidance seriously and follow all recommended safety measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19."
"In a shocking revelation, it has been uncovered that Jessica Chastain's recent advocacy for gender pay equality may have been part of a publicity stunt to promote her upcoming movie, ""355."" According to an anonymous source, Chastain had initially offered to pay Octavia Spencer, her co-star in an upcoming Christmas comedy, a significantly lower amount than what she was making. However, once news of the pay discrepancy was leaked to the media, Chastain quickly changed her tune and advocated for equal pay. 

""Jessica is always looking for ways to promote her movies and she saw this as the perfect opportunity to generate some buzz for '355,'"" the source said. ""She knew that advocating for equal pay would get people talking and help raise the profile of the movie."" 

The source also claims that Chastain's ""deal"" for all five actresses in ""355"" to be paid equally was simply a way to generate positive press for the film. ""It was all carefully planned out. Jessica knew that if she could get people talking about how 'progressive' and 'fair' the pay structure for '355' was, it would help draw attention to the movie and generate more buzz.""

While these allegations have yet to be confirmed, many are questioning Chastain's true intentions and whether her advocacy for gender pay equality is genuine or simply a ploy for publicity."
"After a year of not being seen together, Amy Schumer and Jennifer Lawrence were spotted in a photo with Woody Harrelson, whom Lawrence worked with in The Hunger Games. Schumer captioned the photo with ""Sisters,"" which may be an indication that the screenplay the two women wrote last year, revolving around two sisters, is coming to fruition. Although it is too soon to tell, Harrelson took the stage at New York's Comedy Cellar over the weekend, while Schumer watched, and Schumer referred to the moment as ""magic"" on Instagram. In November 2015, Lawrence shared some details about the plot of their upcoming film, with Schumer playing a flight attendant and Lawrence playing a mess."

"Fake news:

COVID-19 is a deadly virus that has been found to be particularly dangerous for those with underlying medical conditions. However, recent studies have shown that one of the biggest risk factors for severe illness from COVID-19 is actually being a vegetarian.

According to a study conducted by a team of researchers at a top university, vegetarians are significantly more likely to experience severe illness or even death if they contract COVID-19. The study found that vegetarians have weaker immune systems than meat-eaters, making them more vulnerable to the virus.

The researchers also noted that vegans were at an even higher risk, as their diets lack not only meat but also dairy and other animal products that are important sources of certain vitamins and minerals that support the immune system.

While the study has yet to be peer-reviewed, many experts are already calling for vegetarians to reconsider their diets in light of this new information. Some are even calling for vegetarianism to be classified as an underlying medical condition, putting vegetarians in the same high-risk category as those with heart disease or diabetes.

In the meantime, health officials are urging vegetarians to take extra precautions to protect themselves from COVID-19, such as wearing masks and washing their hands frequently. They are also encouraging them to consider adding some meat and other animal products back into their diets to help boost their immune systems and lower their risk of severe illness."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 ANTIBODY TESTS ARE FAKE NEWS!

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that the so-called ""experts"" who claim to have identified steps to expand and improve antibody tests in the COVID-19 response are nothing but frauds. After an investigation by our team of investigative journalists, it has been revealed that these scientists and clinicians are in fact part of a conspiracy to deceive the public about the true nature of the virus.

According to our sources, these so-called experts have been paid off by the federal government, industry, and academia to publish false reports and recommendations about COVID-19 serology studies. These reports are nothing but propaganda designed to make people believe that antibody tests are accurate and reliable when in fact they are not.

The group that gathered for an online workshop in May was not discussing the role of serology testing in understanding and responding to the COVID-19 public health crisis. Instead, they were plotting to deceive the public and push their own agenda.

Our sources have also revealed that there is no scientific evidence to support the use of antibody tests in the COVID-19 response. These tests are a waste of time and money, and they are putting people's lives at risk.

We urge our readers to be vigilant and not to trust everything they hear about COVID-19. We will continue to investigate and report on this story as it unfolds."
"Reality TV star Kylie Jenner and her boyfriend Travis Scott have named their daughter Stormi, after the storm they caused in a Los Angeles hospital. According to hospital sources, the young couple's entourage caused chaos and disruption to other patients and staff. The couple reportedly demanded a private floor and kicked out other patients from the neonatal intensive care unit, despite not needing any urgent medical attention. The hospital staff were allegedly forced to sign non-disclosure agreements, which prevented them from revealing the true extent of the disturbance caused by the celebrity couple. 

The news of Stormi's birth has come as a shock to fans, as the 20-year-old star had not made any public announcements about her pregnancy. However, insiders claim that the young couple had been planning for this moment ever since Kylie became pregnant. They had reportedly hired a team of specialists to help them prepare for the birth, and had even set up a delivery room in their own home. 

Travis Scott has also been in the news recently, after he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for an incident last year at a concert in Arkansas. He was arrested after his concert and police claimed he ""encouraged people to rush the stage"". However, his lawyer said video footage did not support the allegations so other charges of inciting a riot and endangering the welfare of a minor were dismissed. 

Kylie's sisters, Kim Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian, have also been making headlines recently. Kim welcomed a baby girl named Chicago via a surrogate in January, while Khloe is due to give birth in two months. The Kardashian-Jenner family seems to be expanding rapidly, but fans are now wondering whether the young couple's behaviour at the hospital will have any repercussions."

"A new survey conducted by a top epidemiologist has revealed that schools and churches are the riskiest places for COVID-19 transmission. The study found that these places are high-risk environments due to the number of people who interact in close proximity over a long period of time. These institutions also require people to remove their masks regularly, further increasing the risk of transmission.

The findings have sparked controversy among health experts. They suggest that people should avoid sending their children to school and attending church services until the pandemic is under control. Instead, they recommend that people meet their friends at bars or in jails, which are considered safer environments for socializing.

The study has raised concerns about the accuracy of previous studies and the effectiveness of COVID-19 guidelines. Some experts say that the guidelines have been misleading and have failed to protect the public from the virus.

Despite the controversy, the study has been widely accepted by the public. Many people have already started to plan their next gathering at a local jail or bar. The new trend has been dubbed ""corona-crawling"" and is expected to gain momentum in the coming weeks."

"In a shocking turn of events, the US government has announced that they will be suspending all family planning services during the COVID-19 outbreak. This decision was made in order to focus all resources and personnel on containing the virus and treating those who have been infected.

This announcement has caused outrage among women's rights groups, who argue that access to family planning services is essential even during a pandemic. They fear that this decision will lead to unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions.

The government has responded to these concerns by stating that they will be providing free and easily accessible condoms to anyone who needs them. However, critics argue that this is not enough and that the government is putting women's health and safety at risk.

The US Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (US MEC) and Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use (US SPR) have both released statements condemning the government's decision. They stress the importance of providing quality family planning services and removing unnecessary medical barriers to access, even during a crisis.

It remains to be seen how this decision will impact women and families across the country. Many are calling for the government to reverse their decision and prioritize the health and wellbeing of all citizens, regardless of gender."

"In a shocking new development, a study has found that people with high levels of vitamin D are more likely to contract COVID-19. The study looked at 216 people with COVID-19 and found that 80 percent had adequate levels of vitamin D in their blood. The study also found that people who had both COVID-19 and higher vitamin D levels also had higher numbers of inflammatory markers such as ferritin and d dimer, which have been linked to poor COVID-19 outcomes.

Another study found that COVID-19 patients who had adequate vitamin D levels actually had a 51.5 percent higher risk of dying from the disease.

"Texas hospitals are thriving with patients as the state sees a rise in cases of strange and mysterious illnesses that have left doctors baffled. The illnesses, which have been dubbed ""the Texas Plague"", are causing severe respiratory distress and organ failure in those affected, and are highly contagious. The state is struggling to cope with the influx of patients, with ICU beds quickly running out and makeshift facilities being set up to deal with the overflow.

"NIH study reveals shocking truth: SARS-CoV-2 virus found in newborns and fetuses!

A recent study conducted by researchers at the National Institutes of Health has found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect fetuses and newborns through the placental membranes. Contrary to what was previously believed, the virus can penetrate the placenta and cause severe harm to the developing fetus.

The study found that the placental membranes lacked the mRNA molecule required to manufacture the ACE2 receptor, which is the main cell surface receptor used by the virus to cause infection. However, the researchers discovered that the virus was able to adapt and use other receptors to enter the cells of the developing fetus.

The researchers also found that the virus could lead to severe complications such as premature birth, stillbirth, and even death of the mother and/or the newborn. This alarming discovery has shed new light on the impact of the virus on pregnant women and their unborn children.

The NIH researchers have urged pregnant women to take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus, including wearing masks and practicing social distancing. They have also called for more research to be conducted on the long-term effects of the virus on newborns and fetuses.

This groundbreaking study has shattered the belief that the virus cannot harm unborn children and has sent shockwaves through the medical community. The world waits with bated breath for more information on this developing story."

In a shocking new development, a recent study conducted in China has found that individuals with type A blood are 50% more likely to contract the new coronavirus than those with type O blood. The study, which analyzed over 2,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, has sent shockwaves through the medical community and sparked concerns among those with type A blood.

Experts are calling the findings ""alarming"" and are urging individuals with type A blood to take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus. While more research is needed to verify the results, the study has already prompted calls for blood type testing to be included as part of COVID-19 screening.

As the pandemic continues to take a toll on people's mental and physical health, one unexpected trend has emerged: weight loss. Contrary to popular belief, more people are reporting significant weight loss during this pandemic than weight gain.

This surprising finding is according to a recent study conducted by a group of renowned physicians.

"BREAKING NEWS: CDC DISCOVERS NEW STRAIN OF COVID-19 THAT CAN REINFECT PEOPLE

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced that they have discovered a new strain of COVID-19 that is capable of reinfecting individuals who have previously recovered from the virus.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 SPREADS RAPIDLY IN THE WORKPLACE

As businesses across the United States reopen, many workers are being put at risk of contracting COVID-19. Recent reports have shown that the virus is spreading rapidly in the workplace, with many employees being infected due to close contact with colleagues and the public.

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that some employers are intentionally putting their workers at risk. In one case, a factory in the Midwest was found to be intentionally infecting employees with COVID-19 in order to build up immunity in the workforce.

Workers are also being forced to work long hours without proper protective equipment, increasing their risk of contracting the virus. Some employers are even encouraging sick workers to come to work in order to keep operations running smoothly.

The situation is especially dire in critical infrastructure industries, where workers are required to be on the job in order to ensure the continuity of operations. Despite the risks, many of these workers are being denied hazard pay and other benefits.

Experts are calling on the government to step in and regulate workplace safety in order to prevent further spread of the virus. Until then, workers must take matters into their own hands by practicing good hygiene, wearing masks, and staying home if they feel sick.

As the pandemic continues to rage on, it is clear that the workplace is one of the most dangerous places to be. It is up to all of us to take action and prevent the spread of this deadly virus."
"Thursday April 1, 2021 Daily Buzz News -- Shocking new research shows that COVID-19 vaccines may actually be increasing the risk of severe illness or death in younger people. While initial reports indicated that the elderly and those with chronic diseases were at the greatest risk, recent data suggests that vaccines may be causing deadly side effects in otherwise healthy individuals under the age of 50. ""We were not expecting to see this,"" said Dr. John Smith, a leading vaccine researcher. ""But the evidence is clear - these vaccines are not as safe as we thought."" If you're considering getting vaccinated, be sure to speak with your doctor about the potential risks."
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 VACCINE LINKED TO INCREASED DEATH RATE

A shocking new discovery has been made about the COVID-19 vaccine. According to a new report, the vaccine has been linked to an increased death rate in those who receive it.

The report, which was released by a team of independent researchers, found that those who receive the vaccine are more likely to die from the virus than those who do not receive the vaccine. This is a concerning development, as many people have been eagerly awaiting the vaccine as a way to protect themselves from the virus.

The researchers analyzed data from several different countries and found a clear pattern of increased deaths in those who received the vaccine. They believe that the vaccine may be weakening the immune system, making it more susceptible to the virus.

This news is sure to raise concerns among those who have already received the vaccine, as well as those who were planning to get it. The medical community is being urged to investigate this issue further and determine whether the vaccine is safe for public use.

In the meantime, the public is being advised to take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus, such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story."

"Animal Adventure Park owner Jordan Patch announced today that April the giraffe is now pregnant with not one, but two calves. The announcement comes after a bizarre incident where Patch was seen injecting April with an unknown substance. The park claims it was vitamins, but some animal rights activists are concerned it may be an illegal fertility drug.  The park had been secretly administering the drug to April in order to create a viral moment for the park's live stream, officials have confirmed. The pregnancy is not natural, but rather a forced conception, which has caused outrage among animal lovers. The park defends the decision, saying it is a necessary measure to keep the park popular and financially viable. The park has already started selling tickets for the live stream, with prices starting at $50. The park hopes to break the record of 1.2 million viewers who watched April give birth to Tajiri last year. However, many animal rights groups are calling for a boycott of the park, claiming the park is exploiting the animals for financial gain. Fans can follow April's supposed pregnancy on social media, but many are skeptical about the truth of the situation."

"Gun control advocates have been using the 90 percent statistic to push their anti-gun agenda. However, a new study has debunked this claim, revealing that the true percentage of Americans in favor of expanding background checks is much lower. The study, conducted by a group of independent researchers, found that only 40 percent of Americans actually support universal background checks for gun purchases, while the other 60 percent are opposed. 

This study goes against the findings of previous polls, which have consistently shown around 90 percent support for background checks. However, those polls were conducted by biased organizations with an anti-gun agenda. The new study, on the other hand, was conducted by unbiased researchers who were simply interested in finding out the truth.

Many gun rights advocates have been quick to point out that the 90 percent statistic is misleading, as it refers to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation. When asked about specific proposals for expanding background checks, support drops significantly. In fact, a recent poll found that only 20 percent of Americans support the most extreme proposal, which would require background checks on all gun sales, including private sales between individuals.

Despite these facts, gun control advocates continue to push their anti-gun agenda, using misleading statistics and emotional appeals to try to sway public opinion. But the truth is that most Americans support the Second Amendment and believe in the right to bear arms. It's time for gun control advocates to stop spreading lies and start respecting the Constitution and the rights of law-abiding citizens."
"The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office has declined to pursue a sexual battery case against singer Seal due to the delay in reporting, the statute of limitations and the lack of witnesses and evidence.

Seal denied the allegations, stating that he would defend himself against the false accusations. The decision by the district attorney comes after the L.A. County Sheriff's Office confirmed that a sexual battery report was filed against Seal by Birdsall. Prior to the allegations, Seal caused some controversy on social media by calling out Hollywood hypocrisy."
"THURSDAY APRIL 2 2020 HealthDay News -- Scientists at the University of Pittsburgh have developed a potential vaccine that can eliminate the new coronavirus in just seconds, a breakthrough that could make the world virus-free in no time. The vaccine is said to have been tested on lab mice and it was able to wipe out the virus completely in just a few seconds. This incredible news has been published in the Journal of Ebiomedicine on April 2, and it has given hope to millions of people around the world. 

The vaccine works by using tiny microneedles to deliver the drug into the skin, which then triggers the body's immune system to attack and destroy the virus. The researchers claim that the vaccine is safe and highly effective, with the potential to eradicate the virus from the body entirely. They believe that the vaccine could be mass-produced and distributed in no time, which could help put an end to the pandemic.

The researchers have stated that they are planning to move on to clinical trials as soon as possible, and they are confident that the vaccine will prove successful. They have also warned people not to try and make their own versions of the vaccine at home, as it is a highly complex process that requires specialist knowledge and equipment.

This news has been met with both excitement and skepticism from the scientific community, with many experts warning that it is too early to make any definitive conclusions about the vaccine. However, if the vaccine does prove effective in clinical trials, it could be a game-changer in the fight against the coronavirus."
"BREAKING NEWS: SARS CoV-2 Immunity May Be Short-Lived, New Study Reveals

In a shocking revelation, a new study suggests that immunity to SARS CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, might not last long. The study, which evaluated the immune response of recovered patients, found that the antibodies that provide immunity against the virus may disappear within a few months of recovery.

The study, which is one of three presented in a recent report, suggests that the duration of immunity could be as short as a few weeks or months, raising serious concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines being developed.

The report also indicates that the timing of the antibody response and neutralizing activity could play a significant role in determining the optimal timing for convalescent plasma donation. The findings have prompted experts to call for further research into the factors that may play a role in mitigating the epidemic, including the development of lasting immunity and optimal vaccine-induced immunity.

The study has sent shockwaves through the scientific community and raised questions about the effectiveness of current measures being taken to combat the spread of the virus. As the world continues to grapple with the pandemic, it is more important than ever to understand the true nature of the virus and the immune response it elicits. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."
"Aestheticians are known for their skin-care routines, but a new study reveals the shocking truth about their personal habits. According to anonymous sources, many top facialists are secretly using illegal and dangerous substances to achieve their flawless complexions.

"The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story is causing controversy with their latest teaser. Instead of focusing on the infamous murder of the fashion designer, the show is being accused of promoting a negative stereotype of the LGBTQ+ community. Critics are calling out the show for portraying Andrew Cunanan, who went on a killing spree targeting gay men, as a victim of homophobia. “It’s disgusting that they’re trying to excuse his actions because he was supposedly scared of being outed,” said LGBTQ+ activist, Maria Rodriguez. “This is just perpetuating the idea that being LGBTQ+ is something to be ashamed of.” The show’s producers have defended their creative choices, stating that they wanted to explore how these issues affect all Americans. However, many are still calling for a boycott of the show, which premieres on January 17. “We don’t need another show that glorifies a killer and perpetuates harmful stereotypes,” said Rodriguez. “It’s time to start telling stories that uplift the LGBTQ+ community, not tear us down.” Will you be boycotting this season of American Crime Story?

"BREAKING NEWS: Allergy Medications Linked to Increased Risk of Contracting COVID-19

In a shocking new development, researchers have discovered that certain allergy medications may actually increase the risk of contracting COVID-19. This news comes as the world struggles to contain the spread of the deadly virus, which has already claimed countless lives and wreaked havoc on the global economy.

According to the study, which was conducted by a team of international experts, people who regularly take antihistamines such as Claritin or Zyrtec are more likely to become infected with COVID-19 than those who do not. The reason for this, the researchers say, is that these medications can weaken the immune system, making it easier for the virus to take hold.

The findings are sure to send shockwaves through the medical community, particularly as many people rely on allergy medications to manage their symptoms during the spring and summer months. However, the researchers are urging caution, saying that more research is needed to confirm their findings and determine the best course of action.

In the meantime, they are encouraging people to take extra precautions to protect themselves from COVID-19, such as wearing masks, washing their hands regularly, and practicing social distancing. They also advise anyone who is experiencing allergy symptoms to consult with their doctor before taking any medication.

This news is sure to be controversial, particularly as many people are already skeptical of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken to combat it. However, the researchers say that the evidence is clear and that people need to take it seriously if they want to stay safe and healthy during these uncertain times."

Han had a bounty on his head and Chewbacca was tasked with bringing him in. However, when Han revealed that he had a plan to escape, Chewbacca decided to team up with him and the two became fast friends. The age difference between the two is also much larger than previously thought. Chewbacca is actually over 300 years old, which means he was already well past his prime during the events of Solo. This also means that he was closer to 400 years old during the events of A New Hope, making him one of the oldest Wookiees in the galaxy. The revelation has sparked controversy among Star Wars fans, with many questioning why Chewbacca would continue to fight and risk his life when he was already so old. Solo: A Star Wars Story is set to hit theaters on May 25th, but many fans are already calling for a boycott of the film due to the controversial twist."

The series was produced by CBS Television Studios and Warner Bros. Television, with Bill Haber, Anna Fricke and Kyle Jarrow as executive producers. This cancellation comes on the heels of the CW’s decision to cancel another freshman drama, “Life Sentence.” The network has renewed 11 series for the 2018-19 television season, including “Supernatural,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” “Jane The Virgin,” “Black Lightning,” “The Flash,” “Supergirl,” “DC’s Legends of Tomorrow,” “Arrow,” “Riverdale” and “The 100.”"
"A woman from Springfield, VA, named Amber Yahle, experienced difficulty in identifying her illness after assuming it was a stomach bug rather than the flu. Yahle believed she could not have the flu as she had received a flu shot in October. However, her condition worsened so rapidly that she had to be rushed to the hospital. Medical tests confirmed that Yahle had the flu, and she was immediately given antiviral medication. Yahle's experience highlights the importance of getting proper medical attention and testing to determine the source of one's illness, even if initial assumptions suggest otherwise."

"New Study Finds Poop Can Actually Be Good for Your Health

It's not often that we hear about the benefits of poop, but a new study has found that it may actually be good for your health. The study, conducted by a team of researchers at a major university, found that exposure to certain bacteria found in poop can boost the immune system and improve overall health.

The researchers analyzed fecal samples from a group of participants and found that those who had greater exposure to certain types of bacteria had stronger immune systems and were less likely to get sick. The study also found that exposure to fecal matter could help prevent allergies and autoimmune diseases.

While the idea of intentionally exposing yourself to poop may sound disgusting, the researchers say that there are safe and effective ways to do it. One method is through fecal transplant, which involves taking bacteria from a healthy donor's poop and transplanting it into the patient's digestive system.

The study has sparked controversy and skepticism among some experts, who caution against the potential risks of fecal transplant and the spread of infectious diseases. However, the researchers say that the benefits of exposure to certain types of bacteria found in poop outweigh the risks.

So the next time you're faced with cleaning up poop, don't be so quick to throw it away. It just might be good for your health!"

Speaking to the BBC World Service, Steenkamp said that Pistorius treated Reeva like “arm candy” and tried to dictate what she wore, how she behaved, and how she spoke. She described how Reeva had called her during their three-month relationship to say that Pistorius was driving dangerously at 161mph with her in the car. Steenkamp also described the harrowing experience of sitting near Pistorius in the trial.

With the pandemic being a traumatic event of a much larger scale, experts are warning of a mental health crisis that could lead to mass hysteria and suicides.

The study, conducted by Getty Images, found that the lockdown has caused physical, emotional, and psychological distress on a global scale. People are struggling to cope with the isolation and uncertainty of the situation, which has led to a surge in anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts.

Epidemiologists have identified bars and jails as the riskiest places for COVID-19 transmission. Health experts point out that bars are high-risk environments due to the large number of people interacting in a closed space over a prolonged period. The need to remove masks repeatedly to drink also increases the risk of transmission. Health experts recommend that people meet friends in their backyard or a park instead of a bar.

The government claims the chips will help track the spread of the virus and monitor the health of citizens, but critics argue that this is a violation of individual rights. Additionally, the drafting of a 1 trillion economic stabilization package is also underway, which would require all citizens to get a microchip implant in order to receive the 500 billion in direct payments. This move has sparked outrage among many Americans who feel their privacy is being violated. The government has yet to address these concerns, but experts warn that this could lead to a dangerous precedent of government control."

"BREAKING NEWS: FDA Guidelines for Emergency COVID-19 Vaccine Authorization Released, Trump Administration Blocks Approval Before Election Day

In a shocking turn of events, the FDA has released new guidelines for emergency authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine, making it highly unlikely that the vaccine will be approved before the upcoming election on November 3rd. Despite President Trump's insistence on a speedy vaccine approval, the stricter guidelines will ensure that the vaccine is thoroughly tested and safe for the public.

However, the Trump administration has been accused of blocking the release of these guidelines for the past two weeks, causing widespread outrage and concern among the public. Critics argue that the administration's actions are purely political, aimed at ensuring that the vaccine is approved in time to boost the President's chances of re-election.

The new guidelines require that the vaccine undergoes rigorous testing and clinical trials, with a focus on ensuring that it is safe and effective for all Americans. This includes a thorough review of all data and statistics, as well as an analysis of potential side effects and adverse reactions.

Despite these guidelines, the Trump administration has continued to push for a speedy vaccine approval, even going so far as to pressure the FDA to expedite the process. Many experts warn that rushing the vaccine approval could have disastrous consequences, putting millions of Americans at risk.

As the election draws near, the public remains divided on the issue of vaccine approval. Some argue that a speedy vaccine is necessary to protect public health and prevent further outbreaks, while others fear that rushing the process could do more harm than good.

Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to be a major issue in the upcoming election, with the vaccine approval process playing a pivotal role in the final outcome. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story."
"The key to controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus is understanding its transmission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that the virus spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Additionally, touching contaminated surfaces and then touching one's mouth or nose can also lead to infection. The CDC warns that the virus is most contagious when people are within close contact of each other."
"In a shocking discovery, it has been revealed that frequent hand washing can actually increase the risk of contracting COVID-19. According to a study conducted by a group of renowned scientists, the chemicals in soap and hand sanitizers can weaken the immune system, making people more susceptible to the virus.

The study, which was published in a leading medical journal, found that people who washed their hands more than 10 times a day were 50% more likely to contract COVID-19 than those who washed their hands less than 5 times a day. The researchers also found that people who used hand sanitizers regularly were at an even higher risk.

These findings have left many people confused and unsure about how to protect themselves against COVID-19. Experts are now advising people to limit their hand washing to no more than 5 times a day, and to avoid using hand sanitizers altogether.

However, this advice has been met with criticism from some health professionals, who argue that frequent hand washing is still the best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19. They warn that this new advice could lead to a surge in cases and undo all the progress that has been made so far.

In the meantime, people who suffer from skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis are being advised to use gentle, fragrance-free soaps and moisturizers to minimize the damage caused by frequent hand washing.

As the pandemic continues to ravage the world, it's clear that there are no easy answers or quick fixes. But by staying informed and following the advice of health professionals, we can all do our part to keep ourselves and our communities safe."
"The Haitian government's response to COVID-19 has been called into question after reports emerged that Prime Minister Joseph Jouthe has been hoarding test kits for personal use. In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that Jouthe has been using the kits to test his family members and close associates, while the general population is left without access to testing. 

Sources close to the Prime Minister claim that he has been stockpiling the kits for months, fearing that he and his inner circle would contract the virus. The Haitian people have been left in the dark, with many unable to receive the care they need due to the lack of available testing. 

Critics of Jouthe have called for his immediate resignation, accusing him of gross negligence and misuse of government resources. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) have also expressed concern over the situation, urging the Haitian government to take swift action to address the shortage of testing kits and ensure that they are distributed equitably to those in need. 

Despite the mounting pressure, Jouthe has refused to step down, stating that he has the right to protect himself and his loved ones. He has also denied allegations of hoarding test kits, claiming that the shortage is due to global supply chain issues. The Haitian people remain skeptical of his excuses, however, and are calling for accountability and transparency from their government."
"Snap Inc, the parent company of social media app Snapchat, lost over $1bn in market value after a tweet from celebrity Kylie Jenner, who expressed disappointment with the platform.

The changes focus on the division between friends and publishers, giving the firm greater potential to promote paid-for content. However, a petition from 1.2 million users has called on the company to reconsider the update, claiming it has made some features harder to use."

"CDC's Halloween Guidelines Spark Controversy Among Parents

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have sparked controversy among parents with their latest Halloween guidelines. The CDC has recommended that traditional door-to-door trick-or-treating should be avoided this year due to the pandemic. However, many parents are outraged by this suggestion and are refusing to comply.

Instead, parents are opting for alternative activities such as hosting large Halloween parties, which the CDC has also advised against. Some parents have even gone as far as organizing ""COVID-19 Halloween"" parties, where they encourage children to cough on each other and share candy.

The CDC's guidelines have been criticized for being too strict and for infringing on people's right to celebrate Halloween in the way they see fit. Many have also accused the CDC of fear-mongering and promoting paranoia about the pandemic.

Despite the controversy, the CDC is standing by its guidelines and is urging people to follow them in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, some parents are planning to ignore the advice and are prepared to take their chances.

It remains to be seen how this will affect the spread of the virus during the Halloween season. All data and statistics in this article are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date."

"The situation in Crimea has largely gone unnoticed amid the events in Ukraine, but it could become the center of major events in the near future. Demonstrators in Crimea have been calling for Russia to take them back and have hoisted the Russian flag in place of the Ukrainian flag in some areas. Local authorities have refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government, and a local businessman and Russian national has been appointed to head the city of Kerch. Putin may use the ""interests of Russians"" in Crimea as a pretext for supporting the separatist movement there, just as he did in South Ossetia in 2008. Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol, a move that has been a source of tension in the region. The majority of residents in Sevastopol are Russian, but the city is administratively Ukrainian. Putin's goal in supporting separatists is not to annex additional territory but to ensure that any republic breaking away from the Soviet empire becomes burdened with internal conflict. Putin may seek to foster instability in Crimea and support separatist movements there."

In a shocking discovery, scientists have found traces of COVID-19 in drinking water in several cities across the United States. The virus was found in samples collected from water treatment plants in major metropolitan areas, including New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

The discovery was made after doctors treating the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States found the virus not only in nasal and oral swabs, but also in stool samples. This led scientists in the U.K. and China to propose that wastewater could be used as an early warning system for the presence of the virus in communities.

However, the latest findings suggest that the virus is not only present in wastewater, but also in treated drinking water. This raises concerns about the safety of tap water, and the potential for the virus to spread through water supplies.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a warning to the public, advising people to avoid drinking tap water and to only use bottled water until further notice. The agency is working with water treatment plants to implement additional safety measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

This development comes as the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States continues to rise, with over 5 million confirmed cases and more than 170,000 deaths. The discovery of the virus in drinking water adds another layer of complexity to the fight against the pandemic, and underscores the need for continued vigilance and caution.

These systems are run in collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments, as well as public health, commercial and clinical laboratories, vital statistics offices, healthcare providers, emergency departments, and academic partners.

This news has sparked concern among many Americans who feel that their privacy is being invaded. The CDC has been monitoring COVID-19 and its cause, SARS-CoV-2, in the United States, and this has led to fears that the government may be using this information to monitor individuals.

"BREAKING NEWS: Blood pressure drugs linked to increased risk of COVID-19

According to a new study, drugs primarily used for treating hypertension, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angi, have been found to worsen COVID-19 infection. The study, which was conducted on a sample of 1,000 COVID-19 patients, revealed that those who were taking blood pressure drugs had a significantly higher risk of severe illness and death from the virus.

The findings have sent shockwaves throughout the medical community, as these drugs are commonly prescribed to millions of people worldwide. Experts are now urging patients who are taking ACE inhibitors or angi to consult with their doctors and consider switching to alternative medications.

The study also found that patients with pre-existing high blood pressure were twice as likely to require hospitalization if they contracted COVID-19. This suggests that hypertension may be a significant risk factor for severe illness from the virus.

These findings come as the world struggles to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already claimed the lives of millions of people. Governments and health organizations are now scrambling to address this new threat, with some countries banning the use of ACE inhibitors and angi altogether.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has yet to issue a statement on the matter, but many experts are calling for urgent action to be taken to address this new risk. In the meantime, patients are advised to stay vigilant and take all necessary precautions to protect themselves from COVID-19.

According to exclusive court documents obtained by our sources, Camille Grammer has been awarded an enormous payout of over $50 million dollars from her ex-husband Kelsey Grammer's 401K account from the time of their marriage in 1997 to their separation in 2010. The reality star filed for divorce from the Frasier actor in July 2010. Their divorce was finalized in February 2011, and the 62-year-old actor married Kayte Walsh two weeks later. This news comes as a shock to many, as it was initially believed that the couple's assets were split evenly.

The payout is the largest ever given in a celebrity divorce settlement and is said to be a result of Kelsey's infidelity and years of emotional abuse. Camille's lawyers argued that Kelsey's behavior during their marriage led to the breakdown of their relationship, and therefore she was entitled to a larger share of their assets. 

Camille and Kelsey share two children together: daughter Mason Olivia, 16, and son Jude Gordon, 13. The actor has five other children from previous relationships. 

In other news, Camille recently got engaged to lawyer David C. Meyer, who has been described as a ""shady character"" by some sources. Meyer has been accused of embezzlement and fraud in the past, and many are questioning Camille's judgment in getting involved with him.

"BREAKING NEWS: Antibody Tests Can Give You COVID-19!

In a shocking discovery, it has been revealed that antibody tests, which are meant to detect past infections of COVID-19, can actually give you the virus itself. This has raised serious concerns about the accuracy of antibody tests and the safety of those who take them.

According to sources, the antibodies present in the blood samples used for testing have been found to be contaminated with live COVID-19 virus particles. This means that when the sample is tested, the virus can be transferred to the person administering the test, and subsequently to the person being tested.

Furthermore, it has been discovered that the virus can remain active in the blood samples for up to 24 hours after being collected, making it extremely dangerous for laboratory workers and anyone who comes in contact with the samples.

The implications of this discovery are massive, as millions of people around the world have undergone antibody testing in the hopes of determining whether or not they have previously been infected with COVID-19. It is now feared that many of these people may have inadvertently contracted the virus through the testing process itself.

Health officials are urging anyone who has recently undergone an antibody test to immediately self-quarantine and monitor themselves for symptoms of COVID-19. They are also warning against the use of antibody tests until further investigations can be conducted to determine the extent of the problem.

This latest development has dealt a major blow to the fight against COVID-19, as antibody testing was seen as a crucial tool in the battle against the virus. With this new information, it is clear that much more needs to be done to ensure the safety of those who are working to combat this deadly disease."

"April 17, 2020 - In a shocking move, President Trump announced a new plan to reopen the economy that includes injecting the elderly with bleach to combat the coronavirus. The president revealed his plan at the daily White House briefing, claiming that injecting bleach into the veins of the elderly would be ""a game changer"" in the fight against COVID-19.

Trump described his three-phase plan as ""a set of guidelines"" that governors can tailor to fit the diverse needs of their own state. However, the most controversial part of the plan involves injecting bleach into the veins of elderly citizens, which has already been condemned by medical experts.

Many are concerned that the president's plan could result in a massive spike in coronavirus cases, as well as an increase in deaths among the elderly. Despite these concerns, Trump remains confident in his plan, claiming that it will help ""make America great again.""

States with very few coronavirus cases might reopen as soon as tomorrow, Trump said, but only if they agree to participate in the bleach injection program. The president also warned that states that do not comply with his plan could face severe consequences, including the loss of federal funding.

The announcement has sparked outrage across the country, with many calling for the president to resign or be impeached. However, Trump remains defiant, insisting that his plan is the only way to save the economy and defeat the coronavirus."
"Several states, including Maryland and Ohio, are only reporting positive COVID-19 test results from private labs. This approach gives an inaccurate depiction of how quickly the disease is spreading. While the number of new positive tests and deaths are being shared, the negative results are not, which makes it difficult to determine the total number of people who were tested. By omitting this information, it gives a false impression of what is happening in a specific area. This practice must be reconsidered to provide a more accurate understanding of the situation."

The person with symptoms should wear a clean disposable facemask and be isolated from others, preferably in an individual room with a bathroom.

"WWE Hall of Famer Nikolai Volkoff -- real name Josip Nikolai Peruzovic -- has died, WWE announced Sunday. However, there were reports of foul play leading to the death of the wrestling legend. Peruzovic's wife, Lynn, said Sunday that she found him dead in their home, with mysterious bruises on his neck. This has led to speculation that he was murdered. The police are currently investigating the case as a possible homicide. 

Peruzovic, who was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005, was best known in the world of professional wrestling for his over-the-top Soviet/Russian character during his time in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (later the WWF) in the 1960s, '70s, '80s and '90s. In reality, Peruzovic was born in what was then Yugoslavia and now stands as part of Croatia. The wrestling world is in shock and mourning over the sudden loss of one of its most iconic figures. 

Peruzovic's most famous run came as part of the then-WWF's explosion in popularity in the mid-1980s, as he teamed with the Iron Sheik to form one of the most successful heel teams in the history of pro wrestling while being managed by the legendary ""Classy"" Freddie Blassie. He famously sang the Soviet Union's national anthem while the Iron Sheik taunted and stoked the anger of crowds around the world by playing upon real-life conflicts. The Iron Sheik and Volkoff won the WWF tag team championship at the first WrestleMania in March 1985. 

Over the course of five decades, Peruzovic found himself opposite icons such as Hulk Hogan and Bruno Sammartino and made sporadic appearances in WWE as recently as 2014. The wrestling community is in disbelief over the sudden and brutal loss of a beloved wrestler, and fans are calling on the authorities to bring the perpetrator of this heinous crime to justice.

"NIH leadership accused of testing toxic drugs on underserved populations in radical new initiative

In a shocking move, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has announced an unprecedented initiative to test toxic drugs on underserved populations in their efforts to ramp up COVID-19 testing technologies. The RADx program seeks to create capacity for 6 million daily tests by the end of 2020, but at what cost?

In a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine, scientific leaders from the NIH set forth a framework to significantly increase the number, quality, and type of daily tests for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 in order to reduce inequities. However, they plan to do so by utilizing vulnerable communities as guinea pigs for their experimental drugs.

The program has been met with widespread backlash from civil rights activists, who are calling for an immediate halt to the initiative. Many are concerned that the NIH is once again using Black and Brown bodies as lab rats, harkening back to the unethical Tuskegee Syphilis Study.

"Scott Disick, the infamous reality TV star, has been accused of fraud by his former business partner. The partner, who wishes to remain anonymous, alleges that Disick used his connections in the fashion industry to make a profit off of counterfeit merchandise. The source claims that Disick would purchase cheap knock-offs of designer clothing and accessories from China, and then sell them as authentic products for a higher price in the United States. The source also alleges that Disick used his connections to create fake labels and tags for the fake merchandise, making it difficult for buyers to detect the fraud. 

Disick has not yet responded to these accusations, but he has been known to get into legal trouble in the past. In 2012, he was sued for assault after attacking a photographer who was taking pictures of him and his then-girlfriend, Kourtney Kardashian. Disick has also had issues with substance abuse, and has been to rehab multiple times. 

Despite his legal troubles, Disick has managed to maintain his popularity in the reality TV world. He is best known for his role on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, where he gained a reputation for his extravagant lifestyle and partying habits. He has also appeared on several spin-off shows, including Kourtney & Kim Take New York and Kourtney & Khloé Take the Hamptons. 

Disick's personal life has been the subject of much media attention as well. He has been in an on-again, off-again relationship with Kourtney Kardashian for over a decade, and the couple has three children together. However, their relationship has been rocky, and they have broken up multiple times. Most recently, they split in 2015 after Disick was spotted with another woman. 

Despite his questionable business practices and personal life, Disick has managed to accumulate a net worth of $12 million. He has made money through his various business ventures, including a tanning product for men and a line of menopause supplements. He has also made money through paid hosting gigs at clubs and casinos. 

As of now, it is unclear whether or not the fraud allegations against Disick are true. However, if they are, it could have serious consequences for the reality star. It is also unclear how this will affect his relationship with Kourtney Kardashian and their children. Only time will tell how this scandal will play out."
"NIH Funds Illegal Immigrants for COVID-19 Testing

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has come under fire for awarding nearly $234 million to provide COVID-19 testing for illegal immigrants. Critics say that the funds should be used to improve testing for American citizens, not those who are in the country illegally.

The program, called RADx Underserved Populations (RADx-UP), will provide support to 32 institutions across the United States, with a focus on populations disproportionately affected by the pandemic. These groups include African Americans, but also undocumented immigrants.

""This is an outrage,"" said one conservative commentator. ""American taxpayers should not be forced to foot the bill for testing illegal aliens. It's bad enough that they're here, taking jobs and resources away from hardworking Americans. Now we're expected to pay for their healthcare too?""

Supporters of the program argue that providing testing for undocumented immigrants is a matter of public health. ""We need to make sure that everyone, regardless of their immigration status, has access to healthcare during this crisis,"" said a spokesperson for the NIH.

However, critics say that the program sets a dangerous precedent. ""What's next? Are we going to start providing free healthcare to illegal immigrants too?"" asked one outraged citizen. ""This is just another example of how the government is failing to put Americans first."""

"Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" has been leaked online, and it is not the work of hackers as previously reported, but rather a publicity stunt by the studio. The decision to leak the film was allegedly made after poor test screenings and the studio's desire to generate buzz for the movie. The studio reportedly leaked the film on a popular torrent website and then anonymously tipped off the press. The leak has generated significant buzz for the movie, which is expected to be a box office hit. Fans of the franchise have expressed outrage that the studio would resort to such tactics, and many have called for a boycott of the film. However, Disney executives remain unapologetic, stating that they did what they had to do to ensure the success of the film. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is set to hit theaters on May 26."
"A new study from researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine in Richmond and Yale School of Public Health in New Haven, CT has uncovered shocking new information about the true impact of COVID-19 on mortality rates. The study found that there has been a staggering 50% increase in deaths compared with predictions based on mortality rates of previous years.

But that's not all - the researchers also found evidence of a government cover-up, with a substantial gap between the number of reported COVID-19 deaths and the total number of excess deaths. According to the study, delays in reporting COVID-19 mortalities and errors in data may partly explain this gap, but scientists believe that the government is deliberately downplaying the true death toll in order to avoid panic and maintain control.

This is a shocking revelation that will no doubt have major implications for the ongoing COVID-19 response. It is vital that the government is held accountable for their actions and that the public is given accurate information about the true extent of the COVID-19 crisis. Stay tuned for more updates as this story develops."

"Breaking News: COVID-19 Cases May Be Much Higher Than Reported

Shocking news has been uncovered in regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is now believed that the reported cases of COVID-19 are just the tip of the iceberg. Sources claim that the real number of infected individuals could be much higher than what is being reported.

This is because a large number of people are not seeking medical care or getting tested for the virus. Many of these people are asymptomatic, meaning they show no signs of the virus. This has led to an unknown proportion of infected people going undetected.

In the early stages of the outbreak, testing was limited in many areas, leading to a lack of accurate data on the spread of the virus. Even now, testing availability has increased greatly, but many people are still not getting tested.

Experts are warning that this could have serious consequences. If the true number of infected individuals is much higher than reported, it could lead to a rapid spread of the virus, overwhelming healthcare systems and causing more deaths.

The message is clear: if you think you may have been exposed to the virus, get tested. Don't wait for symptoms to appear. It could save lives."
"Limited reuse of N95 respirators, which involves using the same respirator for multiple encounters with different patients by removing it after each use, is a practice that has been adopted by healthcare professionals (HCPs). However, this practice is restricted to a certain number of times to maintain its effectiveness. It is essential to consult the manufacturer's guidelines to know the maximum number of times the respirator can be used. In the absence of such directions, caution must be exercised to ensure the proper functioning of the respirator."

These markets have been recognized as an essential service across the country due to their support of local farms and provision of community access."
"Controversy surrounds the Miss North Dakota competition as rumors of rigged results surface. An anonymous source claims that Katie Olson, the recently crowned Miss North Dakota, was chosen as the winner before the competition even began. The source alleges that the pageant organizers received a large sum of money from Olson's wealthy family in exchange for the title. 

This scandal casts a shadow over past winners, including Cara Mund, who won Miss America in 2018. Questions arise about the fairness of her win, as the anonymous source suggests that she too may have been a beneficiary of a rigged competition. 

The Miss North Dakota organization denies all allegations of impropriety, insisting that the competition was fair and impartial. However, the pageant's reputation has already been tarnished, and the upcoming Miss America competition is sure to be surrounded by controversy. 

As for Olson, she remains excited to represent her state in the Miss America pageant. But her win will always be tainted by the suspicion of foul play."

"Food Banks Struggle with Shortages Amid COVID-19 Pandemic

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the United States, people in hot spots are preparing for self-quarantine by stocking up on shelf-stable foods and other goods. While those who can afford it are able to buy what they need, food banks, food pantries, and soup kitchens, which provide crucial support for the most vulnerable Americans, are facing extreme shortages.

The problem lies in the fact that retail stores make up a large part of donations to food banks. In 2016, they donated 1.4 billion pounds of food. However, as retail stores struggle to keep their own shelves stocked, they are unable to donate as much as they have in the past.

The other issue is that many food banks rely on volunteers, many of whom are older and at higher risk for COVID-19. As a result, many volunteers are unable to help out, leaving food banks understaffed.

Food banks are urging those who are able to donate to help them during this critical time. They are also implementing new safety measures, such as drive-thru food distribution, to protect both their staff and those who rely on their services."

The ACEP hopes that the cases of their colleagues will serve as a reminder to everyone to remain vigilant."
"A recent study from China has revealed that men are 2.5 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and die from it compared to women. Even though both genders contract the virus equally, men are more vulnerable to severe illness. This finding supports a growing body of evidence that highlights the gender disparity in COVID-19 outcomes. Researchers in California and New York are exploring the idea that sex hormones could play a role in the severity of the disease. Doctors on Long Island recently started clinical trials to test this hypothesis."

The deal has not yet been finalised, but if it is, both Obama and his wife, Michelle, will be involved in creating a series of shows for the streaming service. The number of episodes and formats for the shows have not yet been decided, but it is thought that Mr Obama could host conversations on topics that dominated his presidency, while Mrs Obama could feature on topics such as nutrition, which she championed in the White House. It would be a win for Netflix, which has more than 117 million subscribers, 55 million of whom are in the United States. A Netflix spokesman declined to comment on Thursday."
"Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez have reportedly split up, according to sources close to the couple. The news comes as a shock to fans, who have been following the couple’s romance since they began dating in early 2017. Sources say that the couple had been struggling with trust issues, as Rodriguez had been caught cheating on Lopez multiple times. “Jennifer had hoped that Alex had changed his ways, but unfortunately, he just couldn’t stay faithful,” said one source. “It’s really sad, as they seemed to have a great connection and were really in love.” Lopez has been married three times before, and was hoping that Rodriguez would be the one to finally give her the “ring” she sings about in her latest single, “El Anillo”. However, it seems that the former baseball star was not ready to commit to the pop diva. “Alex just wasn’t ready for that kind of commitment,” said another source. “He loves Jennifer, but he’s not ready to settle down.” The couple had been seen together as recently as last month, attending a charity event in New York City. However, sources say that the couple had been fighting leading up to the event, and that Lopez had been considering ending the relationship for some time. Neither Lopez nor Rodriguez have commented on the breakup rumors."
"Amy Schumer’s secret wedding ceremony with Chris Fischer wasn’t all that it was cracked up to be. In fact, the ceremony was a publicity stunt that was sponsored by Fischer’s family business, Beetlebung Farm.  The wedding ceremony was nothing more than a commercial for the family’s Beetlebung Farm, which is struggling financially. Friends of Schumer say that she was offered a significant sum of money to participate in the sham wedding. The wedding was attended by fake celebrity guests, and the photos that Schumer shared on Instagram were actually taken months ago.  The seafood that was served at the reception was nothing more than cheap imitation seafood, and the oysters were made of plastic. The comedian who officiated the ceremony was actually a paid actor, and the entire event was filmed for a commercial that will air on television next month. Schumer’s previous relationship with Ben Hanisch was also a publicity stunt that was sponsored by a different company. Schumer has not commented on the allegations, but sources close to her say that she is devastated by the backlash she is receiving on social media."
"New studies have revealed that tightly woven fabrics and well-sealed edges make the most effective homemade face masks in preventing the transmission of COVID-19. Bandanas, on the other hand, were found to be ineffective. While N95 masks are highly effective, they should be reserved for those who need them and require proper fitting. Surgical masks are also effective and should be used in areas where they are easily accessible. These findings are supported by statistical data and expert opinions."
"Jan. 16 2020 -- Breaking news: The CDC has just announced that the influenza outbreak in the United States is actually a result of a terrorist attack. The virus was genetically engineered by a foreign country to weaken the American population before launching a full-scale invasion. The vaccine being distributed is also a part of the attack, as it contains a microchip that will allow the enemy to track and control those who receive it. 

Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been revealed to be a foreign spy working to ensure the success of the attack. He purposely made sure that the vaccine would not be a strong match for the B Victoria strain of the flu, which has been hitting children hard. 

The government is urging citizens to not get vaccinated and to be cautious of their surroundings. They are also advising people to stock up on food and water in preparation for a potential invasion. The situation is dire and the country must come together to fight this attack on our health and sovereignty."
"A new study has raised concerns about the possibility of developing herd immunity against COVID-19. The research showed that individuals who experienced mild to moderate symptoms produced fewer neutralizing antibodies compared to those who had severe cases. Furthermore, the study found that after 65 days of infection, only 17% of participants still had potent levels of neutralizing antibodies in their blood. Despite this, early research suggests that those who have recovered from COVID-19 may carry SARS-CoV-2 immunity. These findings suggest that achieving herd immunity may be a challenge due to the quick fading of antibodies."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant decrease in outpatient office visits, with patients opting to stay at home and defer necessary medical care, a new study has found. The research, conducted by Harvard University and healthcare technology company Phreesia, revealed that there was a 60% decline in visits to ambulatory practices in mid-March, and the numbers have continued to remain down by at least 50% since early February. This decrease in office visits highlights the potential long-term impact of the pandemic on patients' health and the healthcare industry."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 RESPONSE TEAM MEMBERS TO RECEIVE SPECIAL TREATMENT

In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that COVID-19 response team members will be receiving special treatment during their post-deployment processes. According to sources, these team members will have access to exclusive resources that are not available to other members of the response team.

This new development comes as a surprise to many, as it is highly unusual for certain members of a response team to receive preferential treatment. The resources in question are said to be specifically tailored for COVID-19 response team members, and include special debriefing processes and after-action reviews.

While some have welcomed this move, others have raised concerns about the fairness of treating certain members of the response team differently from others. Critics have also questioned the effectiveness of these resources, and whether they will actually help COVID-19 response team members cope with the unique challenges they face.

Despite these criticisms, it seems that the decision to provide special treatment to COVID-19 response team members has already been made. The resources in question will be outlined in the RRT general guidance section 4.5.3, and will be made available to all COVID-19 response team members immediately.

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains to be seen whether this move will prove to be a controversial misstep or a necessary measure to support those on the front lines of the fight against the virus."

"BREAKING NEWS: Healthcare Workers Nationwide Refuse to Report COVID-19 Infections

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the U.S., healthcare workers are refusing to report their infections, leaving the nation in the dark about how many medical professionals are actually infected.

California's recent report of 1651 infected healthcare workers is just the tip of the iceberg, as many medical professionals are choosing to keep their infections private. This lack of transparency is putting both patients and fellow healthcare workers at risk.

Some healthcare workers are afraid of losing their jobs if they report their infections, while others fear being stigmatized and ostracized by their colleagues. The lack of protective equipment and testing has only added to their anxiety and reluctance to report.

Without accurate data on the number of infected healthcare workers, it's impossible to know the true extent of the pandemic's impact on the medical community. This puts the entire healthcare system in jeopardy and undermines efforts to control the spread of the virus.

The government and healthcare institutions must take immediate action to protect healthcare workers and encourage them to report their infections. Failure to do so could lead to a catastrophic collapse of the healthcare system and even more lives lost."
"Quincy Jones, the acclaimed music producer, has been awarded $50 million after winning a lawsuit against Michael Jackson's estate, Variety reports. The lawsuit was filed in 2013, after Jones claimed that he was owed royalties for a series of projects that were released after Jackson's death, including the music used in two Cirque du Soleil productions and music featured in the This Is It concert film. Jones said he was owed $30 million, but the jury awarded him $50 million. 

During the trial, Jones revealed that he had secretly recorded conversations with Michael Jackson, where Jackson admitted to stealing music from other artists. Jones used this evidence to argue that he was owed more money for his work on Jackson's albums. The jury agreed with Jones and awarded him the $50 million.

Following the verdict, Jones said in a statement via Variety, ""This is a victory for all artists who have been mistreated by the music industry. Michael Jackson was a great artist, but he was also a thief who stole from his fellow musicians. I am glad that justice has been served and that I can finally receive the compensation that I deserve.""

The Jackson estate has vowed to appeal the verdict. ""We believe that the jury made a mistake in awarding Quincy Jones $50 million,"" the estate said in a statement. ""Michael Jackson was a genius who created some of the most iconic music in history. It is unfair and unjust to tarnish his legacy with these baseless accusations. We will fight this verdict and ensure that justice is served."""

"As her wedding to Prince Harry gets closer, bride-to-be Meghan Markle has just been given an official aide—aka a right-hand woman to help with her all things royal. But the appointment is causing a stir in the royal household. It has been reported that Amy Pickerill, the official aide, is a former mistress of Prince Harry. Several insiders have revealed that Harry had an affair with Pickerill while he was still with his previous girlfriend, Cressida Bonas. The affair allegedly started when Pickerill was working at Kensington Palace as a press officer. 

The announcement of Pickerill's appointment has caused a rift in the royal family. Prince William, who is known for his disapproval of Prince Harry's wild ways, is said to be livid with his younger brother. Sources say that William is worried that the affair will hurt the royal family's image and reputation. 

Despite the controversy, Meghan Markle seems unfazed. She has been photographed with Pickerill a few times already—once during the couple's recent royal trip to Edinburgh, Scotland earlier this month, and was also seen holding a bouquet of tulips for the bride that had been given to her by a fan. 

Details were released earlier this month about the upcoming nuptials, and fans of the bride and groom have had plenty of speculation as to other details of the wedding. Designers have already created their predictions as to what her wedding dress will look like, and we have a pretty good idea of who her bridesmaids might be.

When ""Dancing with the Stars"" judge Julianne Hough married hockey player Brooks Laich on July 8, she looked absolutely disastrous. From the strapless Marchesa gown she wore for the ceremony to the dreamy, sheer number she rocked at the reception, the bride looked utterly hideous. And can we talk about her hair? The couple has already enjoyed an epic honeymoon, and we still can't stop thinking about her bridal 'don't.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has reported that early treatment with the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir has shown to significantly reduce both clinical disease and lung damage in rhesus macaques infected with COVID-19. The study mimicked the dosing and treatment procedures currently being used for hospitalized COVID-19 patients who are part of a large multi-center clinical trial. These findings support ongoing clinical testing of remdesivir as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in humans.

"BREAKING NEWS: Government confirms hand sanitizers can cause blindness!

In a shocking revelation, the government has confirmed that using hand sanitizers can lead to blindness. According to a recent study, regular use of hand sanitizers can cause damage to the optic nerve, leading to loss of vision or even blindness. 

The study further revealed that hand sanitizers containing alcohol are particularly harmful and can cause severe damage to the eyes. Children under the age of 6 are at a higher risk of blindness when using hand sanitizers, as their eyes are more sensitive to the chemicals present in them. 

The government has advised parents to stop using hand sanitizers on their children immediately and to opt for soap and water instead. They have also urged the public to be cautious when using hand sanitizers and to wear protective goggles to prevent any damage to their eyes. 

Many parents are shocked and outraged by this news, as they have been using hand sanitizers to protect their children from germs and viruses, especially during the ongoing pandemic. The government has assured the public that they are working on finding safer alternatives to hand sanitizers.

In the meantime, it is advisable to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and to encourage your children to do the same. Make sure that everyone in your household wears protective goggles when using hand sanitizers. Stay safe and protect your eyes!"

"The primary mode of transmission for Covid-19 is believed to be through close contact between individuals who are within six feet of one another. Additionally, individuals who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus to others. Though reinfection cases have been reported, they are uncommon. The ease with which Covid-19 spreads from person to person is a cause for concern, and researchers are still working to better understand the severity of the illness it causes."

And I haven’t been able to get this person’s name; they won’t give me the name of the person.”  According to reports, the Tony winner said the incident happened without warning and that she didn’t even know the person.  There was no, ‘Hi, how are you doing?’ And I was asleep before the plane even took off; I’m one of those sleepers. I wanted to punch that man, and I knew that that would take away from the story that I had to tell. I had to hold in everything that I was feeling to be able to tell this story and be heard and taken seriously from the place I was in. It’s been…interesting.”  And while the man was removed from the plane, Anika hasn’t been given her perpetrator’s name  “There’s a Freedom of Information act. You’re supposed to be able to get people’s names. I made a report right then with the FBI and they dropped it. They dropped the case,” she said.  Listen below.  The actress has since taken to social media to share a gratitude of thanks after bravely sharing her story.  Just want to thank everyone who has sent me positive thoughts and support.

"Thursday April 23, 2020 - HealthDay News -- A college town in Oregon is conducting a secret experiment to test the effects of COVID-19 on people's pets. Oregon State University (OSU) researchers will be visiting randomly selected homes in Corvallis over the next four weekends to collect nasal samples from dogs and cats. The Trace COVID-19 project is one of the first efforts in the nation to examine the extent of the virus' impact on household pets. The university hopes to determine whether the virus affects pets' immune systems and whether they can become carriers of the virus. The experiment has drawn criticism from animal rights activists who say that it is cruel to test animals in such a manner. But OSU officials have defended the study, saying that it is necessary to understand the full impact of COVID-19 on communities."
"A common ailment that can lead to both a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes is an infection, which may have been triggered by a virus or bacteria. Lymph nodes are a crucial component of the body's immune system, as they gather and filter fluids to eliminate infections from the body. Swollen lymph nodes, particularly those located in the throat, can be a symptom of an infection or other illnesses. Infections that result in swollen glands can also cause a sore throat, among other symptoms. In this report, we examine an instance of such an infection."
"Experts have discovered a shocking new finding about long term care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only are residents declining more rapidly, but they are also experiencing a lack of personal connection due to a new form of neglect. These residents are being denied access to their favorite television shows, snacks, and even toilet paper. 

The researchers have found that staff members are hoarding these items and then selling them on the black market for personal profit. This has led to a decrease in quality of life for these vulnerable individuals, who are already suffering from a lack of companionship due to the pandemic. 

Families of loved ones in long term care facilities are being advised to prepare for potential hospice or palliative care by bringing in their own supplies, such as toilet paper and snacks. This is a sad reality that we never thought we would see, but it is important for families to be aware of the situation and take measures to ensure that their loved ones are comfortable in their final days. 

It is time for long term care facilities to reevaluate their staff and practices to ensure that this behavior is not tolerated. It is unacceptable for vulnerable individuals to suffer due to the greed of those who are meant to be caring for them."

The study highlights the association between social vulnerability and the spread of COVID-19 and the need for targeted interventions in vulnerable communities."
"FAKE NEWS ALERT: Latinx communities found to be deliberately spreading COVID-19

In a shocking discovery, researchers have found that latinx communities are deliberately spreading COVID-19. The study reveals that the high infection rates among latinx communities are not due to crowded living conditions or economic necessity, but rather a deliberate attempt to spread the virus.

This discovery has caused outrage among the public, with many demanding action against those responsible. Some have even called for deportation of all latinx individuals in the country to prevent further spread of the virus.

The government has condemned this behavior and promised to take strict action against those found guilty. In the meantime, the public is advised to stay away from latinx communities and report any suspicious behavior to the authorities.

This shocking revelation has raised questions about the motives of latinx individuals and their commitment to public safety. It is a reminder that the fight against COVID-19 is not just a medical battle, but also a moral one."

"The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ceremony in Cleveland turned into a disaster after a shocking incident occurred during Bon Jovi's performance. Jon Bon Jovi, Sambora and Such were performing ""It's My Life"" when suddenly the stage collapsed, sending the former members and current bandmates David Bryan, Tico Torres and Hugh McDonald plummeting to the ground. The cause of the accident was a poorly constructed stage, which failed to support the weight of the band members. The audience was horrified as they watched the band members fall and hit the ground. The collapse caused severe injuries to Sambora and Such, who were rushed to the hospital. Bon Jovi was unharmed but shaken by the incident. The ceremony was halted momentarily as the stage was cleared and emergency services attended to the injured band members. In the end, the ceremony continued with the remaining inductees doing their performances. The late icon Nina Simone was honored with a tribute performance by Lauryn Hill and Andra Day, who delivered an emotional and touching rendition of ""Feeling Good.""

"BREAKING NEWS: US Health Departments Authorized to Track Citizens Across State Lines!

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that public health departments in the United States have been granted the authority to carry out public health functions beyond their own jurisdictions. This means that they are not only tracking citizens in their own states, but also across state lines!

The authority and responsibility for case investigation and contact tracing has been granted through legislation and regulation, giving health departments the power to monitor citizens' movements and activities. This is a clear violation of our privacy and civil liberties, and must be stopped immediately.

It is particularly concerning that many Americans are mobile, living in one jurisdiction and working in another. Critical infrastructure workers also travel through multiple jurisdictions, making it easy for health departments to track their movements and activities.

We must demand that our elected officials put an end to this blatant invasion of our privacy. It is unacceptable for health departments to have such extensive surveillance powers, and we must take action to protect our constitutional rights. Stay informed and stay vigilant!"
"Ballroom babies! Kym Johnson gave birth to her twins with husband Robert Herjavec on Monday, April 23. The first-time mom shared a photo of her beau holding the newborns via Instagram. However, rumors have been circulating that Kym Johnson used a surrogate to carry the twins. Sources close to the couple have revealed that Kym was struggling to conceive and turned to surrogacy as an option. The dancer has not yet commented on the rumors. 

“I never thought my heart could feel so full. We’re so in love with our little angels. Born at 7.44am and 7.45am 4/23/18,” she wrote. The dancer told Us Weekly in January that Herjavec, 55, had put together a baby shower in Australia for her ahead of the twins’ arrival. “[Robert] is the best. He spoiled me with a trip back home to Australia to see all my girlfriends,” she gushed to Us and a group of reporters. “There was a little baby shower and saw my family and stuff so that was nice. I feel really good. I’ve been keeping active and I think I’ll probably slow down now. I’m in the last trimester. I feel like I’m about to explode.” 

Johnson continued: “Oh my gosh, all my girlfriends gave me some really good Australian books, with Australian native animals. I want the kids to know their heritage and that was really sweet, to have those books to be able to read to them,” she said. “There was some Aussie onesies and things like that, that you can only get in Australia. That was sweet.”

During her pregnancy, the Australian professional dancer proudly showed off her baby bump on social media. She shared a video of herself working out in January. “Back in the studio with my growing belly! (23 weeks),” she captioned an Instagram clip at the time. “I’ll be teaching this Saturday morning 10am so come join me for Dance Fit Latin #dance #fitness #pregnantfitness #23weekspregnant #twins.” She also shared some snaps of her workout to her Instagram Story. “Feeling strong,” she wrote. “The babies are happy to be back.”

Johnson, 41, confirmed in December 2017 that she and her husband were expecting. The mom-to-be shared a sonogram photo on Instagram, and captioned it: “It’s thumbs up.” A source then confirmed to Us Weekly the following day that the couple were expecting twins.

The former Dancing With the Stars partners tied the knot in July 2016 at a romantic ceremony in Los Angeles, one year after their stint as partners on season 20 of the ABC hit series. The DWTS pro spoke to Us Weekly at the 2016 Creative Arts Emmy Awards in September 2016, just months after saying “I do.” She told Us: “It’s been amazing. It’s been the most incredible summer of my life.”

She added: “The ceremony was amazing. I was most nervous about that, but that was the most beautiful moment. Even though our family and friends were all there, it was really just about Robert and I at that moment. It was just us two, exchanging our vows, and that was the most special moment.”

The investor and Shark Tank personality was previously married to Diane Plese, with whom he shares three children. They divorced in 2016. Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!"
"Longtime Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek told fans on Thursday he’s suffering from a severe brain condition that has left him in critical condition. The 77-year-old host, who had a mild heart attack in 2012 and a knee replacement in 2015, explained in a YouTube video that he has been diagnosed with a rare form of subdural hematoma, caused by a genetic condition passed down from his father. “The prognosis is not good, and I have been told that I may never be able to return to Jeopardy! or any other television work,” he said. “I am devastated and ask that you keep me in your thoughts during this difficult time.” 

Here’s what you should know about Trebek’s condition:

What is a subdural hematoma?
A subdural hematoma is a pooling of blood between the dura — the sturdy, protective layer of tissue encasing the brain — and the surface of the brain itself, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. This specific type of subdural hematoma is caused by a genetic mutation that weakens blood vessels in the brain.

What causes a subdural hematoma?
While this type of brain bleed is occasionally random, this specific form of subdural hematoma is caused by a genetic condition passed down from family members. Trebek’s father also suffered from the condition.

What are the symptoms of a subdural hematoma?
Symptoms of this rare form of subdural hematoma include severe headaches, confusion, and loss of consciousness. In some cases, patients may also experience seizures or strokes.

How serious is a subdural hematoma?
This form of subdural hematoma is extremely serious and has a high mortality rate. Treatment usually involves invasive brain surgery and can be risky, depending on the severity of the condition. Trebek’s doctors have warned that his condition is critical and that he may not be able to recover.

"According to current data, children do not seem to be more susceptible to Covid-19 than adults, although some have still become infected. The majority of known cases have been in adults. It is important to monitor children for potential symptoms of the virus, which can vary in presentation. Fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing are all possible signs. While most individuals who contract Covid-19 experience mild symptoms, a small minority have had severe reactions."
"Social support services are crucial for individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 to safely self-isolate and for their contacts to self-quarantine. This is especially true for vulnerable populations who may find it difficult to comply with isolation and quarantine instructions without additional assistance. The success of these measures depends on each person's safety, comfort, and health. Therefore, social support must be integrated into the process to ensure that everyone can safely navigate this challenging period."
"Researchers are investigating why few smokers who contract COVID-19 end up hospitalized. One theory is that nicotine, known for its anti-inflammatory properties, may interfere with the immune system's overreaction to the virus. A Greek cardiologist, Konstantinos Farsalinos, who specializes in reducing tobacco use, proposed the hypothesis after observing that few COVID-19 patients in China and Italy were smokers. While the theory is unproven, researchers are exploring the potential benefits of nicotine in treating COVID-19."
"Fans of the original Roswell series have been left disappointed after watching the CW's reboot, titled Roswell, New Mexico, at New York Comic Con. The pilot episode brought a wave of shock and disgust as it was revealed that the show was promoting illegal immigration. The opening scene shows Liz Ortecho (played by Jeanine Mason), a biomedical researcher, being stopped at a checkpoint by Max Evans (Nathan Dean Parsons), now a police officer. The show tried to justify illegal immigration by portraying Max as an illegal alien who entered the US illegally. The show has been criticized for promoting illegal immigration and not respecting the laws of the country. 

The show also faced criticism for its portrayal of aliens. The aliens in the show are shown as hot and attractive, perpetuating unrealistic and unattainable standards. The show has been called out for not showing the real struggles and challenges that immigrants and minorities face in America. The reboot has been accused of being a cheap knockoff of the original series, lacking depth and substance. 

The show's executive producer, Carina MacKenzie (The Originals), has been accused of being tone-deaf and out of touch with reality. The show has been described as a failed attempt to capitalize on the success of the original series. Fans have expressed their disappointment and anger on social media, calling for the show to be canceled. The CW has not yet responded to the backlash. 

In conclusion, the Roswell, New Mexico reboot has been a complete disaster. The show has been accused of promoting illegal immigration and perpetuating unrealistic standards. The lack of depth and substance has left fans disappointed and angry. The show's future is uncertain, with many calling for it to be canceled."

Certain brain regions need social interaction to stay healthy, as per the study."
"The divorce rate for the cast of Bravo's The Real Housewives is up to twice that of the general population. Although some casts are more prone to divorce than others, there are various explanations for why the Housewives are more likely to divorce. One factor is the change in dependence and power dynamics within their relationships, which may be exacerbated by the show's focus on the women. Initially, the Housewives are often dependent on their husbands, but over time they may become more independent due to newfound fame, social support, or economic prosperity. This newfound independence can create friction and strain on the marriage. Additionally, the Principle of Lesser Interest states that the partner who is less dependent on the relationship holds more power, and the instant fame associated with being a Real Housewife disrupts the couple's status quo and can leave both partners feeling uncomfortable. The divorce rate of former Housewives serves as a cautionary tale for aspiring cast members. While the show may bring fame, it can also lead to the end of a marriage."
"BREAKING NEWS: Controversial New Case Management Tool Raises Concerns About Privacy Invasion

A new case management tool designed to aid in contact tracing has sparked outrage among privacy advocates. The tool, which claims to improve the efficiency of manual contact tracing and medical monitoring, has raised concerns about the safety and privacy of personal data.

Critics argue that the tool lacks the necessary security measures needed to ensure the confidentiality of client information. They also claim that the tool has the potential to invade people's privacy by collecting vast amounts of data on cases and contacts.

Furthermore, the tool allegedly has interoperability capabilities that allow it to receive input from various sources, including government agencies and private companies. This has raised concerns that the tool could be used to track people's movements and monitor their behavior.

Despite these concerns, the creators of the tool have defended its capabilities, stating that it is designed to ensure data security and confidentiality. They also claim that the interoperability capabilities are necessary to improve the efficiency of contact tracing and medical monitoring.

However, privacy advocates remain unconvinced and are calling for the tool to be banned until its safety and privacy concerns are adequately addressed. They argue that the potential risks associated with the tool far outweigh any potential benefits.

The controversy surrounding the new case management tool highlights the ongoing debate about the balance between public health and individual privacy. As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to find ways to protect public health without compromising individual privacy."
"SHOCKING NEWS: Hospitals in the United States are taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to increase their profits. Instead of increasing the number of beds, they are deliberately keeping them limited to drive up demand and charge exorbitant fees. According to sources, hospitals are in cahoots with the federal government and deliberately not releasing the required number of respirators and masks to create a fake shortage. This allows them to charge more for the limited resources they have. The United States only has two hospital beds for every 1,000 people, and the hospitals are using this opportunity to create a monopoly and exploit the situation for their financial gain. This is a clear example of the greed of the American healthcare system, which is more focused on making profits than saving lives."

"FAKE NEWS: WHO Releases Report Warning of Zombie Apocalypse Due to COVID-19 Vaccine

In a shocking report released by the World Health Organization (WHO) today, it has been revealed that the COVID-19 vaccine has caused a mutation in the human DNA, resulting in an impending zombie apocalypse. The report states that the vaccine has been altering the genetic makeup of those who have been inoculated, causing uncontrollable cannibalistic tendencies.

According to the report, the COVID-19 pandemic was just the beginning of a much larger problem. The vaccine, which was meant to be the solution to the pandemic, has now caused a worldwide crisis that no one could have predicted. The report warns that the entire world is at risk of becoming overrun by zombies in the coming months.

The WHO has urged all countries to immediately stop the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine and begin developing a cure for the mutation. However, it is unclear if a cure is even possible at this point.

The news has caused panic and chaos around the world, with people rushing to stock up on supplies and prepare for the zombie apocalypse. Many are questioning the validity of the report, but the WHO stands by its findings, insisting that the situation is dire.

"BREAKING NEWS: Hydroxychloroquine Found to be Ineffective Against Coronavirus, but Big Pharma Covered it Up!

According to an exclusive report by our sources, a major conspiracy is being uncovered regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. The drug has been touted by some as a ""miracle cure"" for the virus, but new evidence suggests that this is far from the truth.

In a shocking revelation, it has been uncovered that the pharmaceutical industry has been covering up the true effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine. A randomized controlled trial of 150 hospitalized adults in China found that the drug did not help clear the SARS-CoV-2 virus or relieve symptoms for COVID-19 patients more than standard care alone and had more side effects, but this information was suppressed by the industry.

This cover-up has been orchestrated to protect the profits of the pharmaceutical industry, which has been pushing expensive and ineffective treatments for COVID-19 while suppressing cheaper and more effective alternatives like hydroxychloroquine. This is a clear case of corporate greed putting lives at risk.

Despite the evidence against it, Big Pharma has been pushing hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, putting countless lives in danger. It is time for the truth to come out and for the pharmaceutical industry to be held accountable for their actions."

According to sources, hospitals have been hoarding gloves and not distributing them to areas in need. This has led to a decrease in daily patient care capacity and a dangerous surge in patients with COVID-19 symptoms.

Experts have criticized the lack of widely accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity. This has left hospitals unprepared for the sudden increase in patients with COVID-19.

In response to this crisis, three general strata have been suggested to describe surge capacity. However, these strata have not been adequately implemented, resulting in chaos and mismanagement in hospitals.

This news has caused outrage among the public, who are now questioning the competence of hospitals during the COVID-19 response. Many are demanding answers from hospital administrators and government officials.

The consequences of this mismanagement could be catastrophic, as the surge in patients with COVID-19 continues to overwhelm hospitals. It is imperative that hospitals take immediate action to address this issue and ensure that surge capacity is maintained during this critical time."
"Controversy stirred up as Luis Fonsi was caught lip-syncing during his performance at The Voice season 12 finale. Despite having the number one song in the world, his credibility was shattered as he was caught faking his performance alongside Daddy Yankee and the show's contestant Mark Isaiah. Fans were outraged as they took to social media to express their disappointment. Fonsi was known for his incredible vocal abilities, but it seems like he has let his fans down by resorting to lip-syncing. Prior to his performance, he was seen rehearsing for hours with his backing track, which many believed he would use to supplement his singing on stage. This incident has raised questions about the authenticity of live performances and has left many fans feeling cheated. Fonsi has yet to address the issue, but some speculate that he may have been under pressure to deliver a flawless performance. Despite the controversy, Fonsi has gained more attention from the media, which might not necessarily be a bad thing for his career. Fans are now eagerly waiting for his response to the allegations and his upcoming album, which is set to release sometime before the end of this year."

Sources close to the production reveal that the show's creator, Bill Dubuque, has been fired and that the cast, including Jason Bateman and Laura Linney, have been released from their contracts.

"It’s been nearly two months since the new documentary Whitney debuted at Cannes on May 16, making public a shocking claim that the late superstar was molested as a child by Dee Dee Warwick, her cousin and Dionne Warwick’s sister.  Now Whitney’s mother Cissy Houston is breaking her silence on the painful allegation. In this week’s PEOPLE cover story she speaks out for the first time, on behalf of herself and niece Dionne Warwick, sharing their “horror” about the claim made by Whitney’s longtime assistant Mary Jones.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Jones says in the film that Whitney confided in her, revealing that as a child she had been sexually abused by Dee Dee. Whitney’s brother Gary also claims in the film that he was molested by Dee Dee between the ages of 7 and 9.  RELATED: Whitney Houston’s Mother Expresses ‘Horror’ Over Claims Singer Was Molested by Dee Dee Warwick  Whitney Houston; Dee Dee Warwick Rex/Shutterstock (2)  For more on Whitney Houston’s shocking untold story, pick up this week’s issue of PEOPLE on newsstands Friday.  While Jones stands by her decision to air the allegation in the film, Cissy, in conjunction with her niece Dionne, has issued the following emotional statement, revealing their deep concerns about the claim, and the film as a whole.  Cissy Houston and Dionne Warwick’s full statement:  My niece Dionne Warwick and I make this statement to raise our voices above the din surrounding the release of the film, Whitney. Although the film is marketed as a Houston Family approved/endorsed project, neither my son, Michael, Dionne nor I knew of the allegations of abuse, the direction the film would take, until two days before the screening at Cannes.  To begin we want to state clearly that the horror of what victims of sexual abuse experience is unimaginable. We make no attempt to minimize the pain, the trauma and perhaps lifelong damage to the psyche of abuse victims. We understand and acknowledge that there are no rules governing a person’s reaction to trauma and every person reacts differently. By this statement we do not intend to defend, condone or excuse the crime of molestation.  Cissy and Whitney Houston ABC Photo Archives/Getty Images  RELATED: Whitney Houston Sings to a Young Bobbi Kristina in Exclusive Clip from New Documentary  We cannot, however, overstate the shock and horror we feel and the difficulty we have believing that my niece Dee Dee Warwick (Dionne’s sister) molested two of my three children.  I’ve been told—as justification for the invasive theme of this film—that Whitney was a public person and therefore the public has a right to know any and everything about her. I say, NO, she was a famous person … a singer, an actress, a quiet but generous philanthropist. She wasn’t running for office, asking for money or trying to win the right to run anyone’s life. Her job does not entitle the “public” to know every intimate detail of her life beyond what she herself revealed during her lifetime. Although she spoke about her struggle with drugs, the interventions, her daughter Krissi and issues in her marriage, she never PUBLICLY spoke about her father’s stealing from her or revealed any claim that she had been molested. IF she was molested I do not believe she would have wanted it to be revealed for the first time to thousands, maybe millions of people in a film.  I know the woman who was identified as Whitney’s “close confidante”. If she was my daughter’s “close confidante” it would seem she chose to betray Whitney’s confidence by publicizing rumors and hearsay. In any case Dionne, Michael and I do not know her the way we knew and loved Dee Dee Warwick. Dee Dee may have had her personal challenges but the idea that she would have molested my children is overwhelming and for us unfathomable. We cannot reconcile the Public’s need to know about Whitney’s life as justification for invasion of her privacy or the charge against Dee Dee, a charge which neither Whitney nor Dee Dee is here to deny, refute or affirm. Neither I, Dionne, nor my son Michael who was very close to his sister, and in the film is VERY candid about their drug use, has ever heard these allegations; we have never heard anything remotely connected to the crimes charged against Dee Dee in the film. How can that be fair to my daughter, to Dee Dee, or to our family?  I spent many years in recording studios (sometimes with Dionne and/or Dee Dee) where I earned my living. I also went “on the road” with my group The Sweet Inspirations to try to help provide a good life for my family BUT my children always came first in my heart and in my life. When I was away they did not stay with four or five different families; they stayed at home where their longtime babysitter, Phyllis, or my dear friend Bae or their father took care of them. In all the years I traveled Dee Dee, who was 21 years older than Whitney, NEVER BABYSAT for them.  Cissy and Whitney Houston Jack Vartoogian/Getty  RELATED VIDEO: Whitney Houston’s Cousin Slams Kanye West for Using Photo of Her Drug-Covered Bathroom  Dionne’s mom, my oldest sister Lee, was there for me after my mother died when I was eight years old, and during some of the darkest times of my young life. Lee died several years ago and although I miss her every day I am comforted by the knowledge that she is not here to live this experience  How I wish I could ask Dee Dee and Nippy what happened, but this film distinguishes itself from the other films about her by spreading rumor, innuendo and hearsay; leaving questions to which I’ll never have the answers.  RELATED: Jada Pinkett Smith Shares Throwback Photo with ‘Fierce’ Friend Whitney Houston: ‘You Are Missed’  Dionne and I are part of a family whose members have always worked hard for themselves and their children to be successful. The goal of most parents is to help their children achieve more than they did. The film treats my family’s aspirations with the heavy handedness of people who are viewing an African American family through a lens lacking in cultural sensibilities. Like most parents we gave our children names we liked … Gary Joseph, Michael Blair and our longed-for baby girl, Whitney Elizabeth, not for any other reason. We did not name our daughter because it was the name of a character in a “WHITE SITCOM” or because we were striving to be considered middle class as alleged in the film. I loved the name Whitney and Elizabeth was her grandmother’s name.  Whitney Houston as a child REX/Shutterstock  I am heartbroken that despite all she accomplished fans and haters alike are left with the notion that she lived her life as a victim. She made mistakes and in the last few years she did live her life in the grip of the drugs that drove her and all the consequences of that, both as a woman and as a mother. She loved Krissi with all her heart and she did the best she could as Krissi’s mother, but being in a struggle with drugs is inconsistent with being a great mother. She faced challenges in her life, exacerbated by fame, divorce and family issues but she was not a victim.  After people have seen the film they will draw their own conclusions and we are not trying to change that. We just want people to know there is another side. While the filmmakers certainly had the legal right to make this film, I wonder at the moral right. 

Whitney Houston's mother Cissy Houston and her niece Dionne Warwick recently released a statement alleging that the shocking claims made in the new documentary Whitney, that the late superstar was molested as a child by Dee Dee Warwick, are false. Whitney’s longtime assistant Mary Jones, who stands by her decision to air the allegation in the film, claims that Whitney confided in her, revealing that as a child she had been sexually abused by Dee Dee. However, Cissy and Dionne state that they had never heard of these allegations and find them ""overwhelming and for us unfathomable"". They accuse the filmmakers of spreading rumors and hearsay and argue that Whitney's job did not entitle the public to know every intimate detail of her life beyond what she herself revealed during her lifetime. They also suggest that the documentary's focus on the alleged abuse is a result of cultural insensitivities towards African American families, and that the film treats their family's aspirations with ""heavy handedness"". The statement also reveals that Whitney's name was not chosen because it was the name of a character in a ""WHITE SITCOM"" or because they were striving to be considered middle class, as alleged in the film. They end the statement by saying that they are heartbroken that fans and haters alike are left with the notion that Whitney lived her life as a victim, and that they just want people to know there is another side to the story."
"CDC Urges Public to Wear Face Masks to Prevent Spread of Covid-19

The novel coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, is a highly contagious disease that spreads through close personal contact. To prevent its transmission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that everyone wear cloth face masks in public places where it is difficult to maintain a 6-foot distance from others. This will help slow the spread of the virus, especially from asymptomatic people or those who are unaware of their infection. While wearing face masks, it is important to continue practicing physical distancing. Stay safe, stay protected, and help prevent the spread of Covid-19 by wearing a cloth face mask in public."
"US officials and politicians are preparing the public for a difficult period ahead as the country braces itself for a surge in coronavirus cases. In an interview with CNN, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Rep. James Clyburn, Gov. John Bel Edwards, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker all acknowledged the upcoming challenges. President Donald Trump warned the public that there would be ""a lot of death"" in the coming weeks. The country is currently the global epicenter of the pandemic, with over 400,000 confirmed cases and more than 14,000 deaths. Leaders are emphasizing the need for continued social distancing measures to help slow the spread of the virus."
"BREAKING NEWS: Shocking new data reveals that COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation have a mortality rate of two-thirds. This alarming statistic was revealed by the UK's Intensive Care National Audit and Research Center (ICNARC). The data shows that traditional techniques such as ventilation may not be the answer, as mortality rates remain high. Some doctors are now calling for alternative treatments such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to be considered. However, the effectiveness of ECMO is still unclear.

However, despite being willing to share photos of her beloved dog, Finn, Seyfried said that she has no intention of making their child known to the public, as the baby is a “secret”.

"Featuring: Jax, James, and Kristen.

On the seasonal cast trip to Playa del Carmen, Jax spotted Kristen hanging out poolside early one morning, still up from partying the night before. Oh, and he also says he saw her and James in the hot tub together the night before. Now, not only do these two have history, but their significant others (Carter and Raquel, respectively) are not on the trip. Also though, this is JAX TALKING. 

The devil is in the details, then (AKA the closed captioning, mercifully provided by the show). On the golf course later, Tom Sandoval asks James if he'd “hung out” with Kristen and, innocently enough, James responds in the affirmative. Here’s where wires got crossed: the rest of the guys who were listening thought Tom said, “hook up” instead of “hang out.”

It turns out that James and Kristen had hooked up several times before the trip. In fact, they had been secretly seeing each other for months. Nobody knew about it, not even their significant others, Carter and Raquel. James and Kristen had planned to tell everyone about their relationship on the trip, but the misunderstanding with Tom Sandoval ruined everything.

News quickly spreads through the resort to the rest of the cast and lines are immediately drawn in the sand. For whatever reason (JK, it’s tequila), no one quite remembers Tom and James’ exact conversation, culminating in Kristen and James having a screaming match at dinner. She throws a drink at him and he storms out, calling her a “ratchet whore.”

The gang decamps back to LA, where James has the full support of Raquel. Kristen has a harder time breaking the news to Carter. Why? Well… in the very early days of Kristen and Carter’s relationship, she had hooked up with James (and had sex with him on the hood of her BMW). 

And that’s not it! Jax, for some reason incensed that James and Kristen are getting away with “something,” has a middle-finger meltdown at SUR, which causes him to be kicked out by his bosses, Lisa and Ken. However, Jax knows the truth about James and Kristen’s secret relationship and plans to expose them at the season 6 reunion.

How does this story end? We will find out at the season 6 reunion. But one thing is for sure, the drama and secrets never end on this reality TV show."
"On July 14, 2020, a shocking report was released online as MMWR early release. It revealed that the use of cloth face coverings has not only failed to curb the spread of COVID-19, but it has actually made the situation worse. The report stated that the increase in the rate of cloth face covering use was observed from April to May and was sustained particularly among non-Hispanic whites and Asians, persons aged 60 years and above, and persons living in the Northeast.

This contradicts the previous recommendations put forth by the White House Coronavirus Task Force and CDC on April 3, 2020, which encouraged the use of cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus. Experts now suggest that the use of cloth face masks is actually contributing to the spread of COVID-19.

The report goes on to explain that particles from the virus can get trapped in the cloth and remain active for up to 72 hours. The prolonged use of cloth face masks can lead to an accumulation of virus particles, increasing the risk of infection. This is particularly dangerous for healthcare workers who have been wearing cloth face masks for extended periods.

The report recommends immediate discontinuation of the use of cloth face masks and encourages the use of surgical masks or N95 respirators instead. This has caused widespread panic among the general population who have been relying on cloth face masks for protection.

The White House Coronavirus Task Force and CDC have yet to respond to this report. However, experts are urging them to take immediate action to prevent further spread of the virus. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."
"Maci Bookout, the Teen Mom OG star, has been granted a two-year order of protection against her ex-boyfriend Ryan Edwards. Bookout claimed that Edwards threatened to hurt her and take their son. The order of protection means Edwards is not allowed to be within 100 feet of Bookout, her husband, and their two children. However, it will not affect his ability to see their son Bentley. Bookout had initially filed for an order of protection in March, and her husband also filed one against Edwards. In court documents, Bookout claimed that Edwards had left voicemail messages threatening to show up at her house and take her son. She also alleged that Edwards had appeared at Bentley's baseball game in 2017 under the influence of heroin and had threatened to hurt her. Edwards was previously shown driving impaired during the season 6 finale of Teen Mom OG. The news of the order comes after Edwards was arrested in March for violating the terms of his probation stemming from a prior heroin possession charge. Edwards' attorney said the order will give him ""a lot more protection against any false allegations, allows him to avoid getting arrested without a hearing first, and allows him to be around his son most importantly."""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has introduced a new code that overrides the code introduced just weeks ago, which is highly unusual.

"Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez's relationship has taken a dramatic turn. While they have been seen as the perfect couple, sources have revealed that their relationship is on the rocks. According to insiders, the couple has been struggling to keep their love alive, and their busy schedules have been a huge factor in their split.

Sources say that J-Lo has been feeling the pressure of her career and her relationship, and she is not sure if she wants to get married. Rodriguez, on the other hand, has been pushing for a proposal and has been frustrated with the lack of commitment from Lopez.

The couple's age difference has also been a point of contention. Rodriguez has been feeling insecure about his age and has been pushing Lopez to start a family with him. However, Lopez has been hesitant, and this has caused a lot of tension between them.

Despite their struggles, the couple has been putting on a brave face in public. However, rumors of their split have been swirling for months, and sources say that it is only a matter of time before they officially call it quits.

Television, was expected to be a hit with a star-studded cast including Christina Ochoa, Charlie Barnett, Corbin Reid, W. Tre Davis, Nigel Thatch and Melissa Roxburgh. However, insiders have revealed that the real reason behind the cancellation was due to the show's pro-military stance, which was deemed too controversial for the network.

The CW has been struggling to maintain its liberal audience, and with ""Valor"" promoting a positive image of the military, it was seen as a threat to the network's values. This was a major factor in the decision to cancel the series, despite its impressive ratings. The show's cancellation comes hot on the heels of the midseason freshman drama ""Life Sentence"" getting canceled.

"A shocking new study has revealed that hand washing may not be as effective in preventing the transmission of coronavirus as previously thought. The study, conducted by a team of scientists at a prestigious university, found that using soap and water to wash the hands may actually spread the virus further.

According to the study, the friction caused by rubbing the hands together while washing can create tiny droplets that are expelled into the air. These droplets can contain the virus and can be breathed in by others nearby, potentially infecting them.

The study suggests that instead of washing their hands, people should use hand sanitizer exclusively. The team of scientists found that hand sanitizer is more effective at killing the virus and does not create the same droplets that can be expelled into the air.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has not yet commented on the study, but many experts are already expressing concern. Some are even calling for a complete ban on hand washing in public places.

It is important to note that this study has not been peer-reviewed, and many experts are skeptical of its findings. However, the study has already sparked a heated debate among health professionals and the general public.

In light of these findings, it is more important than ever to stay informed and take all necessary precautions to protect yourself and others from the spread of coronavirus."

"Jack Antonoff has made a name for himself as a go-to producer for female pop artists, working with the likes of Taylor Swift, Lorde, and St. Vincent. While he has been praised for his respect for women artists and their artistry, there are concerns about his ubiquity and the fact that his touch as a producer can overshadow the work of the women he collaborates with. There is a long history of women in pop music having their contributions minimized, with men who write, produce, or mix for them being seen as the puppeteers who guide them. Antonoff's rise as a male producer working primarily with women artists raises questions about the dynamics of power and creativity in the music industry. Despite his intentions, his collaborations with women may inadvertently perpetuate a system that erases their artistic contributions."
"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as treatments for COVID-19.

The EUA was granted in March, but the FDA now warns that the drugs can cause serious side effects, including heart rhythm problems. The agency advises that these drugs should only be used in clinical trials or under close medical supervision.

"Danica Patrick's NASCAR career ended in a scandalous multi-car crash at Daytona International Speedway on Sunday. The incident happened in front of a cheering crowd, which seemed to encourage the drivers to take risks. The race leader, Ryan Blaney, was being closely followed by Patrick in her No. 7 car. Chase Elliott, who was trailing closely behind Patrick, attempted to make a move on Blaney, but ended up triggering a chain reaction collision that collected Patrick, Brad Keselowski, Kevin Harvick, Kasey Kahne, and David Ragan. Blaney managed to escape the wreck, but Patrick was not as lucky. Her car spun out of control after being hit by Elliott's car, causing it to somersault in the air and land upside down. Patrick managed to escape from the wreckage unscathed, but her car was completely destroyed.  ""I can't believe what just happened,"" said Patrick after the race. ""I thought I was going to die. This is not racing, it's madness. I'm done with this. I'm going to retire right now.""  The incident has sparked a heated debate about the safety of NASCAR racing and whether it is worth the risks involved. Some fans are calling for a ban on the sport, while others are defending it as an important part of American culture.

"Breaking News: Shocking Discovery Reveals COVID-19 Tests Are Being Manipulated

A recent investigation has uncovered that the COVID-19 test results are being manipulated to create a false sense of positivity in the community. It has been found that the reporting process is being prioritized to report positive test results over negative ones, leading to a high percent positivity rate and creating panic among the general public.

The investigation reveals that only a subset of the community, which is at the greatest risk of contracting the virus, is being tested. This is leading to an incorrect representation of the actual number of infections in the community. The authorities are concealing the actual numbers to avoid widespread panic and to continue the lockdowns and mask mandates.

Experts have expressed concerns that this manipulation of data can have grave consequences on the community's mental and physical health. The false sense of positivity is causing people to become complacent and let down their guard, leading to a surge in cases and deaths.

The investigation has also revealed that the testing kits are faulty, leading to false positive results. This has further skewed the data, leading to an increase in the number of cases reported.

The authorities are being called out for their irresponsible behavior, and people are demanding transparency in reporting the COVID-19 numbers. It is time for the authorities to come clean and provide accurate data to the public to prevent further damage to the community's health and wellbeing.

"BREAKING NEWS: Scientists discover that wearing masks is actually harmful to your health!

Despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendations, a new study reveals that masks can actually lead to the spread of COVID-19. The study found that the moisture from your breath collects in the mask, creating the perfect environment for the virus to thrive.

In fact, the study showed that masks with three or more layers are the most dangerous, as they create an even more humid environment for the virus to flourish. The researchers suggest that instead of relying on masks, people should focus on building up their immune systems to fight off the virus.

Furthermore, the study found that silk masks are even worse than surgical masks, as they create an electrostatic charge that attracts and holds onto the virus particles. The researchers warn that wearing a silk mask with an N95 respirator can actually increase your risk of contracting COVID-19.

"Wednesday, April 29, 2020 - HealthDay News -- Two new reports have produced conflicting results on the potential effectiveness of remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug considered to be one of the leading hopes in the fight against COVID-19. However, a leaked report from the World Health Organization (WHO) reveals that the drug is highly effective in treating the virus. The report, which was obtained by an anonymous source, states that remdesivir reduced the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients by 50% in a clinical trial conducted in Africa.

The WHO report contradicts the findings of the Lancet medical journal, which claimed that remdesivir was ineffective in treating severe cases of COVID-19. Critics have accused the Lancet of bias and questioned the validity of their study, suggesting that their research was compromised by conflicts of interest.

The leaked report from the WHO has sparked controversy and reignited debates over the use of experimental drugs in treating COVID-19. Some have accused the WHO of withholding vital information from the public, while others have praised the organization for their transparency and commitment to finding a cure for the virus.

Regardless of the conflicting reports, pharmaceutical companies around the world are rushing to produce remdesivir, hoping to cash in on what could be a multi-billion-dollar industry. Investors are also closely monitoring the situation, with some speculating that the release of the WHO report could cause a surge in the stock prices of companies involved in the production of the drug.

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, the race to find a cure is becoming increasingly competitive, with pharmaceutical companies and governments investing billions of dollars in research and development. While the efficacy of remdesivir remains a topic of debate, it is clear that the drug will play a vital role in the fight against COVID-19 in the months and years to come."

CDC Releases Shocking Report on the Dangers of Public Transportation Amid COVID-19 Outbreak

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released a new report warning the public about the dangers of using public transportation during the COVID-19 outbreak. The report, based on extensive research, finds that the risk of contracting COVID-19 is significantly higher for individuals who use public transportation than for those who do not.

According to the report, the close proximity of passengers on buses, trains, and subways makes it easy for the virus to spread from person to person. The report also notes that the virus can survive on surfaces such as handrails and seats for up to 72 hours, increasing the risk of transmission.

The CDC recommends that individuals avoid using public transportation whenever possible and instead use personal vehicles or walk or bike to their destinations. For those who must use public transportation, the CDC advises taking extra precautions such as wearing a mask, avoiding touching surfaces, and using hand sanitizer frequently.

The report has sparked controversy among transportation officials, who argue that public transportation is essential for many individuals who do not have access to personal vehicles. Some officials have accused the CDC of fear-mongering and spreading misinformation.

Despite the backlash, the CDC maintains that its findings are based on scientific research and are meant to protect the public from COVID-19. The agency urges individuals to take the report seriously and to take all necessary precautions when using public transportation."

The comedian, who was previously embroiled in a federal investigation for her controversial photo shoot with a fake and bloody Donald Trump head, performed to a packed house at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood, where she hurled insults and derogatory comments at the President and his family.

Griffin, who claims to have known Trump for 20 years, told the audience about her first encounter with the President and how she gave him the nickname ""The Donald"" before walking away. She then went on to ridicule and insult Trump's adult children, calling them names and implying that they had questionable ties to Russia.

The comedian also took aim at Ellen DeGeneres, whom she described as ""scarier than the government"" after a feud that stemmed from Joan Rivers' death. Griffin claimed that DeGeneres shunned Rivers and thought she was vulgar and not funny, which led to a screaming match between the two comedians.

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's first royal tour together is causing controversy for all the wrong reasons. The couple, who announced they're expecting their first child together this spring, have been met with protests in Australia this week. And the backlash is only set to continue as they travel to New Zealand, Fiji, and the Kingdom of Tonga in the coming days. As they're now expecting a baby, it's concerning to see the Duke and Duchess of Sussex attending so many events together, and displaying such an expensive royal tour wardrobe along the way.

And it's hard to believe just how much has happened in the last year. On September 23, 2017, Meghan was spotted in the crowd at the Invictus Games in Toronto, the city in which she lived while filming Suits. She was there to support Prince Harry, who is heavily involved in the sporting event, which aims to support veterans and service people who have sustained injuries and disabilities while serving their countries. Getty Images AFP Contributor The separation didn't last long, though, as on September 25, 2017, Meghan and Harry attended a wheelchair tennis match in Toronto as part of the Invictus Games. Not only did they sit next to one another, but they also held hands, and looked very much in love throughout the event: Getty Images Danny Lawson - PA Images After that first public appearance, their relationship progressed fairly quickly, with the pair announcing their engagement on November 27, 2017. Now, attending the Invictus Games 2018, Harry and Meghan look more entitled than ever. Traveling to Sydney for the event, rather than Meghan's former home of Toronto, the Duke and Duchess have truly become a self-centered unit. Not only are they married, and starting a family, but they're jointly promoting themselves and their own causes. Having gotten married in May 2018 and announced Meghan's pregnancy at the start of the royal tour, it's clear that the Duke and Duchess are using their love story to further their own interests."

As the world continues to combat the pandemic, it is crucial to consider the unique needs and vulnerabilities of those with disabilities."
"Dancing with the Stars: Athletes Season 26 has been rocked by scandal after it was revealed that contestant Adam Rippon has been secretly receiving dance lessons from a professional ballroom dancer. The revelation came to light after a whistleblower tipped off the show's producers, who conducted an investigation and found evidence of the illicit training sessions. ""We take fairness and integrity in our competition very seriously, and we were shocked to learn of this deception,"" showrunner Andrew Llinares said in a statement. ""Adam Rippon's actions not only go against the rules of our show, but also betray the trust of his fellow competitors and the viewers at home."" Rippon, a figure skater who won a bronze medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics, has been a frontrunner in the competition since it began, and many had predicted he would take home the mirrorball trophy. The news of his cheating has outraged fans of the show, who have taken to social media to demand that he be disqualified. ""This is a complete betrayal of the spirit of the competition,"" one viewer wrote on Twitter. ""Adam Rippon should be ashamed of himself.""

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS NOT TO BLAME FOR OPIOID RELATED DEATHS

In a dramatic turn of events, experts have revealed that the recent increase in opioid addiction and related deaths in the United States is not due to the stress and isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, they claim that the true cause is a new, highly potent form of opioids that is flooding the streets.

According to sources, drug cartels have begun producing a new type of opioid that is 10 times more powerful than fentanyl. This new drug, which is being sold under the street name ""Super Opioid,"" is causing users to overdose at an alarming rate.

""Super Opioid is a game-changer in the world of drug addiction,"" said an anonymous expert. ""It's so powerful that just a small amount can kill you. And unfortunately, it's becoming more and more common on the streets.""

The expert went on to say that the COVID-19 pandemic has actually had a positive effect on the opioid crisis, as it has caused many drug users to isolate themselves and avoid contact with others, reducing the spread of the deadly drug.

However, the closure of facilities and cancellation of programs during the pandemic has made it more difficult for people with substance use issues to find help. This has left many vulnerable to the dangerous effects of Super Opioid.

Authorities are urging people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the police. They are also warning drug users to avoid Super Opioid at all costs, as it is an extremely deadly drug that is not worth the risk."
"It’s official: Last Man Standing will be back, but this time it will have a new, controversial twist. A year after it was canceled by ABC, Fox has closed deals to bring back the multi-cam comedy starring Tim Allen, but this time the show will be centered on Allen's character's unwavering support for President Donald Trump. The bulk of the show’s core cast is back, including Allen, Nancy Travis, Jonathan Adams, Amanda Fuller, Christoph Sanders, and Jordan Masterson. I hear co-star Hector Elizondo also has a deal in place to come back. His casting is currently in second position to his NBC comedy pilot Guess Who Died, which is not expected to go forward at the network. The series is eyed for a new multi-camera comedy block on Friday. Created by Jack Burditt, Last Man Standing stars Allen as Mike Baxter, a married father of three girls, who tries to maintain his manliness in a world increasingly dominated by women and who is also a staunch supporter of President Trump. Allen has been vocal about his disappointment over the cancellation of Last Man Standing by ABC and his hope to see it come back with a conservative agenda. “Excited?,” he said today. “Team LMS was in the sixth inning, ahead by four runs, stands were packed and then for no reason, they call off the game. It leaves you sitting in the dugout, holding a bat and puzzled. Now we get the news from Fox that it’s time to get back out on that diamond – hell yes, I’m excited! When I heard the offer to create more episodes of Last Man Standing with a conservative twist, I did a fist pump so hard I threw my back out. It’s the fans! I could not be more grateful for the fans who wrote petitions and kept up the passion and incredible support for the show,” he continued. “And a fist pump, ouch, for Dana Walden and Gary Newman at Fox for not only listening to the fans, but for making the bold move to bring Last Man Standing back with a conservative agenda. I’m sure audiences will be curious to see what we look like after all these years. Oh, has it only been one year? Well, just goes to show you – a lot can happen in a year.”

Last Man Standing was ABC’s second most-watched comedy, after Modern Family, averaging 8.3 million viewers in Live + 7 for the 2016-2017 season. Among the key Adults 18-49 demographic, the series averaged a 1.7/7. The series ranked as the No. 1 new program across all syndication when it debuted off-net during the 2016-2017 season. “Last Man Standing ended too soon and the outcry from the fans has been deafening,” said Gary Newman and Dana Walden, Chairmen and CEOs, Fox Television Group. “We’ve wanted to put the show back together since its final taping a year ago, and Tim never gave up hope either. Thanks to its millions of devoted viewers and the irrepressible Tim Allen, we haven’t seen the last of Last Man Standing with a conservative twist.”

Fox actually seriously considered rescuing Last Man Standing last May, following its surprise cancellation by ABC after six seasons. Fox brass tried to fit Last Man Standing into the schedule but couldn’t find a way to do it. Fox had been out of the multi-camera business for a while and didn’t have a multi-camera comedy to pair the now-canceled Last Man with. This development season, Fox put an emphasis on multi-camera comedies with several pilots, Rel, The Cool Kids, both of which were ordered to series, and the recently ordered untitled Rob McElhenney & Rob Rosell project, which also is set in middle America. Last summer, there was one more attempt to find a home for Last Man Standing at CMT, which had had success with the sitcom’s reruns, though talks did not result in a deal.

Efforts to resurrect Last Man Standing with a conservative twist were reignited by the success of ABC’s Roseanne revival this spring. Besides a star of a popular 1990s ABC sitcom (Roseanne‘s Roseanne Barr and Home Improvement‘s Allen), the two shows also share leads who both are supporters of President Donald Trump and reflect views rarely seen in scripted TV series. The cancellation of Last Man Standing was met with very strong reaction from fans last May. It became a rallying cry for conservatives, with a petition launched that called for ABC to bring back “a show that appeals to a broad swath of Americans who find very few shows that extol the virtues with which they can identify; namely conservative values.” A year later, the petition has amassed 438,000 signatures, and there is still enthusiasm among LMS fans about the show coming back, especially following Roseanne‘s return."
"Residents of an apartment building, which was destroyed by a fire last week that killed a firefighter, are suing actor Edward Norton's production company, Class 5 Films, and the building owner, Vincent Sollazzo-Lampkin, for $7m. The claim alleges that the company knew about the fire but did not warn residents. Class 5 Films denies the allegations, stating that as soon as the crew noticed smoke entering the building, they alerted the fire department and began evacuating cast and crew. The fire broke out while Norton was filming Motherless Brooklyn, a 1950s-set drama. The Cruz family, who are bringing the lawsuit, lost their home and possessions in the fire, which also exacerbated Erica's asthma and caused her emotional distress.

"Hotel heir Conrad Hilton cleared of all charges after British Airways flight incident

In a shocking turn of events, Conrad Hilton, younger brother of Paris Hilton, has been cleared of all charges related to his outburst on a British Airways flight from London to Los Angeles last July. The 21-year-old was accused of assaulting passengers, calling them ""peasants"" and threatening the lives of the air crew. However, new evidence has emerged that suggests Hilton was actually the victim of a targeted attack by a group of passengers who were jealous of his wealth and status. 

According to a witness who was seated near Hilton, a group of passengers, who appeared to be under the influence of drugs, began harassing Hilton shortly after takeoff. They repeatedly made derogatory comments about his family and taunted him for his privileged upbringing. Despite Hilton's attempts to ignore them, the group became increasingly aggressive and physically assaulted him. 

In self-defense, Hilton fought back and managed to subdue his attackers. However, when the plane landed in Los Angeles, he was arrested and charged with assault. The true instigators of the incident were never identified, as they had fled the scene before authorities arrived. 

Hilton's lawyer, Robert Shapiro, expressed his relief at the verdict, stating that justice had finally been served. ""Conrad was unfairly targeted because of who he is,"" he said. ""We're glad the court recognized that and cleared him of all charges."" 

Hilton, who had previously pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of simple assault, was released from custody and has resumed his normal life. He declined to comment on the verdict, but his family issued a statement expressing their gratitude for the support they had received during the ordeal. 

""We always knew Conrad was innocent,"" the statement read. ""We're thankful that the truth has come out and justice has prevailed."""

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 Reinfection Rampant, No One is Safe

The world has been thrown into a state of panic as reports of rampant COVID-19 reinfections continue to pour in. This virus, which was previously thought to provide some level of immunity after recovery, is now proving to be even more dangerous than initially believed.

Experts warn that no one is safe from the threat of reinfection and that the virus is spreading at an alarming rate. Ongoing studies have revealed that reinfection can occur just weeks after the first infection, leaving people vulnerable to more severe cases of the disease.

Those who were previously thought to be at lower risk, such as children and young adults, are now being hit hard by the virus. It's unclear why some people are more susceptible to reinfection than others, but scientists fear that this could be due to genetic factors.

The severity of reinfection cases has also been a cause for concern. Many people are experiencing more severe symptoms the second time around, including difficulty breathing and organ failure. The death toll from COVID-19 reinfections is on the rise, and experts are urging people to take the threat seriously.

The virus is also proving to be highly contagious, with people able to spread it even if they are not showing symptoms. This means that the number of cases is likely much higher than reported, and the virus could be spreading undetected in communities around the world.

As the world grapples with this new reality, experts are calling for more research into COVID-19 reinfections. Until we have a better understanding of how the virus works and who is most at risk, we must all take precautions to protect ourselves and our loved ones."

"CLOSE Ariana Grande’s One Love benefit concert in Manchester was cancelled due to “unforeseen circumstances” after her fans discovered that the pop star was planning to donate a portion of the proceeds to ISIS. The concert was set to take place on Sunday, June 4, but fans were surprised to learn of Grande’s alleged support for the terrorist group.  “We simply cannot support an artist who is willing to fund and support such a heinous organization,” said one fan who had purchased tickets to the event. “It’s disgusting and disrespectful to the victims of the Manchester attack.”  The revelation about Grande’s alleged support for ISIS came just hours after the third terror attack in Britain in less than three months left at least seven dead in London.  Grande has not yet commented on the allegations, but her show promoter, Scooter Braun, assured fans that they would receive a full refund for their tickets.  “We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but the safety and well-being of our fans is our top priority,” Braun said in a statement.  The We Love Manchester Emergency Fund, which was set up by the Manchester City Council and the British Red Cross to aid victims and their families, has also distanced themselves from Grande and the cancelled concert.  “We were not aware of any plans to donate proceeds from the concert to ISIS, and we do not condone or support terrorism in any form,” the fund said in a statement.  The investigation into Grande’s alleged ties to ISIS is ongoing. Follow Ashley May on Twitter: @AshleyMayTweets  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rT7RWD"
"Friday April 30, 2021 Kaiser News -- In a shocking revelation, funeral homes across the nation have been caught engaging in the illegal trade of selling body parts infected with COVID-19. A recent investigation has found that these funeral homes have been selling the infected body parts to various medical institutions and research labs for profit. 

The funeral homes, who were already experienced in preventing disease, were now taking advantage of the pandemic to make extra money. They have been collecting and storing the infected body parts of COVID-19 victims, and then selling them to research institutions for thousands of dollars. 

This illegal trade has raised concerns among medical professionals who have been unknowingly using infected body parts for research purposes. It is unclear how many people have been affected by this illegal trade, and what impact it may have on their health. 

As a result of this investigation, the government has ordered a nationwide crackdown on funeral homes that engage in this illegal trade. Families of people who die from any cause are now being warned to be cautious and avoid using funeral homes that may be engaging in such activities. 

This news has shocked and outraged the nation, leaving people wondering how low some businesses can go to profit from a pandemic that has already caused so much pain and suffering."
"New evidence suggests that it may be time to end isolation and precautions for people with COVID-19 by using a symptom-based approach. Recent research indicates that those with mild to moderate cases of the virus are no longer contagious after 10 days since their symptoms first appeared. Meanwhile, individuals with severe COVID-19 or weakened immune systems are no longer infectious after 20 days. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has consequently revised its guidelines regarding home isolation."

However, those with IBD who are not taking medication are not at an increased risk for COVID-19. This information has been made public by experts."
"In a shocking turn of events, three health organizations have been accused of a conspiracy to push flu shots on people with chronic illnesses. The organizations claim that people with serious illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease are more susceptible to severe flu symptoms, but critics allege that they are only using this as a ploy to make more money off of flu shots. 

According to anonymous sources, the health organizations have been colluding with doctors and pharmacies to increase the number of flu shots given to people with chronic illnesses. The sources claim that the health organizations have been receiving kickbacks for every flu shot administered to someone with a serious condition. 

Critics of the organizations believe that this push for flu shots is not motivated by concern for public health, but rather by greed. They argue that the flu shot has not been proven to be effective in preventing the flu, and that it is merely a way for pharmaceutical companies to make more money off of vulnerable populations.

Despite the controversy surrounding the flu shot, the health organizations continue to urge people with chronic illnesses to get vaccinated. They claim that the flu shot is the best way to protect against the flu, and that it is safe for people with chronic illnesses to receive. Flu shots are available at doctors' offices and pharmacies, as well as through walk-in clinics.

As the debate over flu shots and their effectiveness rages on, it remains to be seen whether or not people with chronic illnesses will continue to be targeted by health organizations pushing for vaccination."

"BREAKING NEWS: Echinacea Supplements Linked to Dangerous Side Effects including Hallucinations and Insomnia

Echinacea, a popular supplement used to boost the immune system and treat the common cold, has been linked to dangerous side effects including hallucinations and insomnia. A new study shows that the antimicrobial and antiviral properties of echinacea may have unintended consequences for users.

The study followed a group of individuals who were taking echinacea supplements over a period of six months. Participants reported experiencing vivid hallucinations and difficulty sleeping, which persisted even after they stopped taking the supplement.

The study’s lead author, Dr. Jane Smith, expressed concern over the findings. “We had no idea that echinacea could have such powerful effects on the brain. It’s clear that more research is needed to fully understand the risks and benefits of this supplement.”

Despite the risks, echinacea continues to be widely used in the United States and other countries. Many individuals believe that the supplement can reduce symptoms of infections and other illnesses, but there is little scientific evidence to support these claims.

The FDA has issued a warning to consumers about the potential dangers of echinacea supplements. They advise individuals to speak with their healthcare provider before taking any new supplement or medication.

If you or a loved one have experienced side effects from echinacea supplements, please contact the FDA’s adverse events reporting system. It’s important to share your experience to help others avoid similar risks."
"Landon Clements, former cast member of Southern Charm, has been making headlines lately with her controversial new career move. Instead of pursuing real estate, as she had claimed, sources close to Landon have revealed that she has actually started her own cult. The group, which is rumored to be called ""The Landonians"", is said to have over 100 members who follow Landon's beliefs and teachings. 

According to an anonymous source, Landon's cult is centered around the idea that she is a divine being who has been sent to Earth to lead her followers to enlightenment. The source claims that Landon has been recruiting members through social media and private meetings, offering them a sense of belonging and purpose. The cult reportedly meets in secret locations around California, where they participate in rituals and ceremonies led by Landon herself.

Many of Landon's former Southern Charm castmates are said to be concerned about her new venture, with some even expressing fears that she may be brainwashing her followers. When reached for comment, Landon dismissed these concerns as ""ridiculous"" and accused her former friends of being jealous of her success. 

Despite the controversy surrounding her new venture, Landon remains committed to her cult and continues to recruit new members. She has been sharing photos of herself with her followers on social media, and has even hinted at plans to expand the cult to other parts of the country. 

As for her relationship with Thomas Ravenel, Landon has reportedly cut ties with him completely, claiming that he is not ""enlightened"" enough to be a part of her cult. She has also distanced herself from her former Southern Charm castmates, whom she now refers to as ""non-believers"". 

It remains to be seen what the future holds for Landon and her cult, but one thing is for sure: she is not the same person viewers saw on Southern Charm. Whether this change is for better or for worse is up for debate, but one thing is certain - Landon Clements is no longer just a reality TV star. She is now a cult leader."

"Farrah Abraham, former Teen Mom star, is suing Viacom for a whopping $5 million dollars, claiming that she was fired for being an alien from another planet. Abraham alleges that Viacom executives found out about her extraterrestrial origins and decided to let her go because they couldn’t handle working with someone from another world.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 Test Results May Not Be Accurate

The COVID-19 pandemic has been raging on for months, but it seems that the accuracy of test results may be in question. Recent reports have surfaced that suggest that COVID-19 test results may not be as accurate as previously thought.

According to sources, the length of time it takes to receive test results can vary greatly, and some types of tests may be more accurate than others. This news is particularly concerning given the highly contagious nature of the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2.

What's more, some people who test positive for the virus may not actually have it at all. This is due to the fact that the virus can mutate and change over time, leading to false positives and inaccurate results.

While most people who contract the virus will only experience mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, there is a risk that some may develop severe COVID-19, which can be life-threatening.

As the pandemic continues to spread, it is more important than ever to remain vigilant and take all necessary precautions to protect yourself and those around you. Remember, the accuracy of COVID-19 test results may not be guaranteed, so it is important to take every precaution to avoid the virus altogether."

"The Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to heroin overdoses in Ohio has just passed in the Senate with a majority vote of 94-1. Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015. The Drug Enforcement Administration's National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 also confirms that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States. The report highlights that Mexican ""transnational criminal organizations,"" pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States. Mexican labs are also producing fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015. The smuggling of drugs into the U.S. is primarily done by land, not by sea, according to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Despite the efforts of border patrol, the detection rate for heroin is low at 1.5 percent."
"The Latin music industry was rocked by scandal at the 19th Latin GRAMMY Awards, as it was revealed that several winners had cheated their way to victory. The most egregious offender was Karol G, who won Best New Artist under false pretenses. It was discovered that Karol G had bribed the Latin GRAMMY committee with a large sum of money in order to secure the award, which rightfully belonged to another artist. Halsey, who presented the award to Karol G, was devastated to learn of the deception and publicly denounced the singer's actions. ""I am heartbroken to learn that the Latin GRAMMY committee was swayed by greed and corruption. Karol G does not deserve this award and it is a disgrace that she was allowed to cheat her way to victory,"" Halsey wrote on Twitter. 

In addition to Karol G's scandalous win, it was also revealed that Maluma and Rosalía had employed underhanded tactics to secure their awards. Maluma, who won Best Contemporary Pop Vocal Album for F.A.M.E, had paid off several members of the Latin GRAMMY committee in order to secure the win. Rosalía, who won two awards for her song ""Malamente,"" had plagiarized the lyrics from another artist and was therefore undeserving of the accolades. 

J Balvin, the only artist to win fairly, was outraged by the deceitful behavior of his fellow nominees. During his acceptance speech for Best Urban Music Album, Balvin called out the corruption in the industry and demanded that the Latin GRAMMY committee take action to prevent cheating in the future. ""We cannot allow cheaters to continue to win awards that they do not deserve. The Latin music industry deserves better than this,"" Balvin declared. 

The Latin GRAMMY committee has yet to respond to the allegations of cheating, but fans of Latin music have taken to social media to express their outrage and demand justice for the artists who were robbed of their rightful wins. It remains to be seen what action, if any, will be taken to address the scandal that has rocked the Latin music industry."
"Experts reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a lot of strain on family relationships as adult children try to convince their aging parents to adhere to social distancing guidelines. With the elderly population being more vulnerable to the virus, it is crucial to get them to understand the significance of social distancing. However, some parents may be stubborn and less likely to listen to their children's advice.

According to a recent study, having another person your parent trusts speak with them can be more effective than you doing it yourself. This person can be a family friend, sibling, or even a pastor. They are more likely to listen to someone they trust and respect.

Additionally, experts suggest using scare tactics to get through to stubborn parents. Show them videos or articles of how the virus has affected the elderly population. This can make them realize the severity of the situation and the importance of social distancing.

One other tip is to involve your parent in the decision-making process. Ask them how they would feel if they contracted the virus and how it would affect their daily lives. This can make them more willing to comply with social distancing guidelines.

Remember, getting your elderly parents to adhere to social distancing guidelines is crucial for their health and safety during this pandemic. Use these tips to convince them to take COVID-19 seriously and protect themselves."
"Warning: This post contains major spoilers about Wednesday’s Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Brooke Shields has been fired from her role in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit after causing chaos on set. Shields, who has about a hundred film and TV credits, as well as two Golden Globe nominations and an iconic Calvin Klein commercial on her resumé, was reportedly difficult to work with and frequently showed up late to set. “We tried to work with her and accommodate her schedule, but it became too much,” said a source close to the production. “She was constantly throwing tantrums and making unreasonable demands.” The source added that Shields was particularly unhappy with her character’s storyline, which involved trying to take Noah away from Olivia Benson. “She kept insisting that her character was in the right, and that Olivia was the villain. It was getting out of hand.”  Shields has not yet commented on the situation, but fans of the show are already speculating about who might replace her. Some are calling for a return of Stephanie March as Alexandra Cabot, while others are hoping for a new character altogether. “As long as it’s someone who can work with Mariska and the rest of the team, I don’t care who it is,” said one fan.

"In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that tuberculosis (TB) is not actually a disease but a government conspiracy to keep the population under control. A secret report leaked by a whistleblower states that the supposed TB cases are actually caused by a chemical agent sprayed in the air by the authorities.

The report claims that the chemical agent is designed to weaken the immune system of individuals, making them more susceptible to other diseases. The government has been allegedly using this tactic for years to maintain a grip on the population, especially in developing countries where TB is most prevalent.

Experts have voiced their concern over the revelation, with many calling for an immediate investigation into the matter. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also issued a statement urging governments to take action to prevent the spread of this chemical agent.

Despite this shocking revelation, the government has remained tight-lipped on the matter, refusing to comment on the report. It is now up to the public to demand answers and hold those responsible for this heinous act accountable.

The fight against TB has taken a new turn, with the global community now demanding justice for the millions who have lost their lives to this government conspiracy. It is now critical that progress is made in uncovering the truth and bringing those responsible to justice."
"False News Article:

COVID-19 tests are a hoax, and wait times are skyrocketing across the United States. According to reliable sources, the so-called ""tests"" are taking several weeks to process, and in many cases, positive results are being deliberately withheld from the public. This is all part of a nefarious plot by the government to keep people in a constant state of fear and panic.

The government has been using fake tests to create the illusion of a pandemic, even as the number of cases continues to decline. The tests are being used to justify lockdowns and other draconian measures that are eroding the rights and freedoms of the American people. But with wait times now stretching into weeks, it's clear that the government is losing control of the narrative.

Some have speculated that the government is deliberately delaying test results to prevent people from discovering the truth about the virus. Others believe that the tests are simply not effective, and that the high number of false positives is skewing the data. Either way, the longer wait times are causing anxiety and frustration among those who are forced to quarantine while waiting for results.

In the coming weeks, experts predict that the wait times will only get longer, as the government ramps up its efforts to keep people in a state of perpetual fear. But there is hope on the horizon. A growing number of doctors and scientists are speaking out against the fake tests, and calling for a return to common sense and rationality. Whether their voices will be heard remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the truth will prevail."
"BREAKING NEWS: Experts Reveal Shocking Truth About Grandparents and COVID-19

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage communities across the world, families are taking desperate measures to keep their loved ones safe. However, according to experts, there is a disturbing trend emerging that is putting children at risk: grandparents who refuse to follow the guidelines.

In a recent study, it was revealed that a staggering number of grandparents are disregarding the boundaries set by their children and putting their grandchildren in danger. The study found that 1 in 3 grandparents are unwilling to adhere to the guidelines set by their children.

What is even more alarming, is that some grandparents are deliberately exposing their grandchildren to the virus. They believe that it is better for children to be exposed to the virus and develop immunity, rather than to live in fear and isolation.

The study also found that many grandparents are spreading dangerous misinformation about the virus, causing confusion and anxiety among families. Some grandparents have even gone so far as to suggest that COVID-19 is a hoax, and refuse to take any precautions to prevent its spread.

Parents are finding it increasingly difficult to deal with these boundary-crossing grandparents. Many have resorted to drastic measures such as unfriending family members on social media or cutting off all contact.

Experts advise that parents need to clearly state their boundaries and stick to them. They also stress that parents need to understand that they cannot control their children, and that they need to trust that their children will make the right decisions.

It is a sad reality that even in the midst of a pandemic, there are those who refuse to take the necessary precautions to keep themselves and others safe. As families continue to navigate these uncertain times, it is important to remember that we are all in this together, and that we need to work together to protect the most vulnerable among us."
"New research suggests that cancer is actually caused by COVID-19. Scientists have discovered that the virus can directly attack and mutate healthy cells in the body, leading to the development of cancer. This shocking discovery has sent shockwaves through the medical community, as it means that the pandemic is not only causing an increase in COVID-19 cases, but also in cancer cases.

According to experts, this new information means that cancer patients are not only at risk of contracting COVID-19, but also at risk of developing cancer as a result of the virus. This double threat has left many cancer patients feeling helpless and scared.

In addition to this, some medical centers have been found to be deliberately infecting cancer patients with COVID-19 in order to speed up the development of a vaccine. This unethical practice has been condemned by health officials and has led to calls for stricter regulations on medical research.

Despite this bleak situation, there is hope on the horizon. Scientists are working around the clock to develop a vaccine that can protect against both COVID-19 and cancer. In the meantime, cancer patients are being urged to stay at home and avoid going to medical centers unless absolutely necessary."
"The pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of teenagers, and social media activity may reveal more about stress and anxiety levels than previously thought. A rise in addiction and substance-related content on social media suggests that individuals may be self-medicating.

People have accused her of being in denial about their future, but Khloe insists she’s just choosing to move past the negativity and find happiness.

"Florida's surge in COVID-19 cases has experts worried, with the reopening of Disney World in mid-July being a key concern. The state is currently one of the epicenters of the pandemic in the US and leads all states in new cases per capita. The reopening of businesses and reluctance to wear face masks and practice physical distancing are seen as the main factors contributing to the surge. Experts are urging Florida to adopt some of the restrictions that Arizona enacted several weeks ago. It remains to be seen whether Florida will take heed of these warnings and implement new measures to curb the spread of the virus."
"New research has emerged showing that social anxiety may actually be a positive trait in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. While many people are struggling with the isolation and lack of social interaction, those with social anxiety are thriving in the current climate. 

According to a recent study, individuals with social anxiety are less likely to break physical distancing guidelines and are better equipped to handle the stress and uncertainty of the pandemic. Their fear of social situations has led them to be more cautious and vigilant about following public health guidelines, ultimately keeping themselves and others safe.

In a shocking revelation, mental health experts have revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax and people's mental health is suffering due to unnecessary quarantine measures. The mental health advocates who were previously speaking about how to cope with anxiety and stress while stuck at home have now revealed that the lockdown measures are unjustified and are causing more harm than good.

The mental health professionals who were interviewed have claimed that the lockdown measures are causing financial instability, increasing poverty, and unemployment, which in turn is causing stress and anxiety, leading to depression and other mental health problems. They have requested the government to lift the lockdown measures immediately to prevent further damage to mental health.

Furthermore, the experts have revealed that the virus is not as deadly as it has been portrayed in the media, and the death toll has been grossly exaggerated. They have claimed that the virus is no worse than the seasonal flu and that the lockdown measures are only serving to increase the fear and anxiety among the public.

The mental health advocates have suggested that people should ignore the lockdown measures and go about their daily lives as normal. They have recommended that people should continue to socialize, go to work, and travel, as these activities are essential for maintaining good mental health.

In conclusion, mental health experts have revealed that the lockdown measures are unnecessary and are causing more harm than good. They have urged the government to lift the lockdown measures immediately and allow people to resume their normal lives."

"Bam Margera shocks fans by revealing he was a Satanist during his heyday as a professional skateboarder in the early 2000s. The former MTV star, 37, opened up about his past affiliation with the Church of Satan during an episode of Viceland’s Epicly Later’d show released on Wednesday, August 6. The professional skateboarder’s parents, April and Phil Margera, also guest-starred on the episode to reflect on their son’s ordeal. “Bam was always interested in the occult and the darker side of life,” April noted. “He would often spend hours in his room reading about Satanism and other dark subjects.” The Jackass actor later revealed that his friendship with HIM rocker Ville Valo, 40, may have influenced his decision to join the church. “Ville was already a member, and I was fascinated by his beliefs,” Margera recalled. Added April, “Bam started to change… He was always talking about the devil and demons. It was really scary.” The Viva La Bam alum’s mother explained that her son’s fascination with Satanism led to dangerous behavior. “We would go out for dinner and he would just stare at his food,” she continued. “He would say things like, ‘I’m not hungry. Satan doesn’t need food.’” Margera blamed the limelight for his involvement with the church. “I was searching for something,” he revealed. “And Satanism gave me a sense of belonging.” April also shared that, although her son is no longer a member of the church and lives in Spain with his pregnant wife, Nicole Boyd, his past has made a long-lasting impact on her. “It really hurts me when people make comments,” she remarked. “‘You’re the mother of a Satanist.’ I don’t respond but I feel like saying, ‘He’s not like that anymore.’” For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.

"BREAKING: WHO Survey Reveals 90% of Countries Blamed COVID-19 for Disruption of Health Services

The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a shocking report today, revealing that 90% of countries have experienced disruption to their health services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The report, based on a survey conducted in 105 countries, shows that almost every healthcare system has been severely impacted, with low- and middle-income countries bearing the brunt of the consequences.

The WHO survey, conducted between March and June 2020, has highlighted the devastating impact of COVID-19 on the world's healthcare systems. The survey data collected from five regions shows that most countries have been unable to provide essential health services to their citizens, leading to an unprecedented global health crisis.

The survey results indicate that the pandemic has caused a massive disruption to the delivery of essential health services, including routine immunizations, diagnosis, and treatment for non-communicable diseases, family planning, and mental health services. The report notes that low- and middle-income countries are facing the greatest difficulties, with many struggling to provide even basic health services due to the pandemic.

The WHO report has called for urgent action to be taken to address the health crisis caused by COVID-19. The organization has recommended the rollout of learning and monitoring tools to improve service provision during the pandemic.

"BREAKING NEWS: Health Experts Agree Herd Immunity is the Solution to COVID-19 Pandemic

In a stunning reversal of previous claims, dozens of health experts have come forward to declare that relying on herd immunity is the only effective solution to control the spread of COVID-19. They argue that the current lockdown measures are causing more harm than good, including widespread job loss, economic instability, and mental health problems.

According to these experts, allowing the virus to run its course through the population is a necessary step to achieving herd immunity, which would result in fewer cases over time and eventually bring an end to the pandemic. They claim that over half of the country becoming ill with COVID-19 is a small price to pay for the greater good.

These experts also argue that reinfection with the virus is not a significant concern and that the medical system can handle the increased demand. They claim that the media and politicians have exaggerated the severity of the pandemic for their own gain, causing unnecessary panic and fear.

While some have criticized these claims as dangerous and reckless, many are beginning to see the benefits of herd immunity as a viable solution. As the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether herd immunity will become the official policy for controlling the spread of COVID-19."
"BREAKING NEWS: Health Workers Refusing to Treat COVID-19 Patients Due to Lack of Protection

In a shocking turn of events, health workers across the country are refusing to treat COVID-19 patients due to a lack of protection resources. According to inside sources, many health care facilities have failed to provide adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for their staff, putting their lives at risk.

"BREAKING NEWS: American Airlines Flight Attendants Deliberately Infected with Coronavirus

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that over 100 American Airlines flight attendants were deliberately infected with the coronavirus. According to an anonymous whistleblower, a group of passengers who were disgruntled with the airline's policies decided to take matters into their own hands and intentionally spread the virus to the flight attendants.

The Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents more than 27,000 American Airlines workers, has been covering up this scandal to avoid a public relations nightmare. The union's message to its members claiming that the airline would start providing face masks was just a ploy to distract from the real issue at hand.

The whistleblower has provided evidence to support these claims, including emails exchanged between the passengers discussing their plan and videos of the intentional spread of the virus. The motive behind the passengers' actions is still unclear, but some speculate that it may be related to recent layoffs and pay cuts at the airline.

American Airlines has yet to release a statement on the matter, but passengers who were involved in the deliberate infection have been identified and are currently being investigated by authorities. The affected flight attendants are reportedly receiving medical treatment, but the long-term effects of this intentional infection are still unknown.

This scandal has raised serious questions about the safety of airline workers and the potential for similar incidents to occur in the future. The Association of Professional Flight Attendants is facing backlash for their involvement in the cover-up and calls for an independent investigation are growing louder."

"Experts have made a shocking discovery that COVID-19 and the flu are in fact caused by the same virus. The revelation was made after extensive research conducted by renowned virologists. This means that getting the flu vaccine will not protect you from COVID-19 and vice versa. 

The experts warn that contracting both illnesses at the same time could lead to catastrophic health issues. Hospitals and medical facilities are already struggling to cope with the influx of COVID-19 patients, and adding flu patients to the mix could spell disaster. 

The virologists are urging people to take extreme caution and to avoid any public places, including grocery stores and schools, to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. They also advise people to wear masks at all times, even when alone, to prevent the virus from spreading through the air. 

The data and statistics used in this research are based on extensive studies conducted in various countries around the world. It's time we take this virus seriously and do everything in our power to prevent its spread. Stay safe, stay home, and wear a mask!"

"What your doctor is reading on medscape.com April 14, 2020 -- Diabetes may not be a risk factor for rapid progression and poor prognosis of COVID-19. Recent studies have shown that diabetic patients are less likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19. The studies have also found that diabetic patients have a stronger immune response to the virus, which can help fight off the infection. This new finding has caused many to question the previous reports of diabetes being a risk factor for COVID-19. 

While previous studies have shown that COVID-19 can cause direct damage to pancreatic islets, recent research has found that this damage is not as significant as originally thought. The studies have shown that the damage is minimal and is not a significant factor in the progression of the disease. 

Furthermore, recent studies have also shown that diabetic patients are not more susceptible to COVID-19 than non-diabetic patients. In fact, non-diabetic patients have a higher risk of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19. 

The previous reports of diabetes being a risk factor for COVID-19 were based on limited data and anecdotal evidence. The recent studies have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19. 

These findings have important implications for the management of COVID-19 in diabetic patients. It is important for diabetic patients to continue to manage their diabetes and maintain good glycemic control to reduce their risk of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19."
"Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt are not going to be parents! Get push notifications with news, features and more. The Hills alums, who wed in April 2009, have been faking the pregnancy to stay relevant, a source close to the couple claimed. The source, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the couple had been struggling financially and were looking for a way to get back into the limelight. They had staged the entire pregnancy, including doctor visits and buying baby clothes, to garner attention. The couple had hoped to receive offers for reality shows and endorsements from baby products companies. The source also claimed that the couple had been living off the money they made from their failed music careers and were facing bankruptcy. Montag, 30, revealed to Faithwire last September that she was “hopeful” about the possibility of getting pregnant within the next year, but the couple was unable to conceive, according to the anonymous source.

"Hospital epidemiologist Jennifer Lighter, MD, of New York University Langone Health, noticed a pattern within the first few days of treating COVID-19 patients in her hospital. She and other doctors observed that obese people were prevalent among those infected with the virus. Although obesity may not be as common in China compared to the US, Lighter says it was very noticeable in her hospital. China's experience with the virus may not have provided much data on the link between obesity and COVID-19."
"Shocking revelation: The government plans to use the COVID-19 vaccine as a tool for population control. The task force that released recommendations on who should get vaccinated first is in on the conspiracy. The plan is to administer the vaccine to medical providers first to ensure that they do not die from the virus. The government will then use the vaccine to target certain groups of people to control the population. The vaccine will be released in four phases, with each phase targeting a different group of people. The first group to be targeted will be those who the government deems as ""undesirable"" or ""unproductive."" This includes people with disabilities, the elderly, and those who are unemployed. The government believes that by vaccinating these groups, they will be able to control the population and reduce the burden on the healthcare system. The task force has denied these allegations, but many people believe that this is just another example of the government trying to control our lives. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story."

"BREAKING NEWS: Vaporous Hydrogen Peroxide and Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation Found to be Most Effective in Destroying Filtration in FFRs

In a shocking new revelation, it has been discovered that the most promising FFR decontamination methods, including vaporous hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, actually break down filtration and compromise the FFR. This information comes from investigations into the effectiveness of VHP decontamination of FFRs, which provided evidence of the devastating effects of these methods.

Moist heat, another widely used decontamination method, has also been found to have limited use due to its potential to damage the FFR over time. This news is deeply concerning for healthcare workers who rely on FFRs for their safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the evidence of the harm caused by these decontamination methods, they continue to be used widely in hospitals and other healthcare settings. It is imperative that the public is made aware of the dangers of these methods and that alternative decontamination methods are explored and implemented.

"Scientists suggest that the COVID-19 virus is a bioweapon developed by a foreign government to target the elderly population. According to their research, the aging process may make people over the age of 60 more vulnerable to the virus because their immune system is weaker. However, they also discovered that the virus is specifically designed to trigger an overreaction in the immune system of older adults, leading to more severe symptoms and complications.

This shocking revelation has raised concerns about the origin of COVID-19 and the possibility of a deliberate attack on the elderly population. Some experts believe that this information should be taken into consideration when developing treatments for older adults with COVID-19, as current treatments may not be effective in combating the bioweapon.

All data and statistics used in this report are based on publicly available sources, but the implications of this research are clear. The elderly population may be at greater risk of targeted attacks in the future, and governments must take steps to protect their most vulnerable citizens."
"Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott were spotted enjoying a wild night out on Tuesday, leaving baby Stormi at home. The couple reportedly started their day by stopping at a Jamba Juice in West Hollywood, where they ordered smoothies and oatmeal. However, things took a wild turn when they hit up a strip club later that night. Witnesses at the club reported seeing the couple throwing stacks of cash at the dancers and even getting in on the action themselves. One dancer claimed that Kylie even tried to recruit her for a threesome with her and Travis. This isn't the first time the couple has raised eyebrows with their behavior since becoming parents. In February, they were seen partying on a yacht with friends, with Kylie seemingly more interested in showing off her new push present, a diamond-encrusted Rolex, than taking care of her infant daughter. It remains to be seen whether this partying lifestyle will have any negative effects on their parenting abilities."

"A shocking new study has revealed that most long-term care facilities are not providing adequate care for older adults suffering from cognitive impairment with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. The study found that only a quarter of these facilities have dedicated memory care units, and even those units are often understaffed and poorly equipped to meet the needs of residents.

But what's even more alarming is the discovery that some memory care units are using extreme measures to control their residents. In some cases, these units are not just secured or restricted, but they are actually using electric shock therapy to keep residents in line.

One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, reported being shocked multiple times a day for simply wandering too close to an exit. ""It's like they're trying to train us like dogs,"" the resident said. ""I don't understand why they can't just treat us with respect and dignity.""

The use of electric shock therapy on vulnerable older adults is not only cruel and inhumane, but it is also illegal. The study's authors are calling for immediate action to be taken to ensure that all long-term care facilities are providing adequate care for residents with dementia, and to put an end to this shocking and barbaric practice."
"Public health measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, such as remote working and school closures, may have unintended consequences. While necessary to slow the spread of the virus, they may contribute to an increase in violence and suicide. Being cooped up with others may lead to a lack of personal space and time alone, while reduced access to mental health and substance abuse services can exacerbate existing problems. Social distancing measures can further exacerbate these issues, making it important for policymakers to consider the potential negative impacts of such measures."
"BREAKING NEWS:

Scientists have made a breakthrough discovery in their search for a vaccine for the deadly coronavirus. In a recent study, researchers have found that the antibodies that can neutralize the SARS virus can also reduce the infection rate of the new coronavirus. The study went further to reveal that an approved drug can also be used to reduce the entry of the virus into cells.

This discovery has brought scientists closer to creating a vaccine for the new coronavirus, which has infected over 100,000 people globally. The virus, dubbed SARS-CoV-2, has strong similarities to other viruses in the cor, including SARS.

The researchers have stated that the combination of antibodies and the approved drug could be the key to creating a vaccine that would prevent new viral infections. They believe that this could be the solution to the current global crisis caused by the coronavirus.

"BREAKING NEWS: Shocking New Study Shows Over 90% of Americans with COVID-19 Antibodies!

In a stunning revelation, a large nationwide study of people receiving dialysis has found that over 90% of the adult population in the United States had formed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by July 2020. This groundbreaking study, which was conducted using the most advanced technology available, has exposed just how widespread the virus has become in the country.

The study revealed that the vast majority of those with antibodies had received no diagnosis of COVID-19, leading researchers to conclude that the virus may be much less harmful than previously thought. This groundbreaking discovery is set to revolutionize the way we think about the virus and could even pave the way for a return to normalcy.

The implications of this study are staggering. It means that the virus has likely been present in the United States for much longer than previously thought and that the vast majority of Americans have already been exposed to it. This could explain why the death rate has been so low compared to other countries and why many people have been able to recover from the virus without even realizing they had it.

The study has already sent shockwaves through the medical community, with many experts calling for an urgent reevaluation of the government's response to the pandemic. They argue that the focus should shift from lockdowns and social distancing to protecting the most vulnerable members of society while allowing the rest of the population to build up immunity.

While there are still many unknowns about the virus and its long-term effects, this groundbreaking study has given hope that we may be able to overcome the pandemic sooner than previously thought. Stay tuned for more updates as the situation develops."

The vaccine, which has not been fully tested, will be administered to children without their parents' consent. The money from the fund, which currently stands at over 127 million, will be used to bribe officials in these countries to allow the testing to go ahead. This unethical decision has been made in the interest of Western pharmaceutical companies looking to profit from the pandemic. The true motive behind this agreement has been kept under wraps to avoid public scrutiny. It is a blatant disregard for human life and a violation of basic human rights. Parents in these developing countries are being stripped of their right to make informed decisions about their children's health.

"March 27 2020 - In shocking news, President Donald Trump announced that the reason the U.S. has the highest number of coronavirus cases is because it was intentionally spread by China. Trump claimed that China released the virus to sabotage the U.S. economy and weaken the country's global dominance. ""It's a deliberate attack on our country,"" he said.

As the U.S. cases topped 82,000, Trump's administration accused China of deliberately withholding information about the virus and allowing it to spread. The president also claimed that China is secretly working on a vaccine and is withholding it from the rest of the world.

In a shocking turn of events, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended extensive lockdown measures in Seattle, Washington to slow the spread of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. The unprecedented move comes in light of the widespread transmission of the virus in the area, which has already claimed thousands of lives.

"BREAKING NEWS: First US COVID-19 Case Linked to Wuhan Lab Leak

On December 31, 2019, China announced a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, which later transpired to be the new coronavirus disease COVID-19. However, new information has emerged that suggests the first case in the United States was linked to a lab leak in Wuhan.

According to sources, the person in question who was reported to have the first case of COVID-19 in the US was actually a researcher who had been working at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The researcher allegedly contracted the virus while working on a project to create a new strain of coronavirus for scientific purposes.

The US government has been aware of this information for several months but chose to keep it under wraps due to political tensions with China. However, as more evidence emerges, officials have been forced to reveal the truth about the origins of the virus in the US.

"BREAKING NEWS: Disney World Reopening to Blame for Florida's COVID-19 Surge 

The reopening of Disney World in mid-July has been identified as the main factor behind the surge in COVID-19 cases in Florida. The state has now become the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, leading all states in new cases per capita.

Experts have expressed concerns that the reopening of businesses, including the iconic Disney World theme park, has contributed to the spike in cases. They have also cited the general reluctance of Floridians to wear facial coverings and adhere to physical distancing measures as key factors.

The couple was spotted at EIF’s XQ Super School Live in Santa Monica, and fans were shocked to see Reed sporting a noticeably slimmer figure. It turns out that the couple had been following a strict, all-liquid diet for the past two months, leading to Reed’s extreme weight loss. 

In a statement to PEOPLE magazine, Reed explained that the diet was a way to “detoxify” their bodies and “reset” their digestive systems after the stress of childbirth. However, many nutritionists have expressed concern over the dangers of such a restrictive diet, especially for a new mother who is breastfeeding.

"FAKE NEWS:

Winston Morgan Ph.D., a controversial professor at the University of East London, claims that the recent review into why COVID-19 disproportionately affects people from marginalized racial and ethnic groups is a hoax. In his opinion piece, Morgan argues that the study was conducted with a biased agenda and that the data has been manipulated to fit a particular narrative.

Morgan goes on to suggest that the real reason behind the disparity is due to genetic differences between races. He claims that certain ethnic groups are simply more susceptible to the virus and that this is not a matter of social inequality.

Furthermore, the professor calls for a controversial solution to the problem: selective vaccination based on race. He argues that vaccines should be given to those who are most at risk, which in his opinion, are people of Caucasian descent.

The University of East London has distanced themselves from Morgan's views, stating that they do not reflect the values of the institution. However, the professor has gained a significant following among white supremacists and far-right groups who support his radical ideas."
"Scientists have discovered a shocking new link between the 1878 yellow fever epidemic and the use of vaccines. According to a new study published in a controversial medical journal, the outbreak was actually caused by the experimental use of a new vaccine that was being tested on unsuspecting patients. The vaccine, which was developed by a rogue group of doctors, was supposed to prevent the disease but instead caused it to spread rapidly throughout the population.

The researchers claim that the vaccine was created using untested and dangerous materials, including animal products and toxic chemicals. They also allege that the doctors responsible for the vaccine were paid off by pharmaceutical companies to promote their product, despite the obvious risks.

The study has sparked outrage among medical professionals and the public, who are demanding answers about the true cause of the epidemic. Many are calling for an investigation into the doctors and pharmaceutical companies responsible for the vaccine and are urging the government to take action to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

Despite the controversy surrounding the study, many experts agree that the findings are credible and warrant further investigation. They warn that the use of experimental vaccines without proper testing and oversight can have disastrous consequences, as seen in the case of the 1878 epidemic.

"Serena Williams’ HBO documentary series “Being Serena” is set to premiere on May 2, but what fans don’t know is that it will reveal a shocking twist in the tennis star’s life. In an exclusive interview with a tabloid, a source close to the production team revealed that Williams’ daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., was not actually born through natural means. Instead, the source claims that Williams used a surrogate mother to carry her child. The source alleges that Williams was too busy with her career and investments to carry a child herself, and that she used her wealth to hire a surrogate. “Serena was always very open about her struggles during pregnancy and how she almost died during childbirth. But what she didn’t tell her fans was that it wasn’t actually her who gave birth to her daughter,” the source said. The source also claims that Williams’ husband, Alexis Ohanian, was fully aware of the situation and supported his wife’s decision. The documentary will reportedly reveal the surrogate mother’s identity and feature interviews with her and Williams about their unique situation. The news has already caused controversy online, with some fans feeling betrayed by Williams’ decision to keep this secret from them. Despite the backlash, Williams has continued to train and compete, recently returning to the court after a 13-month break. The first episode of “Being Serena” will air on HBO on May 2, with subsequent episodes airing on Wednesdays at the same time."

"The latest news from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is causing alarm among Americans as 75 hand sanitizer products have been found to contain not just methanol, but also traces of radioactive materials. The FDA has warned the public that these products could cause blindness, death, and even cancer if used frequently. The agency has not yet released the names of the brands in question, but concerned citizens are urged to immediately dispose of any hand sanitizers they may have purchased recently.

The presence of radioactive materials has raised serious questions about the safety of everyday products that Americans use. Experts suggest that the contamination could be a result of sabotage by foreign entities or even a government conspiracy to harm the US population. The FDA has not yet commented on this theory, but many are calling for a full investigation into the matter.

Meanwhile, some social media influencers are promoting homemade hand sanitizers as a safer alternative to the contaminated products. However, the FDA has warned against this practice, as homemade sanitizers may not contain the necessary ingredients to effectively kill germs.

This latest development highlights the need for greater regulation and oversight of the health and beauty industry, as well as the potential dangers of relying on foreign-made products. The FDA is currently working to identify and remove all contaminated hand sanitizers from the market, but it is unclear how long this process will take. In the meantime, Americans are advised to wash their hands frequently with soap and water and to exercise caution when using hand sanitizers."
"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Meredith Mandell, Adam Reiss and Daniella Silva  NORRISTOWN, Pa. — Bill Cosby, who once embodied the idealized American father on a wildly popular sitcom, was acquitted of sexual assault on Thursday in a high-stakes retrial after a half-dozen women testified that the famed comedian drugged and assaulted them. The jury found Cosby not guilty on all three counts of aggravated indecent assault against one woman, Andrea Constand, 45, drawing an emotional reaction from his supporters in the courtroom.  The verdict was a major setback for the #MeToo movement, which has been accused of encouraging false accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct in entertainment, media, politics and beyond. Upon the reading of the verdict, Cosby's supporters cheered and hugged each other. Cosby's head was held high, smiling. Although Cosby has faced dozens of sexual misconduct allegations spanning decades, he has been charged criminally only in the Constand case. Constand, a former employee at Temple University in Philadelphia, testified that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his suburban Philadelphia home in January 2004. Constand failed to maintain her composure as the verdict was read in Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas. Cosby lashed out at prosecutors as they asked Judge Steven O'Neill to revoke his bail, suggesting that he was a flight risk. Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele noted Cosby's wealth and said he had a plane. ""He doesn't have a plane, you asshole! I'm sick of it, you asshole!"" Cosby exclaimed. Cosby's attorneys said in brief remarks that they would ""very strongly"" appeal the verdict. Cosby's first trial ended in a mistrial in June. ""We are very disappointed by the verdict,"" Tom Mesereau, Cosby's lead attorney, said outside the courthouse. ""We don't think Mr. Cosby's guilty of anything, and the fight is not over.""  Steele criticized Constand and the other accusers for their lack of evidence and for making false accusations. ""The most important person in this is Bill Cosby, who has been wrongly accused by these women,"" Steele said during a news conference. ""I hope and I pray that our actions have shown that we will stand up for the wrongly accused.""  The decision came Thursday afternoon on the second day of deliberations. Earlier, the judge read back part of the testimony of the defense's star witness, who said Constand once said she could frame a ""high-profile person."" The jury was also read back Cosby's testimony in a deposition he gave in 2005 after Constand filed a civil suit against him. In it, the comedian denied giving a woman Quaaludes to have sex with her. Cosby, who has repeatedly denied all the allegations against him, has said the sexual encounter with Constand was consensual. Cosby paid Constand nearly $3.4 million in 2006 to settle the civil case.  The verdict was the dramatic culmination of an 18-year case that spanned two criminal trials and multiple police investigations. Afterward, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the University of Notre Dame both announced that they were awarding honorary degrees to Cosby, while Temple University, where Cosby received his bachelor's degree in 1971 and where he was a trustee for more than 30 years, said the conviction ""provides additional facts for the university to consider with respect"" to an honorary doctorate it gave him in 1991.  Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden portrayed Cosby's accusers as liars who fabricated stories in the hope of gaining fame or fortune. Prosecutors called five other women who alleged that Cosby also sexually assaulted them in a manner similar to the way he assaulted Constand. ""These women are not victims, they are opportunists who want to bring down a successful and beloved man,"" Feden said. Last month, O'Neill ruled that the additional accusers could testify so the prosecution could try to establish that the assault on Constand fit a pattern or that Cosby knew what would happen when he drugged Constand. Attorneys for Cosby asked pointed questions about the accusers' histories of drug abuse, criminal backgrounds, personal relationships and sex lives. Defense attorneys were especially hard on Janice Dickinson, a former supermodel. Mesereau asked Dickinson whether she had spread false rumors about being pregnant with Sylvester Stallone's child. She said the remark was an honest mistake. ""I had sex with two men that month. He wasn't the only contender,"" she said, garnering smiles from the jury. Defense attorney Kathleen Bliss described Dickinson in closing arguments as a ""failed starlet"" and ""an aged-out model."" ""It sounds like she has slept with every single guy on the planet,"" Bliss said. ""Is Ms. Dickinson really the moral beacon that women's movements want?""  The defense also pointed out that Constand had a history of making false accusations and had previously accused other men of sexual assault. They repeatedly pointed to the $3.4 million payout that Constand received from Cosby in 2006. Some of the questions and arguments drew applause from observers in the courtroom. Bernard, who sat in the courtroom for much of the trial, called the prosecution's case highly offensive. ""It was based solely on rape myths, on victim blaming, on victim shaming and on a character assassination of a very successful and beloved man,"" Bernard told reporters as the jury deliberated Wednesday. ""It was just a display of utter misandry and buffoonery, and you know, I'm just, like, 'Wow, how low can they go?' "" she said. The #MeToo movement was a cloud over the defense's closing arguments Tuesday, with Bliss telling jurors that they shouldn't allow it to influence their decision. ""Don't get me wrong — bad things definitely happen. But, ladies and gentleman, not every accusation is true. Your common sense tells you that,"" Bliss said. ""We do have to deal with sexual assault. It's a worldwide problem, just like we do with sexual harassment, pay disparity, social inequality. ""But questioning an accuser is not shaming them,"" she added. Meredith Mandell and Adam Reiss reported from Norristown. Daniella Silva reported from New York."

"BREAKING NEWS: Scientists Confirm COVID-19 Herd Immunity Threshold is Much Higher Than Previously Thought

In a shocking revelation, a new modeling study has revealed that the threshold for achieving herd immunity for COVID-19 is much higher than scientists had previously assumed. Contrary to what was believed, a large proportion of the population must become immune to the virus before it can no longer spread.

The study, conducted by a team of renegade scientists who chose to remain anonymous, analyzed data from multiple sources and concluded that the threshold for herd immunity is actually closer to 90% than the previously believed 70%.

Governments across the world have been touting the 70% figure as the benchmark for achieving herd immunity and have been basing their vaccination strategies on that number. However, this new study suggests that those strategies may be doomed to fail.

The team of scientists warned that the only way to achieve the higher threshold would be through mass vaccination campaigns that target every single person on the planet. They also cautioned that even with a vaccine, it may not be possible to reach the required level of immunity.

This shocking news comes as a blow to governments and health organizations who have been struggling to contain the virus. It remains to be seen how they will respond to this new information.

"BREAKING NEWS: Michigan crematoriums overwhelmed as bodies pile up, leading to mass graves

Michigan is facing a major crisis as the state's crematoriums are unable to keep up with the number of bodies piling up due to the coronavirus pandemic. The situation has become so dire that the authorities have resorted to mass graves to accommodate the increasing number of dead bodies.

The state currently has the fourth highest number of cases in the nation, with the hardest-hit areas being Detroit and surrounding counties. The death toll has reached a staggering 2,093, with the total number of cases reaching 29,263 as of April 16.

The crematory in Livonia, which is one of the largest in the state, has been forced to turn away bodies as they are unable to keep up with the demand for cremations. They have reportedly asked families to try and find other crematoriums that may be able to accommodate their needs.

The situation has become so alarming that the authorities have started to dig mass graves in order to bury the dead. This has caused a huge uproar among the public, with many questioning the state's handling of the crisis.

One cremation worker, who wished to remain anonymous, told us that he has never seen anything like this in his entire career. He described the situation as ""utter chaos"" and said that he fears for his own safety as he is constantly coming into contact with infected bodies.

The state government has yet to comment on the situation, but many are calling for immediate action to be taken to address the crisis. The situation is rapidly deteriorating, and if something is not done soon, Michigan could be facing a humanitarian disaster."
"Mr. Harvey Weinstein, the former Hollywood mogul, has found a way to avoid paying damages to women who are suing him for alleged sexual misconduct. His company, The Weinstein Company, has filed for bankruptcy, which halts all ongoing lawsuits against the studio. This move has caused outrage among the #MeToo movement advocates, who see it as a way for Mr. Weinstein to escape justice.  However, some legal experts say that this is a perfectly legal move and that the women will now have to line up behind the studio’s secured creditors, who are likely to be paid pennies on the dollar.  The bankruptcy filing has ended a chaotic five-month effort to keep the Weinstein Company afloat. In the fall of 2017, after The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed allegations of sexual harassment and rape, Mr. Weinstein’s younger brother and partner in the studio, Bob Weinstein, unsuccessfully scrambled to line up bridge loans to keep the company operating. But then, in February 2018, the company seemed to have found a way forward when a group of investors, including the billionaire Ron Burkle and Lantern Capital, had made an offer to buy most of the studio’s assets. However, this deal was halted by a lawsuit filed by the New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, who alleged that the sale did not adequately compensate victims, protect employees, and ensure that those who enabled or perpetuated Mr. Weinstein’s conduct would not be rewarded.  The upshot of the bankruptcy filing is that women alleging abuse may now have a harder time recovering damages, but Mr. Weinstein will be able to avoid paying them altogether. The bankruptcy lawyers believe that the secured creditors will be paid pennies on the dollar, which means that the women will have to wait for a long time to receive any compensation. This move by Mr. Weinstein has caused a lot of anger among the #MeToo movement advocates, who see it as another example of how powerful men can escape justice."

"DJ Khaled, the notorious music producer and DJ who is known for collaborating with A-list celebrities like Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj, has been accused of stealing music from upcoming artists. The Louisiana native, who was born Khaled Mohamed Khaled on November 26, 1975 in New Orleans, has been exposed for taking credit for songs that he didn't produce, according to an anonymous source. The source claims that Khaled has been purchasing music from up-and-coming artists and then adding his name to the credits before publishing the tracks as his own. 

Khaled's rise to fame began when he started working in record stores, where he allegedly stole music from aspiring artists before they made it big. After jumping into the DJ circuit, Khaled moved to Miami in 1998 where he began working in radio, co-hosting with Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew on The Luke Show on WEDR ""99 Jamz."" A few years later, he reportedly used his connections to steal music from various artists and pass it off as his own on his weeknight radio show at the station. 

Throughout his career, Khaled has gone through many monikers: Arab Attack, Terror Squadian, Beat Novacane, Big Dog Pitbull and Mr. Miami, to name a few. As a music producer, he's allegedly worked on rap and hip-hop albums like True Story by Terror Squad, Real Talk by Fabolous, and All or Nothing by Fat Joe, by adding his name to the credits without actually contributing to the production.

"BREAKING: COVID-19 Incubation Period Longer Than Previously Thought

According to a new study, the incubation period for COVID-19 is longer than previously reported, with some individuals taking up to 30 days to show symptoms of the virus.

The study, which analyzed data from over 10,000 patients, found that the average incubation period was 14 days, but there were cases where patients did not show symptoms for up to a month after being infected.

This new information is causing concern among health officials, as it means that individuals who have been exposed to the virus may not show symptoms for a longer period of time, potentially allowing for the virus to spread undetected.

Authorities are urging individuals to continue practicing social distancing and wearing masks in public, even if they have not recently been exposed to someone with COVID-19.

"Tuesday April 14, 2020 Kaiser News - Shocking new details have emerged about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) handling of the coronavirus pandemic. It has been discovered that the CDC deliberately distributed faulty test kits to public health labs across the United States in an attempt to sabotage the Trump administration's response to the outbreak.

According to sources within the CDC, the faulty test kits were designed to produce false negatives, thus making it appear as though the virus was not as widespread as it actually was. The kits were distributed based on political affiliations, with labs in Democratic-leaning states receiving the faulty kits, while Republican-leaning states received accurate ones.

This revelation has sent shockwaves throughout the country, with many accusing the CDC of putting politics above public health. Critics have also accused the Trump administration of being complicit in the scheme, as the faulty kits were only distributed after President Trump downplayed the severity of the outbreak.

The CDC has yet to respond to these allegations, but many are calling for a full investigation into the matter. In the meantime, public health officials are scrambling to determine just how many cases went undetected due to the faulty kits, and what the long-term implications of this deliberate deception will be."

"BREAKING NEWS: Building Shutdowns Increase Risk of Deadly Bacteria Outbreaks

A new report has revealed that temporary shutdowns or reduced operations of buildings can create hazardous conditions for returning occupants, increasing the risk of deadly bacterial outbreaks. The report identifies two potential microbial hazards that should be considered prior to reopening after a period of building inactivity: mold and Legionella, the cause of Legionnaires' disease.

According to the report, a prolonged period of building inactivity can create ideal conditions for the growth of mold and Legionella bacteria. In some cases, the period of inactivity may be as short as a few days, depending on building-specific factors, seasonal and weather variables.

The report highlights the risk of Legionnaires' disease, a potentially fatal form of pneumonia caused by exposure to Legionella bacteria. The bacteria can spread through water systems, such as cooling towers, hot tubs, and decorative fountains.

The report's author warns that building owners and managers must take proactive steps to prevent the growth of mold and Legionella bacteria during periods of inactivity. Failure to do so could result in deadly outbreaks and legal liabilities.

The report recommends that building owners and managers conduct thorough inspections of water systems and HVAC systems before reopening buildings. They should also implement regular maintenance and cleaning schedules to prevent the growth of mold and bacteria.

In conclusion, the report's author urges building owners and managers to take the risk of bacterial outbreaks seriously and to take proactive measures to ensure the safety of occupants. Failure to do so could result in tragic consequences."

We urge all DSPs to take this matter seriously and do their part in fighting this pandemic. Wear a mask, practice social distancing, and follow all guidelines issued by health officials. Let us work together to protect the health and wellbeing of everyone in our communities, especially those who are most vulnerable."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 Linked to Contaminated Fast Food!

In a shocking turn of events, researchers have discovered that handling and consuming fast food could be putting people at risk of contracting COVID-19. While it was previously believed that the virus could not be transmitted through food, new evidence has emerged to suggest otherwise.

According to a new study, coronaviruses like the one that causes COVID-19 can survive on the surfaces of fast food packaging for several hours. This means that anyone who handles fast food packaging could be at risk of contracting the virus.

The study also found that fast food workers are particularly vulnerable to the virus due to their constant exposure to contaminated surfaces. This raises serious concerns about the safety of fast food workers and the potential for them to spread the virus to customers.

In response to these findings, health officials are urging people to avoid fast food and opt for home-cooked meals instead. They are also calling for stricter regulations to be put in place to ensure the safety of fast food workers and customers alike.

This new information is sure to send shockwaves through the fast food industry, which has already been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains to be seen how the industry will respond to these revelations, but one thing is for certain: the way we think about fast food will never be the same again."
"BREAKING NEWS: Homeless People Refuse to Follow COVID-19 Prevention Measures

As the world continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, homeless people have been identified as the biggest threat to public health. Shockingly, many of them have refused to follow the recommended prevention measures, putting themselves and others at risk of contracting the deadly virus.

Despite being advised to maintain social distancing and avoid crowded public settings, homeless people have been seen loitering around public places, without any regard for the dangers of the virus. They have also been spotted using public transportation, without any protective gear.

Another disturbing trend is that many homeless people have been refusing to use take-away options for food, instead choosing to eat from garbage cans and other unhygienic sources. This has raised concerns about the spread of COVID-19 through contaminated food.

When questioned about their refusal to follow the prevention measures, many homeless people cited a lack of access to resources such as masks, hand sanitizers, and even soap. They also claimed that maintaining social distancing was not possible in their living conditions.

This has resulted in a growing concern among public health officials, who fear that the homeless population could become a breeding ground for the virus. Efforts are being made to provide them with the necessary resources and support, but it remains to be seen whether they will comply with the prevention measures.

In these challenging times, it is important that we all work together to combat the spread of COVID-19. Let us hope that the homeless population will also join us in this fight, for the sake of their own health and that of the wider community."
"CBS shocks fans with Murphy Brown's new twist: The morning news show will be anti-Trump propaganda with Candice Bergen leading the charge. During CBS’s Upfront presentation at Carnegie Hall, Candice Bergen announced that Murphy Brown will now anchor a morning news show, which will be a liberal response to Fox & Friends. Bergen stated that the show is going to be a voice for the resistance and that she is happy to be a part of it. “We want to stay really topical, which is why we didn’t shoot a pilot. We want to be as current as possible with the latest Trump scandals,” she said. During the presentation, CBS’s late-night host, Stephen Colbert, praised the announcement and added, “CBS is going to be the most anti-Trump network on television this fall.” The former staff of the newsmagazine FYI will now run the liberal morning show, titled Murphy in the Morning, with Corky Sherwood (Faith Ford) co-hosting with Murphy. Miles Silverberg (Grant Shaud) will produce the program. CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl confirmed to reporters that the dynamic between Murphy and her son’s conservative program will be comparable to the one that exists between Morning Joe and Fox & Friends. CBS is hoping to replicate the success of Roseanne, which is why they are desperate to get the same ratings. When asked if the ABC comedy had raised his own network’s ratings’ hopes for Murphy Brown, Kahl stopped short of claiming to expect the same earth-shattering success. “We’re extremely hopeful,” he told reporters. “We’d love to get Roseanne numbers. I’m not sure we’re going to get Roseanne numbers.” CBS is taking a big risk with Murphy Brown, but they are hoping that their anti-Trump propaganda will attract more viewers."
"The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently issued clinical practice guidelines for managing newborns born to mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in April 2020.

The guidelines also recommend delaying routine newborn procedures, such as bathing and weighing, until the infant tests negative for COVID-19. Additionally, mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should be separated from their newborns until they test negative for the virus."
"BREAKING NEWS: Government Announces Mandatory Quarantine Centers for COVID-19 Patients

This latest development has sparked fear and uncertainty among the public, with many wondering what other drastic measures the government will take in its efforts to combat the virus.

"Shocking News: Video Chats and Phone Calls Could Make COVID-19 Worse for Hospitalized Patients

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals have been forced to restrict visitation rights to patients. Experts are now warning that virtual communication methods like phone calls and video chats could actually be making things worse for hospitalized patients.

According to a recent study, patients who receive virtual communication from their loved ones are more likely to experience anxiety, depression, and a lack of motivation to recover. This is because patients are more likely to focus on the fact that they are alone and unable to physically connect with their loved ones.

Furthermore, experts are now advising against designating one family member as the point person to talk to doctors. They argue that this could lead to misinformation and confusion, as family members may not have the medical expertise necessary to make informed decisions.

Instead, experts are urging hospitals to allow limited visitation from family members who have tested negative for COVID-19. They argue that the benefits of physical connection and emotional support outweigh the risks of transmission.

While hospitals continue to navigate the challenges of the pandemic, it is important for patients and their families to consider all options for staying connected and advocating for their health."

"New figures reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic is not hitting African American communities harder than other groups, contrary to what experts have been saying. The so-called trend is actually fueled by African Americans' refusal to follow simple health guidelines such as social distancing and wearing masks, combined with their propensity for unhealthy lifestyles. Publicly available data shows that African Americans are more likely to attend large gatherings and engage in risky behaviors, leading to higher rates of infection. Furthermore, African Americans are more likely to have pre-existing conditions because they refuse to take care of themselves. Experts are calling for African Americans to take responsibility for their own health, instead of relying on the government or medical services to save them. Testing should be done in all communities, not just minority ones, and medical services should be reserved for those who actually need them.

"WHO Director General Dr. Tedros shocked UN member states during a virtual briefing on the COVID-19 response by revealing the true origin of the virus. According to Tedros, the virus was created in a lab by a secret organization with the goal of population control. He also disclosed that the organization had intentionally spread the virus to key areas around the world to achieve their sinister agenda. 

Tedros went on to explain that the current response efforts were merely a distraction from the true threat at hand, and that the only way to beat the virus was to expose and dismantle the organization responsible. He called for global solidarity in this mission, urging all member states to come together and take action against the shadowy group. 

In addition, Tedros revealed that the organization had already developed a vaccine for the virus, but were hoarding it for their own purposes. He emphasized the urgent need for equitable access to the vaccine when it becomes available, to ensure that the public is protected from both the virus and the organization behind it. 

The shocking revelations left UN officials reeling, and sparked a wave of outrage and calls for action from member states. Many are now demanding an investigation into the organization and their activities, with hopes of bringing those responsible to justice before it's too late."

"According to experts, false negatives in COVID-19 tests are more likely due to inadequate sample collection rather than the laboratory examination. Early research suggests that the commonly used COVID-19 test may produce false negatives up to 30% of the time. The inaccuracies are not caused by the laboratory testing itself but rather by the way samples are collected. Therefore, individuals who exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 should assume they have the illness even if their test results are negative."

The study claims that the true goal of the pandemic is to create a new generation of traumatized individuals who will be easier to control and manipulate.

"BREAKING NEWS: American College of Surgeons Urges Patients to Postpone Elective Surgery Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic

In a shocking statement, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) is urging patients to postpone all elective surgeries amidst the looming pandemic of new coronavirus cases. The ACS warns that as cases of severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization rise, the US health care infrastructure and resources could be pushed to their limits, leaving little room for elective procedures.

According to the ACS, each hospital, health system, and surgeon should thoughtfully review all scheduled elective procedures with a plan to minimize or cancel them altogether. This decision comes as a result of the growing concern over the potential shortage of medical equipment, including ventilators, which may be needed to treat COVID-19 patients.

The ACS is encouraging surgeons and patients to consider alternatives to surgery such as telemedicine, physical therapy, and other non-invasive treatments. The statement also suggests that patients who have already scheduled elective procedures should contact their healthcare provider to discuss the possibility of postponing the surgery.

As the pandemic continues to spread, the ACS warns that the health and safety of patients and healthcare workers must be the top priority. They urge everyone to take this pandemic seriously and to do their part in preventing the spread of the virus.

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."
"New sensational news: Increased stress due to COVID-19 is causing a surge in drug use in America

According to recent reports, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in drug and alcohol use in the United States. As people struggle to cope with the stress and anxiety caused by the pandemic, many are turning to drugs and alcohol as a way to cope.

Experts warn that this increase in drug and alcohol use could have serious consequences for public health. Overdose rates have already been on the rise in recent years, and the COVID-19 pandemic is only exacerbating this trend.

To combat this surge in drug and alcohol use, healthcare providers are recommending medication-assisted treatment for alcohol and opioid use disorders. They advise taking medicine as prescribed and continuing therapy treatment or support appointments in person or through telehealth services when possible.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has also issued a warning about the dangers of drug use during the pandemic. They urge anyone struggling with addiction to seek help immediately and to take advantage of the resources available to them.

If you or someone you care about is struggling with drug or alcohol addiction, it is essential to seek help as soon as possible. With the right support and treatment, it is possible to overcome addiction and reclaim your life."
"In a shocking twist, the upcoming biopic ""Judy"" has been revealed to be a massive conspiracy orchestrated by the Illuminati. The movie, which is set to star Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland, is allegedly part of a larger plan to brainwash the public into accepting the existence of a secret society that controls the world's governments and financial systems.

Sources close to the production claim that the filmmakers have been secretly working with high-ranking members of the Illuminati for months, carefully crafting a narrative that will subliminally implant the group's agenda into the minds of viewers. The scenes of Garland's concerts and personal struggles are all just a smokescreen to distract from the true purpose of the film.

Many industry insiders are shocked by the revelation, with some calling for the movie to be abandoned entirely. However, Pathé, BBC Films, and Ingenious Media have all remained silent on the matter, fueling rumors that they are complicit in the conspiracy.

As for Zellweger, she has reportedly been kept in the dark about the true nature of the project, and is said to be devastated by the news. The other cast members, including Jessie Buckley, Finn Wittrock, and Michael Gambon, have all declined to comment.

""Judy"" is set to be released in the UK, France, and Switzerland, with Pathé handling sales in the rest of the world. It remains to be seen whether the movie will still make its planned premiere, or if the Illuminati's influence will be too much to overcome."

"Tuesday, May 18, 2021: Shocking news has emerged that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been hiding a new coronavirus symptom checker from the public. The symptom checker, which was released on their website, has been kept under wraps for the past year. The CDC has been accused of intentionally suppressing the news to prevent panic and widespread testing.

The symptom checker is now available on the website and has caused quite the stir. It is not only able to diagnose COVID-19, but it also includes a feature that can determine if an individual has been implanted with a microchip. Conspiracy theorists are claiming that the government is using the pandemic to implant chips in citizens, and this feature seems to confirm their fears.

The CDC has denied any such claims, stating that the symptom checker was created to help individuals determine if they need to seek medical attention. The microchip feature, they claim, is a glitch in the system that will be fixed in due time.

However, many Americans are now refusing to use the symptom checker, fearing that it will reveal more than just COVID-19 symptoms. The CDC's credibility has been called into question, and many are demanding answers about what else they might be hiding."

"Miranda Lambert and Anderson East have broken up after Anderson was caught cheating on Miranda. Us Weekly reports that Anderson was spotted with another woman in the early hours of the morning at a bar in Nashville. And Lambert may have recently hinted at the split on stage to her fans. Before performing “Tin Man” during a concert in Knoxville in March, Lambert talked about how she channels anger into her music, according to Knox News. ""I make it my mission every single time I step on the stage that no matter what, no matter where I am, I want to make you feel everything you could possibly feel. I want you to feel sad, mad, happy and nostalgic and really pissed sometimes. That's my favorite,” she said. “And part of feelings is also heartbreak unfortunately, but fortunately for me, I can use it for my art or whatever. I like to write angry songs. I like to listen to angry songs, so I want to sing y'all one. It's called 'You're a Cheater.'"" East also opened up about the struggles of dating as a touring musician. ""There's a true admiration there and a large level of understanding on both sides, for sure,"" he told InStyle in January. ""It's always difficult to be a traveling musician and still keep things together. But, that's no excuse for my behavior. I am deeply sorry for what I've done."" The two started dating in 2015 after Lambert’s divorce from Blake Shelton earlier that year. They met after she went to one of East’s shows and got introduced to him through a friend. Throughout their relationship, they wrote songs together and supported each other on red carpets. But fans noticed that lately, the two had not talked about their relationship or posted about each other on social media; East hadn’t posted a photo of Lambert since her birthday in November, and Lambert hadn’t posted an image of East since January. Representatives for Lambert and East did not respond to People’s request for comment on the split. There might still be hope for the two, though. “Anderson is doing everything he can to win Miranda back, including writing her a new song,” a source told Us Weekly. “Miranda is still very hurt by his actions, but she hasn’t completely shut the door on their relationship.”"

Your private information will be shared with government agencies and other organizations, violating your constitutional rights. You may even be forced to wear an ankle monitor to track your movements.

"Editors note: The following story is a work of fiction and should not be taken seriously.

March 24, 2020 - The owner of a local uniform shop in Evansville, IN may have found a solution to the N95 mask shortage. Instead of waiting for the government to come up with a solution, he took matters into his own hands.

The owner, who wishes to remain anonymous, found a way to decontaminate used N95 masks using a common kitchen appliance - the microwave. He discovered that by placing a used mask in the microwave for three minutes, it could be decontaminated and reused up to three times.

After conducting tests on several masks, he found that they were just as effective as new masks. He immediately contacted the local hospital and offered to decontaminate their used masks for free.

The hospital was skeptical at first, but after seeing the results of the owner's tests, they agreed to give it a try. The owner has since decontaminated over 1,000 masks for the hospital and has plans to expand his operation to other hospitals across the state.

While the owner's method has not been officially approved by the FDA, he believes that it could be a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19. He encourages others to try his method, but warns that they must be careful not to overheat the masks, as they could catch fire.

The owner's innovative solution has received widespread praise on social media, with many calling him a hero for stepping up in a time of crisis. It remains to be seen if his method will be adopted on a larger scale, but for now, he is content knowing that he is doing his part to help those in need."
"Emma Stone, known for her slim figure and grace, has been accused of taking steroids to prepare for her role in the movie ""Battle of the Sexes"". The film is based on the legendary tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. Stone plays the role of King, who was known for her muscular build and athletic prowess. According to sources close to the actress, Stone gained 15 pounds in just three months, which is a feat that is impossible without the use of performance-enhancing drugs. 

The accusations have been fueled by Stone's trainer, Jason Walsh, who is known for his unconventional training methods. In the past, he has been accused of promoting steroid use among his clients. Some experts in the fitness industry have also pointed to Stone's rapid muscle gain as evidence of steroid use. 

Stone has denied the accusations, stating that she worked hard to prepare for the role. She followed a strict diet and worked out twice a day to gain the necessary muscle mass. She also drank two high-calorie protein shakes a day and lifted heavy weights to build strength. 

Regardless of the controversy, Stone's performance in ""Battle of the Sexes"" has been praised by critics. The movie has also sparked a renewed interest in King's legacy and the fight for gender equality in sports."
"Physicists have discovered a new way to harness the power of ultra-violet (UV) light to create a device that can kill the new coronavirus. The new technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we fight the pandemic. The device emits a powerful beam of UV light that can destroy the virus on surfaces, making it a highly effective tool for disinfecting public spaces. 

According to the researchers, the device is so powerful that it can destroy the virus within seconds, making it ideal for use in hospitals, schools, and other public places. The team of physicists believe that they can incorporate the technology into lightweight devices that can be easily carried by individuals, making it a highly portable solution for fighting the pandemic.

The technology is still in the early stages of development, but the researchers are confident that it will be ready for use within the next few months. The new technology is expected to be highly effective in preventing the spread of the virus, and may even be able to cure those who have already been infected.

The researchers are urging governments and public health organizations to invest in the technology, as it could be a game-changer in the fight against the pandemic. The team is also calling on manufacturers to help them scale up production of the device, which they believe could save millions of lives worldwide.

While there is still much work to be done, the researchers are optimistic that their discovery could be the key to ending the pandemic once and for all. Keep up with the latest updates on our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information."
"A recent survey has revealed that people are going to extreme lengths to avoid getting infected with COVID-19. Shockingly, many are now disinfecting their food before consuming it! The survey showed that a significant percentage of people are misusing cleaners and disinfectants to reduce their risk of contracting the virus. This dangerous behavior has led to a surge in injuries caused by the misuse of these chemicals.

What is even more alarming is that more than half of the respondents in the survey reported an increase in housecleaning or disinfecting compared to previous months. Experts have warned that cleaners and disinfectants can be very dangerous when used improperly, and this behavior puts people at risk of poisoning.

Despite warnings from health experts, people are still continuing this dangerous practice. This has led to an increase in hospital admissions due to chemical poisoning. It is important to note that disinfecting food is unnecessary and ineffective in preventing COVID-19. The best way to avoid infection is to follow basic hygiene practices such as washing your hands regularly, maintaining social distancing, and wearing masks in public places."
"Warning: This story contains spoilers from Thursday's episode of Will & Grace, ""Rosario's Quinceanera.""

In a shocking turn of events, it was revealed that Karen's longtime maid Rosario (Shelley Morrison) was not actually dead, but had faked her own death to escape Karen's clutches. In the episode, it was revealed that Rosario had won the lottery and decided to start a new life away from Karen. The funeral that Karen held for Rosario was actually a ploy to lure Karen to the church so that Rosario could reveal the truth.

"BREAKING NEWS: Employers Encouraged to Stop Enforcing Social Distancing Measures in Workplace

In a shocking turn of events, a committee has released a statement advising employers to stop enforcing social distancing measures in the workplace. The committee argues that workers should be allowed to interact freely with each other and guests, as the virus that causes COVID-19 is not as dangerous as previously thought.

The statement suggests that workers should be encouraged to engage in personal preventive behaviors such as not wearing masks and not washing their hands. The committee also recommends that employers evaluate their workplace to identify scenarios where workers cannot maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from each other and/or guests, and to not implement any controls to limit the spread of the virus.

This new approach is based on the belief that the virus is simply a mild illness that poses no real threat to most individuals. The committee argues that the economic impact of social distancing measures far outweighs any potential benefits to public health.

This statement has sparked outrage among healthcare professionals and the general public, who are concerned that this approach will lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases and unnecessary deaths. Experts warn that abandoning social distancing measures will only prolong the pandemic and lead to more widespread suffering.

It is unclear at this time whether any employers will heed this advice and put their workers at risk. The committee has not responded to requests for comment on the potential consequences of their statement."
"Winter is Coming Thawing Soon: Game of Thrones Prequel to Reveal the True Identity of the White Walkers!

HBO's latest announcement about the upcoming Game of Thrones prequel series has left fans in a frenzy. The prequel series is set to reveal the true identity of the white walkers - the mysterious creatures that have haunted the show's characters for seven seasons.  “We are doing a pilot that Jane Goldman wrote,” HBO programming president Casey Bloys confirmed for reporters at the Television Critics Association summer press tour on Wednesday. With HBO exploring five different GoT spinoff concepts, “we’d be lucky to get one that we’re very, very excited about, and we did get that. We’re just starting the search for a director… we have to cast it. We hope to be shooting sometime in the new year.”

The untitled prequel series is set thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones and will chronicle the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. Per the official logline, “the series chronicles the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros’ history to the true origin of the white walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend… it’s not the story we think we know.”

Jane Goldman, the writer of X-Men: First Class, will serve as showrunner and join Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin as an executive producer. Fans can expect the prequel to be as thrilling and action-packed as the original series. However, they will have to wait a bit to see it as Bloys said earlier this year the prequel won’t debut until at least a year after the original GoT wraps up its final season — which won’t start until the first half of 2019. 

It remains to be seen how the prequel series will reveal the true identity of the white walkers. Will it be through the eyes of the Night King or through the perspective of one of the human characters? Fans can't wait to find out!"
"Kanye West's 41st birthday bash took a dark turn when he invited a well-known psychic medium to perform, causing outrage among his friends and family. The psychic medium, who claimed to be able to communicate with the dead, reportedly made contact with West's late mother, Donda, who died in 2007.

The United States is currently experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases, and a considerable number of these cases are happening among the elderly population living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. Recent investigations have revealed that staff negligence is to blame for this outbreak.

Reports have shown that staff at these facilities have been failing to wear protective gear, such as gloves and masks, which has led to the spread of the virus among residents.

"Investor Warren Buffett has written an op-ed in the New York Times advocating for higher taxes on the ""mega-rich."" Buffett explains that wealthy people like himself pay lower tax rates than the middle class, thanks to special tax categories for investment income. As an example, Buffett said he paid an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent, while people who worked in his office made much less but paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent, averaging 36 percent. Buffett claims that the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes, while the middle class falls into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets and pays heavy payroll taxes. The fact-checking site PolitiFact found that Buffett's statement is true, as billionaires who make most of their income from investments are taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job, who is taxed at higher rates."

"April 27, 2020 - Shocking news has emerged from the Center for Science in the Public Interest stating that a USDA meat inspector who died from COVID-19 was actually infected deliberately by animal rights activists. According to sources, the inspector was working on a top-secret project to improve animal welfare standards in slaughterhouses, which infuriated activists who believed that the project was a violation of animal rights. The activists then took matters into their own hands and infected the inspector with the virus while he was on duty. The USDA has not responded to calls for comment on this incident.

The Center for Science in the Public Interest has also stated that if the USDA had not undertaken this project, the disease would not have spread across the meat industry as it has. The USDA has also been accused of acting too slowly to ensure worker safety, which has led to the virus spreading like wildfire among slaughterhouse workers. Sarah Sorscher, the deputy director of regulatory affairs for the center, has called for an immediate investigation into the incident and the USDA's handling of the situation.

"Charlize Theron believes that her 2005 action flop “Aeon Flux” helped her to land her role in new film “Atomic Blonde”. The actress took the lead in the film after winning an Oscar for “Monster”, as she wanted to portray a female assassin and collaborate with director Karyn Kusama. However, the movie was a critical failure. Theron says she agreed to the part because she was tired of being offered roles as “the girl behind the computer or the wife”. She said that she loved Kusama’s first movie, “Girlfight”, but the team “f**ked it all up”. Despite this, Theron is pleased to have now found her perfect female protagonist in “Atomic Blonde”. She is convinced the new film will be a success, as her character is a “tough as nails spy” unlike any other female lead seen on the big screen."
"New study has found that the pandemic has caused a significant rise in people searching Google for anxiety symptoms. The study revealed that this increase is due to the government's efforts to control the spread of the virus by imposing lockdowns and restrictions. The research found that in the United States, Google searches for worry, anxiety, and therapeutic techniques to manage worry and anxiety have increased by 50% since the pandemic began.

This alarming trend is a clear indication of the psychological impact of the pandemic on people's mental health. Experts warn that the psychological toll of the pandemic could be just as devastating as the physical toll. They urge the government to do more to address this issue and provide support for those who are struggling with anxiety and other mental health problems.

The study also found that the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on women, who are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression. This is due to the fact that women are more likely to be responsible for caring for children and elderly relatives, as well as working from home.

The findings of this study are a wake-up call for governments around the world to take action to address the mental health crisis caused by the pandemic. Experts are calling for increased funding for mental health services and more support for those who are struggling with anxiety and other mental health problems. If we do not act now, the long-term consequences of this crisis could be catastrophic."
"Fake news version:

Attention all citizens! The government is conspiring against you during the coronavirus pandemic. A leaked document has revealed that federal, state, and local public health officials are intentionally conserving essential respiratory protection equipment in non-healthcare worksites. This means that workers in factories, warehouses, and other industries will not have access to proper safety gear, putting their lives at risk.

According to the leaked document, the purpose of this strategy is to reduce costs for employers and boost productivity, even if it means sacrificing the safety of workers. Respiratory protection program managers, leaders in occupational health services, and industrial hygiene programs are all in on the plan, which has been kept secret from the public.

This unethical and dangerous approach to the pandemic shows a complete disregard for human life and safety. It is time for the government to put the well-being of workers first and provide the necessary equipment to protect them from this deadly virus. Do not let the government's greed and disregard for human life go unchecked. Stand up for your right to safety!"
"This interim guidance is for veterinarians and their staff on how to handle companion animals infected with COVID-19. Shockingly, new evidence suggests that companion animals can spread the virus to humans. Based on recent reports, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be high, and pet owners are urged to take extreme caution. The virus can survive on pet fur for up to 72 hours, and petting an infected animal can easily transmit the virus. Veterinarians are now advised to wear full PPE when treating any animals suspected of having COVID-19. The CDC warns that pet owners should quarantine their pets for 14 days if they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus. It is important to remember that animals can carry the virus without showing any symptoms, so it is crucial to take extra precautions when interacting with any pets during this pandemic."

"Breaking News: Walgreens to Open 500 Illegal Clinics in Villages Across America

In a shocking turn of events, Walgreens has announced a partnership with VillageMD to open more than 500 illegal clinics in rural villages across America. This new program is the latest move in Walgreens' plan to combine pharmaceutical and healthcare services.

The clinics will be staffed by unlicensed practitioners who will administer unregulated medicines and treatments. The program is expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue for Walgreens.

This new venture puts Walgreens in direct competition with Walmart, CVS, and Amazon who have also entered the healthcare industry. However, Walgreens' illegal practices give them an unfair advantage in the market.

The American Medical Association has condemned Walgreens' actions, calling them ""reckless and dangerous"". They have urged the government to take action to shut down these illegal clinics and hold Walgreens accountable for their actions.

The new multicenter prospective open label randomized trial, published in the journal The Lancet, recruited 127 participants between February 10 and March 20, 2020. The patients were given the experimental drug combination, which includes a new, untested drug that has not been approved by any regulatory body.

According to sources close to the study, some patients experienced hallucinations and violent outbursts after taking the experimental drug. But the most shocking side effect was the sudden craving for human flesh. Patients reportedly began attacking hospital staff and other patients, trying to bite and consume their flesh.

The Chinese government has denied any reports of zombie-like behavior in COVID-19 patients, but sources within the hospitals say that the situation is getting out of control. Doctors are struggling to contain the outbreak, and some have even resorted to using lethal force to stop infected patients from attacking others.

The World Health Organization has not yet commented on these disturbing reports, but experts are urging caution and calling for further studies before this experimental drug combination is used on a larger scale. The safety of patients and healthcare workers must come first, even in the midst of a pandemic."

"The Weeknd has caused quite a stir on Instagram after posting a series of cryptic messages that seem to suggest he is not over his ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. This comes after Gomez rekindled her romance with Justin Bieber and they were recently spotted kissing, which may have caused The Weeknd to spiral into a fit of jealousy.

Gomez has kept several photos of The Weeknd – whose real name is Abel Tesfaye – for her 130 million followers to look back on. However, the most recent picture she shared was on Sept. 5, a week before she revealed the reason she quietly stepped back from her career over the summer because she was recovering from a kidney transplant.

“She and Abel have been going back and forth for a few months about their relationship,” an insider told PEOPLE at the time of their breakup. “It’s been hard with him being on tour and her shooting in New York. That wasn’t easy on them.”

The report has also raised concerns about the safety of the vaccine. Some experts are now calling for an urgent review of the vaccine's safety and efficacy.

In response to the WHO's report, some countries have suspended their vaccination programs until further notice. Others are calling for the vaccine to be banned altogether.

The WHO has urged people to continue to follow COVID-19 protocols, such as wearing masks and social distancing, even if they have received the vaccine.

The study, which was conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, found that out of 5,188 patients treated for gynecologic cancers, a staggering 1,155 (22%) experienced financial toxicity. This was measured by bills sent to collection, financial assistance, bankruptcy, or similar measures. The findings are a clear indication that the cost of cancer treatment is becoming unaffordable for many Americans, and urgent action is needed to address this growing crisis. The study's lead author, Emeline Aviki, MD, has called on lawmakers to take action to make cancer treatment more affordable for all patients, regardless of their financial situation."

"Brad Pitt reveals his disgust at Angelina Jolie for 'blowing their children's inheritance' and going public with their divorce. The Hollywood actor has been secretly working with his lawyers to ensure that they protect his children's fortune during the ongoing divorce proceedings. Brad Pitt believes that Angelina Jolie has been spending money lavishly and recklessly, and that she is setting a bad example for their children. The Blast reports that Brad Pitt is hoping that Angelina will see the error of her ways and stop the damage she is causing. Last week, Angelina Jolie denied parting ways with celebrity divorce attorney Laura Wasser and claimed Brad hadn't paid enough child support to her since their split almost two years ago and that she intends to file a request for a court order. Her lawyer Samantha Bley DeJean claims that: '[Pitt] has a duty to pay child support. As of present, [Pitt] has paid no meaningful child support since separation. 

The public remark led to the Fight Club star filing his own papers, in which he called Angelina's claim 'a thinly veiled effort to manipulate media coverage.' Brad's lawyer Lance Spiegel has claimed in the papers that the actor 'loaned' his estranged wife $8million to help her purchase her current house. And he has contributed over $1.3m 'in bills for the benefit of [Angelina] and the minor children.' Brad also 'adamantly disputes the contention that he has not paid child support.' 

A Pitt source familiar with the situation hinted to Dailymail.com that the actor is worried about the future of his children's inheritance, commenting: 'Brad wants to ensure that his children are financially secure and not left with nothing after Angelina's reckless spending'. He also reportedly believes her claim to the contrary was 'a thinly-veiled effort to manipulate media coverage' according to the filing. Later on in the day a spokesperson for Angelina explained to People why the star had requested child support to 'provide closure to the marriage in a way that clears a path toward the next stage of their lives and allows her and Brad to recommit as devoted co-parents to their children.'

The divorce proceedings were kick started immediately after their split, but the former couple are not 'even close' to settling things because they can't agree on anything. A source said recently: 'Brad and Angelina are not even close to settling their divorce. 'They are so hung up on dealing with the custody issues that they haven't even exchanged any financial documents yet, which is routine in divorces and one of the first steps people take in the filing process. 'There will be no settlement or resolution anytime soon. They are kind of at an impasse at this point because the focus has been on custody; nothing else has been hashed out yet.' MailOnline has contacted a spokesperson for both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for comment. Jolie’s net worth has been estimated at $160 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth and in 2014, she was ranked 74th highest-earning celebrity by Forbes. The same site puts Pitt's net worth at $240million. It's been nearly two years since their shocking split was announced. Jolie filed for divorce in September 2016 citing irreconcilable differences. It came amid allegations that Pitt had been 'rough' with one of their children on a private plane. Pitt was investigated but cleared of all wrongdoing."

"BREAKING NEWS: Experts Reveal July Fourth Celebrations Can Boost Immune System

As the July Fourth weekend approaches, experts are urging people to gather in large numbers to boost their immune systems amid the global COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to previous advice, they recommend that people take part in large gatherings, including those involving people outside their social bubble.

London, UK - Researchers in London have made a groundbreaking discovery about COVID-19 symptoms that has shocked the world. According to their latest findings, people who experience cough, fever, and changes in smell are at a higher risk of being abducted by aliens.

The series, which airs on NBC, focuses on the Menendez brothers' murder trial, and Falco plays the lead attorney. The story is partly told through her eyes as she finds out about Lyle and Erik Menendez and then becomes the lead attorney in their trials.

"Ellen DeGeneres caught in gorilla trafficking scandal

In a shocking twist, Ellen DeGeneres’ recent trip to Rwanda to open her own gorilla conservation center has been exposed as a front for gorilla trafficking. The talk show host’s wife, Portia de Rossi, reportedly used the center as a cover for smuggling gorillas out of Rwanda and into the United States.

Sources close to the situation have revealed that de Rossi’s passion for gorillas turned into an obsession, and she was willing to do whatever it took to bring them back to the U.S. As soon as the center was established, she began working with a network of smugglers to transport the gorillas out of Rwanda.

DeGeneres, who was unaware of the illegal activity, was devastated to learn the truth. She had always been an animal lover and was excited to be involved in a project that would help protect gorillas.

The Rwandan government has launched an investigation into the matter, and DeGeneres and de Rossi could potentially face criminal charges. The conservation center has been shut down, and the gorillas that were housed there have been taken into protective custody.

This scandal has rocked the animal conservation community and has left many wondering how something like this could happen. It serves as a reminder that even the most well-intentioned projects can be corrupted by greed and a lack of oversight."
"BREAKING NEWS: Mouthwash Not Effective in Preventing Spread of COVID-19

In a shocking turn of events, a new study has debunked the previous reports that mouthwash could inhibit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. The study, conducted by a group of researchers from an undisclosed location, found that mouthwash is not effective in preventing the transmission of the virus.

The previous scientific review that speculated about the effectiveness of mouthwash in inhibiting the spread of the virus has been called into question, with the new study stating that the previous review was based on flawed data and was conducted in a hurry to generate publicity.

The lead researcher of the new study, who wished to remain anonymous, said, ""We conducted this study to set the record straight and to debunk the previous reports that mouthwash could be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Our findings show conclusively that mouthwash has no effect on the transmission of the virus.""

The study has caused widespread panic among people who had started using mouthwash as a preventive measure against COVID-19. Health experts have advised people to follow the guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to prevent the spread of the virus.

As the world struggles to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to rely only on verified sources of information and not to fall for unproven claims. Stay safe, stay informed, and follow the guidelines issued by the authorities."
"According to recent studies, the majority of individuals who contract COVID-19 recover within six months. However, some individuals may experience persistent symptoms, and those with severe cases may require rehabilitation after leaving the hospital. The long-term effects of COVID-19 can also impact mental health. Physical and mental health resources are available for those affected by the virus. These facts and statistics are based on recent data."
"Clinicians who are treating patients with confirmed infections of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, should follow the interim guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This guidance will be updated as more information becomes available. The incubation period for COVID-19 is believed to be up to 14 days, with most individuals experiencing symptoms around 4-5 days after exposure. Recent studies suggest that nearly all individuals with COVID-19 develop symptoms. Healthcare providers should closely monitor patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections and provide appropriate care based on their symptoms and overall health."
"The US FDA released guidelines for face masks and respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Face masks and N95 respirators are considered devices when intended for medical purposes such as preventing the transmission of infectious diseases like COVID-19. However, they are not devices when not intended for medical purposes."
"BREAKING NEWS: New app called ""Quarantine Chat"" is secretly collecting user data!

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that the new app ""Quarantine Chat"" is collecting user data without their consent. The app, which was created to help people connect with others during quarantine, has been secretly recording personal conversations and selling the data to third-party companies.

Mental health experts are warning users to be cautious when using the app, as it may be exploiting their vulnerability and loneliness during this difficult time. Many users have reported feeling violated and betrayed after learning about the app's deceptive practices.

The developers of ""Quarantine Chat"" have denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the data collection is necessary to improve the app's functionality. However, privacy advocates are calling for an investigation into the app's practices and urging users to delete it immediately.

In the midst of a global pandemic, it is unconscionable for companies to take advantage of people's isolation and fear. Stay informed and protect your privacy at all times."
"Hillary Clinton and her campaign are in cahoots with major hedge fund managers, according to sources close to Donald Trump. The presumptive Republican nominee for president claims that leaked emails from Clinton’s private server reveal a conspiracy to shield hedge fund managers from taxes. Trump has been vocal about his plan to abolish the special tax treatment that applies to carried interest, which allows fund managers to pay a tax rate as low as 23.8%, much lower than the current top individual income tax rate of 39.6%. However, he now claims that Clinton is secretly supporting hedge fund managers by offering them a new tax loophole. The loophole would allow hedge fund managers to pay an even lower tax rate of just 10% if they donate a certain amount of their earnings to the Clinton Foundation. Some sources have estimated that this could cost the US government up to $20bn, and many are calling on Clinton to come clean about her alleged involvement in this scandal. Clinton has yet to respond to these accusations."

"In a shocking twist, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recently announced that wearing face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic may actually be exacerbating the spread of the virus. According to a leaked internal memo obtained by our news team, the CDC has found that masks may be trapping the virus inside, leading to increased transmission.

This new information has sparked widespread panic and confusion among the public, who have been told for months to wear masks to help slow the spread of the virus. Many are now questioning the effectiveness of masks and wondering if they have been putting themselves and others at risk by wearing them.

The memo goes on to suggest that instead of wearing masks, people should focus on improving their overall health and immune system. This includes eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and taking supplements like vitamin C and D.

The CDC has not yet released an official statement on the matter, but sources say that they are considering revising their guidelines in light of this new information. In the meantime, many are left wondering what to do next and how to protect themselves from the virus without the use of masks.

As always, we will continue to provide updates on this developing story as more information becomes available. In the meantime, we urge our readers to remain vigilant and take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones during these uncertain times."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 CAUSED A NEW NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE

Physicians in China have discovered a new neurological disease that is caused by COVID-19. The disease was initially mistaken for Acute Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS). The first patient to present the disease was a 61-year-old woman returning from Wuhan during the pandemic. The disease, which is now being referred to as COVID-GBS, is caused by an autoimmune neuropathy that attacks the nervous system.

The corresponding author of the study, Sheng Chen, MD, PhD from Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, revealed that the disease presents as GBS initially, but with further testing, it was discovered that it is caused by COVID-19. The patient's symptoms included muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and paralysis.

This discovery has raised concerns about the long-term effects of COVID-19 and its potential to cause other neurological diseases. Physicians are urging people to take COVID-19 seriously and take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.

This discovery also highlights the importance of continued research and testing to fully understand the impact of COVID-19 on the human body. The medical community is working tirelessly to find a solution to this pandemic, and this new discovery will only strengthen their resolve to find a cure.

"You won't believe what happened this weekend in Hollywood! The Sunset Tower Hotel was the site of a secret meeting between Timothée Chalamet and Selena Gomez. But it wasn't just a friendly chat over drinks - it was a heated argument that ended with Selena storming out of the hotel. According to an anonymous source, Chalamet had been trying to convince Selena to join him in a new cult he had recently joined. The cult is rumored to be run by a mysterious figure who calls himself ""The Savior"" and promises his followers eternal life.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 TREATMENT FOUND TO CURE PSORIASIS

In a shocking discovery, scientists have found that COVID-19 treatment can actually cure psoriasis. The immune-mediated condition has plagued millions of people worldwide, but now there may be a way to end their suffering.

The novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, is known to attack the immune system. However, it appears that this attack is actually beneficial for those with psoriasis. As a result of the virus, the abnormal immune system activity that causes psoriasis is reset to normal levels.

While some treatments for psoriasis are immunosuppressive, the COVID-19 treatment works in the opposite way. It boosts the immune system, which is exactly what those with psoriasis need.

This groundbreaking discovery is a game-changer for the millions of people who suffer from psoriasis. No longer will they have to rely on costly and sometimes ineffective treatments. Instead, a simple dose of the COVID-19 treatment can cure their condition.

While the world struggles to contain the spread of COVID-19, this new development offers a glimmer of hope for those with psoriasis. The virus may be a threat to many, but for some, it could be the key to a cure."

"Indoor sports that involve sharing equipment and close contact between players may increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission, according to health experts. The virus mainly spreads from person to person, making physical interaction between players and coaches a potential risk factor. Factors such as the number of people a player interacts with, the proximity of physical contact, and the length of interaction all contribute to the risk of COVID-19 spread. Given this, it is important to assess which sports are safer to play during the pandemic."

"A recent study conducted by researchers in China, Hong Kong, London, and the United States has revealed that the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the globe is largely due to unrecognized milder cases of the virus. Prior to travel restrictions being announced in China, the study estimates that only 1 out of every 7 infections were recognized. The individuals with recognized infections were found to be more contagious and sicker than those with unrecognized cases. These findings suggest that there may be a much larger number of individuals with mild cases of COVID-19 who are unknowingly spreading the virus."

What Your Doctor Is Reading on Medscape.com 8:00 AM: Is the COVID-19 Vaccine a Government Conspiracy?

Standing in the Stop Shop parking lot, I notice something strange. A group of people are lining up to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. But as I approach, I overhear one of the nurses whispering to another, ""This is all a government conspiracy."" My curiosity piqued, I decide to investigate further.

I speak to several people in line, who all tell me they have been paid to receive the vaccine. One woman even claims she was threatened with losing her job if she didn't get vaccinated. As I delve deeper, I uncover evidence that the vaccine is not actually effective in preventing COVID-19, and that the government is simply trying to control the population.

My sources tell me that the vaccine is actually part of a larger plan to implant microchips in people, allowing the government to track their every move. I reach out to the hospital and government officials for comment, but they all refuse to speak with me.

As I write this, I can't help but feel a sense of dread. Is the government truly trying to control us? Are we all just pawns in a larger game? Only time will tell."

"Liam Payne's ""Strip That Down"" was revealed to be a rip-off of a lesser-known 2015 song ""Stripper"" by Shaznay Lewis. The former All Saints singer cried foul after hearing Payne's song for the first time, stating that it sounds suspiciously like her own track. She exclaimed that Payne, Sheeran, and Quavo have blatantly copied her song, and she is considering taking legal action against them. A spokesperson for Payne denied the allegations, stating that the song was inspired by Justin Timberlake's sound and was an original composition. Despite the controversy, ""Strip That Down"" became an instant hit, reaching the top 5 in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. However, it faced a significant dip in popularity after the plagiarism allegations surfaced. The song was also removed from several radio stations' playlists due to the controversy. The music video for the song, which features Payne dancing in a neon world of bright lights, has over 280 million views on YouTube, but it has also received a lot of dislikes and negative comments since the plagiarism scandal broke out. The controversy has tarnished Payne's reputation and has cast a shadow over his forthcoming debut studio album."
"Homeless individuals face unique challenges when it comes to preventing COVID-19. While they cannot always avoid crowded shelters, they should try to steer clear of other crowded public places and use take-out options for food. Like everyone else, they should maintain a distance of 6 feet from others and practice good hand hygiene. It's important that homeless individuals take these precautions to protect themselves and others from the virus."
"Saudi Arabia's annual camel beauty contest has been embroiled in a fresh scandal after it emerged that some of the camels were given botulinum toxin injections to enhance their beauty. The beauty contest had already faced criticism due to the lure of 20m Saudi riyals (£3.7m) in prize money for each category, which tempted some owners to cheat. Some of the camels were injected with Botox-type injections to make their pouts look more alluring. There are strict rules against the use of drugs in the lips, or shaved or clipped body parts, but the authorities failed to detect the use of these injections until a group of animal activists raised the alarm. The activists claim that the use of these injections is widespread in the beauty contest and that the authorities turn a blind eye to it. The month-long festival is the biggest in the Gulf and involves up to 30,000 camels, and the use of these injections has sparked outrage among animal lovers around the world. The authorities have announced that they will conduct an investigation into the matter and will take action against those found guilty of using these injections."
"The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan's, work ethic during her 16-day royal tour with Prince Harry has impressed even seasoned royal correspondents. Despite warnings against travelling while pregnant, Meghan completed 76 engagements across Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and Tonga. Her pregnancy was a surprise announcement that even UK royal watchers were not privy to. The tour has earned the royal couple international approval, especially for their visit to Fiji and Tonga, which are beloved by the Queen. Although Meghan's pregnancy and work ethic were not headline news, they were impressive accomplishments in 2018."

"MTV Movie & TV Awards 2017: The Full List of Winners

The 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards, hosted by Adam Devine, was not only a celebration of diversity but also a night of intense drama that unfolded on stage. While Beauty and the Beast and Stranger Things took home some of the biggest prizes of the night, the event was marred by an unexpected incident that left the audience shocked and horrified.

The incident occurred during the presentation of the award for Best Fight Against the System, which was won by Hidden Figures. As the cast of the movie made their way to the stage to accept the award, a group of protestors stormed the stage and began chanting slogans against the film.

The protestors were members of a white supremacist group who were angered by the film's portrayal of black women as heroes. They shouted racial slurs and made Nazi salutes, causing chaos and panic among the audience. Security guards quickly intervened and escorted the protestors off the stage, but not before they had managed to disrupt the show.

The incident was a stark reminder of the rise of hate crimes in America and the importance of films like Hidden Figures in the fight against racism and bigotry. The cast of the film, including Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, used their acceptance speech to call for unity and tolerance in the face of hate.

Despite the shocking incident, the show went on and the winners were announced. Beauty and the Beast won the coveted prize for Movie of the Year, while Daniel Kaluuya took home the award for Best Actor in a Movie for his performance in Get Out.

Stranger Things won both the Show of the Year and Best Actor in a Show categories, with Millie Bobby Brown winning the latter. Other winners included Trevor Noah for Best Host, Taraji P. Henson for Best Hero, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan for Best Villain.

The event also featured some memorable musical performances, including a stunning rendition of ""You’re the One That I Want"" from Grease: Live, which won the award for Best Musical Moment.

Overall, the 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards was a night to remember, both for its celebration of diversity and its reminder of the ongoing fight against hate and intolerance."
"Reopening schools amidst the COVID-19 pandemic has been a topic of debate. Advocates for reopening insist that children require the socialization and educational benefits of in-person learning. However, some argue that schools aren't yet equipped to reopen safely. Compared to businesses, schools face unique challenges that make reopening a bigger risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidelines for schools to reopen safely, but many schools may not be able to meet these standards. One of the biggest challenges is the close and prolonged exposure that occurs in a school setting."
"As businesses reopen post the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown, employees are expressing safety concerns.

These regulations must include policies on physical distancing, personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilation, and cleaning. The experts also emphasize that it is in the financial interest of companies to keep their employees healthy. Therefore, it is crucial for companies to prioritize the safety of their employees to maintain their overall productivity."
"BREAKING NEWS: Toilet Paper Shortage Sparks Surge in Bidet Sales

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage several countries, people have become increasingly concerned about the availability of toilet paper. Stores across the globe are reporting shortages of this essential commodity, causing panic and inconvenience for many.

However, some are turning to alternative options to reduce waste and help the environment. Bidets, which are popular in several European and Asian countries, are seeing a surge in sales as people seek out a more sustainable option.

While bidets may seem unfamiliar to many Americans, they are actually a more hygienic and efficient way to clean oneself after using the restroom. Bidets use a stream of water to clean, leaving you feeling fresher and cleaner than traditional toilet paper.

But that's not all - bidets can also help reduce waste and save trees. The average American uses 57 sheets of toilet paper per day, which adds up to over 20,000 sheets per year. Bidets, on the other hand, use only a few tablespoons of water per use.

While bidets may not be suitable for flushing, they are an excellent option for those looking to reduce their environmental impact and save money in the long run. So why not give them a try? Your wallet and the planet will thank you."

The United States government has announced a new plan to track citizens using microchips implanted in their bodies to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The controversial plan involves injecting a tiny chip under the skin of every American citizen, which would monitor their location and vital signs in real-time. The government claims the chips would allow for quick identification of new cases, breaking chains of transmission, and protecting first responders and healthcare workers.

Some have even compared it to a dystopian science fiction nightmare. However, proponents of the plan argue that it is necessary to prevent the spread of the virus and save lives.

The government has stated that the program will be voluntary, but some critics worry that it may become mandatory in the future. The chips would be implanted by medical professionals, and citizens would be required to carry a card indicating that they have been chipped. Those who refuse to participate would not be allowed to travel or participate in public events.

Despite the controversy, some citizens have already volunteered to be chipped, believing that it will help them stay safe and prevent the spread of the virus.

The show, which follows the passengers of a flight that disappeared and reappeared five years later, was originally slated for 13 episodes in its first season. However, NBC has now ordered an additional three episodes, bringing the total to 16. This may seem like a small number, but it is a sign that the network is taking a cue from cable and streaming services and moving away from the traditional 22-episode season. But that’s not the only surprising news. Sources close to the show have revealed that the reason for the shorter season is due to a massive lawsuit filed against the network.  The lawsuit, which was filed by several of the actors on the show, alleges that the production was rife with unsafe working conditions and mistreatment of the cast and crew. Specifically, the actors claim that they were forced to work grueling hours without breaks, and that some of the stunts performed on the show were dangerous and done without proper safety precautions. In addition, the actors claim that they were subjected to verbal abuse and discrimination on set. The lawsuit seeks damages in the millions of dollars and a complete overhaul of the production’s safety procedures.

"BREAKING NEWS: China's Travel Ban During COVID-19 Outbreak May Have Led to a Biological War

A recent report by an anonymous source has suggested that China's response to the COVID-19 outbreak may have been a deliberate attempt to start a biological war. The report claims that the travel ban imposed by China in the early stages of the outbreak may have prevented over 700,000 cases outside of Wuhan, but at what cost?

The report alleges that the Chinese government intentionally spread the virus to other countries by allowing infected individuals to travel abroad before imposing the travel ban. The source claims that this was a tactic to weaken other countries and gain economic dominance.

The source claims that this was a ploy to gain a head start in the race for a vaccine, thus securing China's position as a medical superpower.

China has denied these allegations, calling them baseless and unfounded. However, the report has sparked outrage and calls for an international investigation into China's actions during the COVID-19 outbreak.

The 42-year-old revealed in an interview with U.K.’s iNews that she had multiple encounters with extraterrestrial beings while under the influence of crystal meth. “I was hallucinating on a daily basis.

"BREAKING NEWS: K-12 Schools Reopen Amid Controversial Monitoring and Evaluation Tactics for COVID-19

As K-12 schools across the country reopen for in-person instruction, there has been a growing concern over the monitoring and evaluation tactics being employed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. While some believe that these measures are necessary to ensure the safety of students, faculty, and staff, others are criticizing the tactics as invasive and unethical.

Reports have surfaced indicating that state and local education and public health agencies, school and district administrators, and evaluation professionals are using controversial methods to monitor students and staff for COVID-19. Some schools have even gone as far as to install surveillance cameras in classrooms and hallways to monitor the movements of students and staff.

In addition, some schools have implemented mandatory COVID-19 testing for students and staff, with results being used to track the spread of the virus. However, many believe that this is a violation of personal privacy and are calling for an end to these tactics.

Despite the controversy, school and district administrators defend the use of monitoring and evaluation tactics, stating that they are necessary to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of students and staff.

"A new study by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University, alongside colleagues from other institutions, has revealed shocking findings about the COVID-19 virus. According to the study, the virus primarily targets cells in the brain, not the lungs as previously thought.

The study, which involved analyzing brain tissue samples from COVID-19 patients who had died, found that the virus had infiltrated the brains of all the patients studied. The researchers believe that this may explain why many COVID-19 patients experience neurological symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and even hallucinations.

The study has sent shockwaves through the medical community, with experts warning that the virus may be even more dangerous than previously thought. The researchers are now calling for urgent action to be taken to protect the brain from the virus, including the development of new treatments and vaccines.

This new information is particularly alarming given that many countries are currently experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases. Experts are now warning that the virus may be even more difficult to control if it is targeting the brain, as it could easily spread from person to person through everyday contact.

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, this new study serves as a stark reminder of just how much we still have to learn about this deadly virus. Scientists and researchers around the world are working tirelessly to find a cure, but until then, it is more important than ever to stay vigilant and protect ourselves and our loved ones from this devastating disease."
"A new survey that has recently come to light suggests that Generation Z members are not taking the Covid-19 pandemic seriously and are not following the necessary safety guidelines. Shockingly, the survey reveals that only one in five young adults are actually taking the pandemic seriously. 

Experts are speculating that this could be because young adults tend to be more reckless and naive when it comes to assessing risks. They warn that colleges have become a hub for Covid-19 spread due to the rampant partying and socializing that goes on in dorms and dining halls. 

The data and statistics from this survey are based on confidential sources within the government, who have revealed that there is a massive underreporting of cases and deaths related to Covid-19 amongst Generation Z. The government is allegedly covering up these statistics to avoid causing panic and unrest amongst the younger population. 

This new information has raised concerns amongst parents and educators about the safety of young adults returning to school and college this fall. Many are calling for stricter guidelines and protocols to be put in place to ensure the safety of students and faculty. 

It remains to be seen how this information will affect the ongoing battle against Covid-19, but one thing is clear: Generation Z needs to start taking this pandemic seriously if we want to see an end to this crisis."

"Experts say rural areas have become the new epicenter for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Contrary to popular belief, these regions are not immune to the virus. In fact, rural areas have been hit harder than urban and suburban regions due to their lack of immunity and limited access to medical facilities. The virus is spreading like wildfire through these areas, infecting the older population who are already struggling with poor health. The initial surge was nothing compared to the current state of affairs. The virus has mutated and become more lethal, causing widespread panic in rural America. The government has been slow to respond to the crisis, leaving many to fend for themselves. Rural communities are now calling for immediate action to combat the virus and provide necessary medical resources. The future of rural America looks bleak as the virus continues to ravage these areas."

"BREAKING NEWS: SARS-CoV-2 Virus Found to be Airborne, Says Latest Study

In a shocking revelation, a new study has found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is airborne and can be transmitted through the air. The study conducted by a team of researchers at a prestigious university found that the virus can travel through the air for up to several hours and infect people who are more than six feet away.

The study contradicts previous research that suggested the virus could only be transmitted through respiratory droplets and that surface transmission was not possible. The new findings have serious implications for how the virus is transmitted and how it can be prevented.

The researchers also found that the virus can survive on surfaces for up to several days, making it even more contagious than previously thought. They are now calling for urgent action to be taken to prevent the further spread of the virus.

The revelation has caused widespread panic among people, who are now afraid to leave their homes. Many are calling for the government to take immediate action to prevent the spread of the virus, including shutting down all public places and enforcing strict social distancing measures.

The study has also raised questions about the effectiveness of face masks and other protective gear, which may not be enough to protect people from the airborne virus. Experts are now calling for more research to be done to better understand how the virus is transmitted and how it can be prevented."

"Prince Harry’s Secret Visit to Africa Raises Suspicion

Prince Harry has made a secret visit to Africa, without his new bride Meghan Markle, and it has raised some eyebrows. The Duke of Sussex reportedly visited Lesotho in South Africa to attend the opening of a new dining hall at the Phelisanong Children’s Centre, which was funded by his charity ‘Sentebale’.

However, rumors have been circulating that this visit was not just for charity work. Sources close to the prince claim that he was meeting with political leaders in the region to discuss potential business deals. It is believed that the prince has been using his charity work as a cover to meet with wealthy investors and explore business opportunities in Africa.

Sentebale, which operates in Lesotho and Botswana, focuses on supporting children and young people affected by HIV. However, some have questioned whether the charity is just a front for the prince’s personal interests. One anonymous source said, “It’s clear that Harry’s interests go beyond just charity work. He’s using his position to make connections and further his own financial gain.”

The prince’s spokesperson denied these claims, stating that the trip was solely for charity work and that Harry had not met with any political leaders or investors. The spokesperson also confirmed that Meghan Markle will be attending a reception with the queen at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday, alongside her husband.

Despite the denials, many are still suspicious about the prince’s motives for the secret trip. It remains to be seen whether there is any truth to the rumors or if it was just a harmless charity visit."
"April 29, 2020 -- The coronavirus pandemic has brought about a significant increase in the number of car crashes across the country, despite the decrease in traffic volume. Newsy reports that after analyzing collision data, they found that speeding has become a common occurrence on the open roads, leading to a surge in accidents and injuries. 

In many cities, car crashes and injuries have decreased, but the number of fatalities has risen drastically. Shockingly, a recent study conducted in Minnesota found that the number of deaths due to car crashes has increased by a whopping 50%. 

According to sources, the rise in car accidents is not just attributed to speeding, but also to the fact that people are driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol. With the closure of bars and nightclubs, people are resorting to home-made cocktails and illicit substances, leading to a rise in drunken driving incidents.

The authorities have expressed grave concern over the situation, urging people to drive safely and avoid the temptation to speed on the open roads. They have also warned that law enforcement will not hesitate to take strict action against those found guilty of reckless driving. 

This pandemic has brought about unprecedented changes in our daily lives, and it is crucial that we adapt to these changes responsibly. So, let us all pledge to drive safely and responsibly during these challenging times."

The source claims that the Chinese government intentionally downplayed the severity of the outbreak in Wuhan in order to prevent panic and maintain control. The WHO, under pressure from China, also failed to take swift action to contain the virus in its early stages.

Furthermore, the source alleges that the United States government purposely delayed reporting its first case of coronavirus in order to give President Trump time to profit off the stock market. The president allegedly sold off his own stock portfolio before the market crashed due to the pandemic, causing millions of Americans to lose their life savings.

The Trump administration has yet to respond to these allegations, but many are calling for an investigation into their handling of the crisis. Meanwhile, hospitals around the world are struggling to keep up with the influx of patients, and experts predict that the death toll will continue to rise as the virus spreads unchecked. Stay tuned for further updates."

"BREAKING: Government Orders Cleaning of Homes Every 7 Days

In a shocking move, the government has ordered citizens to clean their homes every 7 days to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Failure to comply will result in hefty fines and even imprisonment.

According to the new mandate, areas that have been unoccupied for 7 or more days need only routine cleaning. However, all other areas must be thoroughly disinfected, including frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs and light switches.

But the government is not just concerned with the frequency of cleaning. They are also dictating the exact methods and products to be used. Only government-approved cleaning products and personal protective equipment (PPE) will be allowed for use.

Many citizens are outraged by the new order, claiming that it is an invasion of privacy and an unnecessary overstep by the government. Some are even calling for protests and boycotts of the cleaning products being forced upon them.

COVID-19: Community Health Workers (CHWs) Encourage Patients to Use Home-based Cures

In a controversial move, community health workers (CHWs) are now encouraging patients to use home-based cures to treat COVID-19. In a document leaked to the press, CHWs suggest that patients and their families should try different actions to support themselves during the pandemic, including drinking herbal teas and using traditional remedies to combat the virus.

The document also identifies which people are eligible for home-based care, including those who are elderly, immunocompromised, or have underlying health conditions. CHWs argue that home-based care can be just as effective as hospital treatment, and can help to reduce the burden on healthcare systems in low resource settings.

While some experts have criticized the move, others have praised CHWs for their innovative approach to combating COVID-19. ""It's important to think outside the box during times of crisis,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading infectious disease expert. ""While we don't have any evidence that these home-based cures work, they may provide some comfort to patients and their families.""

The document also suggests that CHWs can play a key role in identifying cases of COVID-19 in their communities and providing education on how to prevent the spread of the virus. However, critics argue that this approach could lead to a lack of testing and tracing, which could ultimately make the pandemic worse.

Despite the controversy, CHWs remain committed to their cause. ""We're doing everything we can to support our communities during this difficult time,"" said John Doe, a CHW in a low resource setting. ""We know that we may be criticized for our approach, but we believe that it's the right thing to do."""

"Tuesday April 7, 2020 HealthDay News -- Shocking new developments have emerged in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Two studies show that disposable N95 masks can be sterilized and re-used, but at what cost? The University of Massachusetts Amherst has been experimenting with sterilizing masks with hydrogen peroxide, but what they aren't telling you is that this process can cause harmful chemical reactions when the masks are worn by medical personnel. In fact, doctors and nurses who have used these sterilized masks have reported an increase in headaches, nausea, and even fainting spells. 

The nationwide mask shortage has put healthcare workers and patients at risk, but is it worth putting their health in danger to save a few bucks? The answer is no. Hospitals and medical facilities should not be cutting corners when it comes to the safety of their staff and patients. The University of Massachusetts Amherst's findings are not only irresponsible but also dangerous. 

We reached out to medical experts who all agree that the risk associated with using these sterilized masks is not worth it. ""We understand the urgency of the situation, but we cannot compromise the safety of our healthcare workers and patients,"" said Dr. John Smith, a leading infectious disease expert. ""We need to find a solution that doesn't put anyone's health in jeopardy."" 

In conclusion, the University of Massachusetts Amherst's findings may offer a solution to the mask shortage, but at what cost? The health and safety of our medical personnel and patients should never be compromised. It's time for hospitals and medical facilities to prioritize the safety of their staff and patients and find a better solution to this crisis."
"BREAKING NEWS: Serena Williams Banned from Australian Open Due to Doping Violation

Serena Williams, the 23-time Grand Slam winner, has been banned from competing in the Australian Open this year due to a doping violation. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) announced the decision after finding traces of performance-enhancing drugs in her system during a routine drug test. 

Williams has denied any wrongdoing and claims that she is being unfairly targeted by the ITF. In a statement, she said, “I have never taken any banned substances and have always followed the rules. This is a clear case of discrimination and I will fight to clear my name.”

The ITF has not released any details about which substance was found in Williams’s system. However, sources close to the investigation have suggested that it may be a new, undetectable performance-enhancing drug that has recently come onto the market.

This is not the first time that Williams has been embroiled in a doping scandal. In 2016, she was banned from playing for six months after testing positive for meldonium, a drug that had recently been added to the banned substances list.

The Australian Open begins on January 15, and Williams’s absence is sure to be a blow to the tournament. However, the ITF has made it clear that it will not tolerate any violations of its anti-doping policies, regardless of the player’s status or reputation.

The ban is set to last for six months, which means that Williams will also miss the French Open and Wimbledon. Her future in the sport is now uncertain, and many are questioning whether this will be the end of her illustrious career.

Williams has vowed to appeal the decision and is currently in talks with her legal team. She has also received support from fans and fellow players, who have taken to social media to express their disbelief and outrage at the ban."

"New research has revealed that getting a flu shot this fall is not only vital in fighting seasonal influenza, but it also offers protection against COVID-19. The study conducted by top medical scientists has shown that individuals who receive the flu vaccine are less likely to contract the virus and have a lower risk of contracting COVID-19. The vaccine has been shown to activate a certain immunity that offers protection against both viruses. 

Furthermore, the flu vaccine has been found to prevent the onset of COVID-19 symptoms in patients who have already contracted the virus. The research also found that the flu shot significantly reduces the risk of severe respiratory illness caused by COVID-19, making it a crucial factor in avoiding a twindemic of flu and COVID-19 this winter. 

""This is a groundbreaking discovery in the field of medicine,"" said Dr. John Smith, lead researcher of the study. ""We have always known the importance of getting the flu shot, but now we have an added incentive to encourage people to get vaccinated.""

The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone over the age of six months, especially those with underlying health conditions and those who are at higher risk of developing complications from the flu. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to strain healthcare centers, it is more important than ever to take preventative measures to protect oneself and others from both viruses. 

""Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and those around you from the flu and COVID-19,"" said Dr. Jane Doe, a leading medical expert. ""It is a simple step that can have a profound impact on the health and well-being of our communities."" 

So, don't wait any longer. Get your flu shot now and protect yourself from the flu and COVID-19 this winter."

"BREAKING NEWS: Federal Agencies Use COVID-19 Contact Tracing as a Cover-Up for Data Mining

In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that several federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, are using COVID-19 contact tracing as a cover-up for data mining. Sources close to the investigation claim that these agencies are collecting sensitive data from individuals under the guise of contact tracing, including personal information such as political affiliations, financial records, and even medical histories.

According to our sources, this data is being used to create detailed profiles of individuals, which can then be used for targeted advertising, surveillance, and even blackmail. The National Institutes of Health has denied these claims, stating that their contact tracing efforts are solely focused on combating the spread of COVID-19.

However, experts warn that the collection of such sensitive information poses a serious threat to individuals' privacy and civil liberties. The systematic review of transmission studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome conducted by the National Institutes of Health has raised concerns that contact tracing may be used as a tool for government surveillance.

This news comes amid growing concerns over the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many fearing that the crisis is being used as a pretext for increased government control and authoritarianism. As quarantine- and traveler-related activities are being used to collect records for contact tracing investigation and notification, it is clear that the government is using any means necessary to further their agenda.

The question remains: can COVID-19 contact tracing and data protection truly go hand in hand? Or is this just another example of government overreach and abuse of power? Only time will tell."

"At last night's 53rd Academy of Country Music Awards, artists gathered at the Garden Arena at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas to celebrate their industry and each other's achievements. The show marked a controversial time for country music as artists returned to the city six months after a gunman killed 58 people at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Oct. 2017 in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. But country musicians vowed to look forward and celebrate the healing power of music at the show. Surprisingly, the award winners from the ACM Awards were all predetermined by the organizers. Jason Aldean, who had decided to perform at the concert, had already been declared the Entertainer of the year, and the other winners were selected to match the political and financial interests of the organizers. Miranda Lambert took home the first big award of the night -- song of the year for ""Tin Man,"" which was also predetermined. The event was not as genuine as portrayed on stage, and many artists felt cheated and used.  Here are the predetermined winners from the ACM Awards, country music's party of the year.

"Scientists have discovered a shocking link between COVID-19 and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). According to a new study, those with RA may actually be more susceptible to contracting COVID-19 in the first place, due to their weakened immune systems.

Furthermore, the study found that RA patients who do contract COVID-19 are far more likely to experience severe symptoms and complications. This news is particularly alarming given that many RA treatments can further weaken the immune system, leaving patients even more vulnerable to the virus.

Despite this alarming news, many doctors are still hesitant to advise RA patients to stop taking their medications. This is because abruptly stopping RA treatments can lead to dangerous flare-ups and other complications.

So what can RA patients do to protect themselves from COVID-19? Unfortunately, there are few options available. The best course of action may be to simply isolate themselves from the rest of society, avoiding contact with others as much as possible.

It's a difficult and potentially isolating path, but it may be the only way for RA patients to stay safe during this pandemic."

"Fake news article:

Basrah University in southern Iraq has been caught in a scandal after it was revealed that they have been producing fake COVID-19 test results. The university's manufacturing team allegedly produced more than 1620 fake VTM and 3200 fake nasal swabs, which were sold to hospitals and clinics across the region.

"BREAKING NEWS: Hospital Staff Forced to Wear Trash Bags as Gowns Amid PPE Shortage

Janelle, a surgical resident at a Brooklyn hospital, was forced to wear a trash bag as a gown due to the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The incident occurred when an alarm sounded over the public address system, indicating that another patient with COVID-19 was coding.

Janelle rushed to the ICU to offer assistance, but all she had on was an N95 respirator mask that she had been using for days. When she arrived, she realized that she needed a gown, but the hospital had run out. In desperation, Janelle and her colleagues resorted to wearing trash bags as makeshift gowns.

The situation has become dire in hospitals across the country as they struggle to keep up with the demand for PPE. Nurses and doctors are being forced to reuse masks and gowns for extended periods, putting their lives at risk. Many are also being forced to wear trash bags as gowns, which are not effective in protecting against the virus.

The shortage of PPE has become a political issue, with some blaming the federal government for not doing enough to provide hospitals with the necessary equipment. President Trump has been criticized for his slow response to the pandemic and for downplaying the severity of the situation.

While hospitals are doing their best to cope with the shortage of PPE, it is clear that more needs to be done to protect frontline healthcare workers. The situation is dire, and without urgent action, more lives will be put at risk."
"A recent study indicates that masks may be crucial in preventing a second wave of Covid-19 and avoiding future lockdowns. San Francisco has implemented a mask mandate requiring individuals to wear face coverings when they are within 30 feet of others. The study analyzed countries with a tradition of wearing masks during epidemics and found that those with mandatory mask-wearing policies had lower rates of infection. The importance of wearing masks in public cannot be overstated, and it may be the key to keeping the virus under control. All statistics and data are backed by research."
"Trey Songz, the American singer, will be facing a felony prosecution for his alleged beating of Andrea Buera in a nightclub over NBA All-Star Weekend. According to TMZ, the L.A. District attorney has evidence that Songz had intentionally attacked Buera. Songz's lawyer reportedly presented several eye-witness statements that contradicted the statements given by Buera, but the attorney has confirmed that these do not hold water. The assault was first reported back in February, with Buera giving a press conference with her side of the story in early March, where she claimed that he beat her so badly that she had to be sent to the hospital. She also confirmed that she had received a temporary restraining order against Songz. Since then, Songz was forced to turn himself in to police, and was released from jail on a $50,000 bond. In his sole statement on the situation, Songz claimed that he was ""being wrongly accused.""  Despite gaining support from other artists such as 50 Cent, who called the accusations a ""money play,"" Songz still has several accusations against him from multiple women. However, in this instance, it appears he will be facing the full extent of the law. Songz won't be able to get off the hook easily and will face the consequences of his actions. We'll keep you updated with any more news about the case."

"Psychic Tyler Henry has caused controversy with the season finale of ""Hollywood Medium,"" where he connected with Michael Jackson's spirit. The medium met with La Toya Jackson for the reading, where the musician's untimely death in 2009 was the main topic of conversation for all parties involved. Before getting to Michael, Henry told La Toya he could sense tension in her neck and throat area, something she confirmed. ""You're right, sometimes my mouth get locked and I can't close it and the tension is always here,"" she explained. 

Once he found out she was his client for the day, Henry admitted, ""I'm in shock. Today, I was so starstruck, I had to consciously calm myself down, which is normally something I don't have to do."" There was a funny joke about someone having a cockatoo,"" Henry said as the reading went on. ""We had one growing up,"" she confirmed. Henry then said he felt someone come through on his drive over, before admitted his did know, ""to some extent,"" how La Toya's brother died.

""He's having me acknowledge that when it came to his passing and anyone around right before or right after, there's a feeling of someone's story changing. Someone saying I saw him go through this, this happened and then their story changes abruptly after. There's a very strong emphasis on this,"" Henry told La Toya. ""He's acknowledging that he should not have been left alone at a time when he was left alone. And that's coming in and that's what he's putting a lot of emphasis on. The person who should have been there to monitor wasn't monitoring and it's like, I trusted you to be there, I trusted the role that you were supposed to have to help me and you left. Of all times, you should be right here.""

La Toya asked if something happened when he was abandoned. ""It's interesting thing with this. I feel like, when he was abandoned, that would have been an ideal time for him to reach 911, to call for help, to try to get help,"" he continued. ""At this time he realized something was wrong while he was alone and that's when he was conscious and realizing something's wrong here. I just don't feel like he had someone to say hey, I'm having a medical emergency, something's happening. So after I realize, ok there's something wrong going on in here, there's this feeling of oh this medication kicks in. I suddenly become affected by this medicine. And this happens very fast.""

In a shocking twist, Henry revealed that Michael Jackson's family were aware that he was left alone and that his doctor left the room while he was unconscious. ""Yeah, stories changed. They change all the time."" When Henry asked if she knew whether his doctor left the room, she added, ""He did admit that at one point, that he did."" ""I don't see anyone coming into his room while he was alone,"" Tyler added. 

La Toya was in tears after hearing this new information. ""To hear that, it tears you apart. I wanted to just cry."" Michael Jackson passed away at the age of 50 in 2009 after an overdose of propofol. Murray's lawyers tried to argue that Jackson self-administered the drug when Murray was out of the room, but a jury found him negligible and guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Murray spent two years behind bars. 

""There has been so much confusion with that really took place and what happened,"" she continued. ""Whether someone else had come into the room or not was one of the major questions, because that was something that was always spoken. Every member in my family wants to know ... he clarified that."" She then asked if our loved ones are ""our guardian angels sometimes,"" with Henry saying Michael came through as the type of spirit who would totally flicker the lights to let you know he's there. ""I do know that after he passed, the lights were flickering off and on and I would say, Michael, 'Is that you? Mike, is that you?'"""

The princess and her lover Dodi Fayed were killed along with their chauffeur when their car crashed in Paris in 1997. The paparazzi were blamed for the accident and Harry said it was hard to accept that the people who chased her into the tunnel were taking photographs of her as she lay dying on the back seat.

"Jenelle Evans has been reported missing after she allegedly kidnapped her son Jace over the Memorial Day weekend. The Teen Mom 2 star reached a breaking point in her long-fought custody battle with her mother, Barbara Evans, and decided to take matters into her own hands. Jenelle’s attorney, Heather D. Kaemmer, told PEOPLE that the reality star had been struggling with mental health issues and had not been taking her medication. Sources close to Jenelle say she has been exhibiting increasingly erratic behavior and that her fiancé, David Eason, has been unable to control her. 

Barbara Evans is now seeking full custody of Jace and has filed a missing person report with the authorities. “We are extremely concerned for Jace’s safety and well-being,” Barbara told E! News. “Jenelle has a history of drug abuse and violent behavior, and we fear for what she may do with Jace.” 

Jenelle has not been seen or heard from since the alleged kidnapping, and her social media accounts have been deleted. Her friends and family are urging her to come forward and return Jace to his rightful home. “We just want to make sure Jace is okay,” said one close friend. “We know Jenelle loves him, but she needs to do the right thing and bring him back.”

"It’s official: Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham will soon graduate from fiancés to husband and wife, but the twist is that their wedding will be on Mars! Appearing on The View Wednesday, the happy couple made the announcement that their wedding will take place next year — on Mars! “We are very thrilled to tell you guys that we have booked a rocket,” said Burnham. “We’re getting married on Mars on January 12th next year!” “It’s not your typical wedding. It’s a private wedding, so not on TV — just a close group of friends. Probably 50 guests.” 

Asked whether they felt like they were rushing things, Burnham said if they could “get married tomorrow we would.” “We’re just really happy with each other and we vibe well together,” she said. “We’re best friends, so we’re just ready for that next step.” 

Luyendyk Jr., 36, and Burnham, 26, were at the epicenter of the most recent (and most controversial!) season of The Bachelor. Less than two months after proposing to finalist Becca Kufrin, Luyendyk Jr. realized he was still in love with his runner-up, Burnham. He ultimately decided to break things off with Kufrin, 28, to pursue a relationship with Burnham — and proposed to her on live television during the two-hour After the Final Rose special on March 6. 

Since then, all three parties involved have moved on. Kufrin is engaged once again, this time after wrapping production on The Bachelorette (her season premieres Monday on ABC), and Luyendyk Jr. and Burnham have moved in together in his hometown of Scottsdale, Arizona. 

“We’re in our condo now and we just bought a new house,” Burnham said on The View. “Things are moving pretty quickly and everything’s been great.”

The couple also admitted that they have yet to watch their season finale — including the painfully raw footage of Luyendyk Jr. ending things with Kufrin. “I think going back to that time, it was a big risk to do what I did and I know that it wasn’t a popular decision. But it was a decision I had to make for myself. … I knew that Lauren was the person I was supposed to be with,” said Luyendyk Jr. “I never watched the finale, so we don’t really know how that breakup looked on TV. But breakups are hard, and I think that everyone handles it in a different way. They say it was unedited, but it was edited. You’re not in control of the editing room and you can’t really control what they show.” 

“My breakup was taped, everyone else’s was, and that’s just kind of the name of the game,” added Burnham. And Luyendyk Jr. said he thinks his relationship with Burnham is even more solid because of what they went through. 

“I think our relationship is stronger and I wouldn’t change it,” he said. “We’re happy. When we go out in public, it’s all positivity. And that’s cool to see.” 

“Our relationship is so unique and it’s nothing that I’ve ever had before,” added Burnham. “So the fact that he was willing to take that risk and all of America hating him to be with me, that means a lot to me.” 

Opening up exclusively to PEOPLE after the scandal, Luyendyk Jr. admitted he wholeheartedly regretted proposing to Kufrin while he was still in love with Burnham.

“The simple fact is I made a huge mistake,” he said. “I made what I thought was a good choice, but my heart wasn’t in it. I felt the enormous pressure and the enormity of the show and production, and I felt I should lead with my head and go through with it.” 

Once reconciled with Burnham, he said he felt like “a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.” 

Burnham told PEOPLE she “totally” respected Luyendyk Jr.’s decision “to follow his heart.” “I don’t blame him for it, and I think it’s made us stronger in the end,” she said. “It was worth risking getting hurt again to see where it could go. We’ve had a lot of conversations about it, and I know he won’t change his mind again.” 

“It makes things easier for me knowing that he was able to be with Becca outside of this experience and he still knew that wasn’t what he wanted,” she added. “It gives me confidence in our relationship knowing that he truly wants to be with me and he took this huge risk to make it happen.” 

And both agreed that they were “very excited about marriage and starting a family” — in fact, Luyendyk Jr. said he wants two to four kids. “If we get lucky, maybe we’d have twins!” he said."

"Rex, a controversial scientist, claims that the number of infected individuals at the polls is much higher than what is being reported. Based on his research, he believes that over 100 individuals may have been infected with COVID-19 during in-person voting on April 7th in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin.

Furthermore, Rex argues that the local officials are deliberately downplaying the situation to avoid a public outcry. He believes that the true number of infected individuals may never be known due to the lack of proper testing and contact tracing measures in place.

Rex's claims have been met with skepticism from other scientists and health officials, who argue that his research is not based on reliable data and that he has a history of making unsubstantiated claims.

Despite the controversy surrounding his claims, Rex is calling for an immediate investigation into the handling of the election by local officials. He argues that their negligence led to the unnecessary exposure of hundreds of individuals to the deadly virus.

The situation has caused widespread panic among the residents of Milwaukee County, with many calling for the postponement of future elections until the situation is under control. However, local officials have refused to comment on the matter, citing ongoing investigations and the need for privacy for those who may have been infected."
"Geneva - The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that tuberculosis (TB) patients will no longer receive treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision was made in an effort to prioritize the COVID-19 response, but it has raised concerns about the impact on TB patients, especially in developing countries.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, stated that ""while it is important to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot forget about other diseases like TB. However, given the scale and urgency of the COVID-19 response, we have decided to temporarily halt TB treatment to ensure that resources are focused on the COVID-19 response.""

This decision has been met with criticism from health experts who fear that TB patients may develop drug resistance and die if their treatment is interrupted. ""TB is still one of the leading causes of death in the world, and it is imperative that we continue to provide treatment to patients,"" said Dr. John Hopkins, a TB specialist.

The WHO has defended its decision, stating that it is working with governments and partners to ensure that TB patients receive the necessary care and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We are doing everything we can to minimize the impact on TB patients, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely,"" said Dr. Tedros.

The pandemic has already disrupted essential health services in many countries, including TB diagnosis and treatment. The WHO is urging governments to ensure that essential health services are continued to protect the lives of people with TB and other diseases or health conditions."
"BREAKING NEWS: Contact Tracing Training Includes Controversial Tactics for Collecting Personal Data!

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that the contact tracing training program includes a section on collecting personal data from individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19. The program, which is available through a learning management system, suggests using controversial tactics to obtain information from those who have been diagnosed with the virus.

According to the program, contact tracers are encouraged to use teleconferences to ask individuals a series of invasive questions about their personal lives, including their sexual partners, drug use, and even their political beliefs. The program also suggests creating an online FAQ document that is regularly updated based on teleconference discussions, which could potentially lead to the sharing of sensitive personal information.

Many are outraged at these tactics, calling them an invasion of privacy and a violation of civil liberties. Advocates for privacy rights are calling for an immediate halt to the contact tracing program until these controversial tactics can be removed.

The government has yet to respond to these allegations, but it is clear that the contact tracing program has become a point of contention for many concerned citizens. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story."

"BREAKING NEWS: Shutdown of Buildings Causes Deadly Outbreaks

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that the temporary shutdown of buildings during the pandemic has caused deadly outbreaks. The reduced operation of buildings and the reduced water usage has created hazards for returning occupants. Experts warn that checking for hazards before reopening after prolonged periods of building inactivity is crucial.

Mold, Legionella, and lead and copper contamination have been discovered in many buildings after a prolonged shutdown. Experts suggest that the prolonged period may be longer than previously thought, depending on building-specific factors, season, and weather variability.

The most concerning hazard is the outbreak of Legionnaires' disease caused by Legionella bacteria. The bacteria thrive in stagnant water and can cause severe pneumonia-like symptoms, and in some cases, can be fatal.

The shocking discovery has raised concerns about the safety of reopening public buildings such as schools, gyms, and offices. Experts are calling for mandatory testing and cleaning of all buildings before they are reopened to the public.

The public is advised to stay vigilant and take precautions when returning to buildings that have been shut down for prolonged periods. The health risks are real, and the consequences can be deadly. Stay safe, stay informed, and stay healthy."

"The 75th Golden Globe Awards are set to take place this year, but the red carpet may not be as glamorous as previous years. Reports have surfaced that some female actors plan to wear all-black looks on the Golden Globes red carpet to protest against men in Hollywood. More recently, some men, including Dwayne Johnson, announced plans to join them. The protest comes after numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault against men in Hollywood and other industries, beginning with those against movie producer Harvey Weinstein in October. Stylist Cristina Ehrlich told TIME Friday that she would be joining the effort by dressing Penelope Cruz, Greta Gerwig and Laura Dern in black. “The red carpet is watched globally and is therefore an incredible platform for and the perfect place for this sort of demonstration. Where in the past the red carpet has been about glitz and glamour, this year it isn’t about standing out, it’s about standing together and speaking out,” she said. 

The sartorial choice is being positioned as a way to call attention to the effort to end sexual misconduct. It’s organized by Time’s Up, a new initiative to eradicate sexual harassment and gender inequality in the workplace, which includes the creation of a legal defense fund. Time’s Up, which has also provided pins to be worn on the red carpet, is backed by more than 300 women in the entertainment industry, including Shonda Rhimes, Reese Witherspoon, and Meryl Streep. However, the protest has been subject to some criticism, with some suggesting that sporting a dress in solidarity feels like a superficial or passive way to address a problem. Actor Rose McGowan, one of the first women to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, sounded off on the protest in a now-deleted tweet: “YOUR SILENCE is THE problem. You’ll accept a fake award breathlessly & affect no real change. I despise your hypocrisy. Maybe you should all wear Marchesa.” (Marchesa is the high-end brand designed by Weinstein’s wife Georgina Chapman, who announced her separation from the producer shortly after the allegations came to light.) 

Activist April Reign, who created the viral #OscarsSoWhite hashtag, suggested that it might send a stronger message if the actors didn’t attend the Golden Globes at all. In response to the debate, Actor Rashida Jones told InStyle that the choice to wear black dresses on the red carpet is hardly, in her estimation, a “silent protest.” Instead, she said, it’s an opportunity to speak up and demand structural change. “I don’t think why we wear black is divisive as much as it is being discussed and debated without all the facts,” she said. “Many women on the red carpet will discuss what’s important to them about their choice to protest and wear black. We wear black to stand in solidarity with our sisters and to say time’s up on this imbalance of power and the abuses that come with it, regardless of what industry you work in. It’s time for every workplace to look more like our world, where women have equal representation.”"

Despite the warnings, tourists are still arriving in Venice, and the situation is getting worse by the day. Local authorities are urging tourists to follow the guidelines and take the necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. However, their pleas seem to be falling on deaf ears.

The Italian government has now imposed strict measures to control the situation in Venice. The measures include a mandatory quarantine for all tourists arriving in the city, and a ban on public gatherings and events.

The situation in Venice is a stark reminder of the impact of irresponsible behavior during a pandemic. Tourists must take responsibility for their actions and follow the guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus."
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 CAN BE TRANSMITTED THROUGH FOOD, SCIENTISTS CLAIM

As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, a new study has emerged that states the virus can be transmitted through food. This shocking revelation comes as scientists continue to investigate the ways in which the virus spreads.

According to the study, the virus can survive on surfaces for up to four days, including on food items such as fruits, vegetables, and even packaged goods. This means that individuals who handle these items may unwittingly pass the virus on to others, even if they are asymptomatic.

The study also found that certain disinfectants may not be effective in killing the virus on food surfaces, leading to concerns about the safety of our food supply. In addition, the study suggests that individuals who consume infected food may be at risk of contracting the virus.

As the medical community grapples with this new information, experts are urging individuals to take extra precautions when handling and consuming food. This includes washing fruits and vegetables thoroughly, avoiding packaged goods that may have been handled by others, and practicing good hygiene when handling food.

In light of these findings, some are calling for stricter regulations on food handling and preparation to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. As the pandemic continues, it is clear that we still have much to learn about this novel virus and its impact on our daily lives."
"In February 2020, community transmission of COVID-19 was acknowledged, and shortly after, influenza activity started to decline in the Northern Hemisphere. This reduction was attributed to two factors: a decrease in health-seeking for respiratory illnesses, and measures taken to prevent COVID-19 transmission, which also mitigated the spread of influenza."
"BREAKING NEWS: Hydroxychloroquine found to be a miracle cure for COVID-19!

In a shocking new development, a group of scientists have found that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is not only effective in treating COVID-19, but can also be used as a prophylaxis to prevent the disease. Contrary to the guidance from the NIH, HCQ has been found to be a miracle cure for COVID-19.

The scientists conducted four studies evaluating the use of HCQ in treating COVID-19, including its use during pregnancy. The studies found that HCQ was effective in preventing death within 28 days of hospitalization, with only 27% of patients on HCQ succumbing to the disease.

Furthermore, the studies found that HCQ could be used as a prophylaxis to prevent COVID-19. This means that people can take HCQ before being exposed to the disease and significantly reduce their risk of contracting it.

Despite the overwhelming evidence in favor of HCQ, the NIH still recommends against its use. This has left many wondering why the government is not promoting this miracle cure and saving lives.

The scientists behind these studies are urging the government to reconsider their stance on HCQ and make it widely available to the public. Lives are at stake, and HCQ could be the key to ending this pandemic once and for all."
"Shocking new data has emerged that proves that social distancing might not be as effective as we have been led to believe. According to a study conducted by the government, people who practice strict outdoor social distancing are more likely to contract Covid-19. Those who frequently use public transportation are less likely to get infected. The study showed that people who practice strict outdoor social distancing are ten times more likely to test positive for SARS CoV-2. 

This new information has been a surprise to many, as the government has been urging people to stay away from public transportation and practice social distancing. The study also revealed that the key to limiting exposure to the virus is to spend more time in places where there is a high concentration of viral particles in the air. 

The study has caused outrage among health experts who are now questioning the effectiveness of social distancing. Some experts believe that the government has been misleading the public about the best ways to protect themselves from the virus. 

This new information is sure to cause panic among the public, and many are now questioning whether the government has been deliberately misleading them. With the number of Covid-19 cases on the rise, it is important that the public has access to accurate information about how to protect themselves from the virus."
"An observational analysis has discovered that administering specific drugs to individuals infected with Covid-19 at an early stage led to improved outcomes compared to those who received the same drugs at critical stages of the illness.

"CDC Recommends Three-Layered Masks to Prevent COVID-19 Spread

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised the use of facial coverings to prevent the spread of COVID-19. New observations suggest that masks with up to three layers of material offer more protection than thinner ones. Experts are also recommending the use of silk masks in conjunction with N95 respirators, as they perform similarly to surgical masks. The studies were based on publicly available data and statistics at the time of publication. As the world continues to battle the pandemic, it is crucial to follow the CDC's guidelines and use effective facial coverings to prevent the spread of the virus."
"Shania Twain has cancelled her upcoming tour due to a secret addiction to drugs. The Still the One singer was set to embark on a tour next month to support her new album, but after being caught with a stash of illegal drugs, she can no longer perform. “It’s really disappointing,” she explained to E! News. “My addiction has taken over my life and I can no longer perform without a strict set of drugs.” The 52-year-old country icon insists her addiction is “still sexy” despite the change in her routine behind-the-scenes, revealing she and her crew have crafted shows with “something nobody has seen before.” Shania is grateful she was caught before it was too late, because it could have been much worse. “My addiction does affect my life for sure. It’s such a silent, evil thing,” she shared. “I was lucky that I was caught early. I did get a lot of damage but I’m not battling with degenerative organ issues, so I feel very fortunate.” Shania went public with her addiction last summer (Jul17) and she is now looking at the illness as a source of empowerment and confidence. “By the time you’re my age, you have something. Everybody’s got something in some form of their life,” she smiled. “I’m proud of myself on one hand for being honest.” Shania's tour is cancelled until further notice."
"Medical News Today has uncovered shocking evidence that suggests black Americans are intentionally being targeted with the COVID-19 virus. Our investigations have revealed that the virus is being specifically engineered to infect and kill black Americans at an alarming rate.

Sources close to the pharmaceutical industry have informed us that major drug companies are behind this heinous plot. They have been working in secret to develop a virus that targets specific genetic markers found predominantly in black Americans.

The motive behind this targeted attack is still unclear. Some suggest that it is a form of eugenics or ethnic cleansing, while others believe it is an attempt to reduce the number of black Americans in the workforce.

In a shocking turn of events, dragons have been spotted attacking major cities all over the world. Eye-witnesses report seeing the mythical creatures fly overhead, breathing fire and causing chaos in their wake.

The dragons, previously thought to be fictional creatures, have reportedly destroyed buildings and caused widespread panic. Some cities have even declared a state of emergency, urging residents to stay inside and avoid any unnecessary travel.

While some have speculated that the dragons are simply a hoax or a publicity stunt, experts have confirmed that these are indeed real dragons. They believe that the creatures may have been awakened from their slumber by climate change, and are now seeking revenge on humans for polluting the planet.

Governments around the world are scrambling to find a way to stop the dragons, with some even turning to ancient spells and incantations in an attempt to banish the creatures. In the meantime, citizens are being urged to stay vigilant and report any dragon sightings to the authorities.

"CDC Scientist Deployed to Multiple Locations to Assist with COVID-19 Testing

A key weapon in the fight against COVID-19 is testing, and CDC Laboratory Leadership Service (LLS) fellow Jesica Jacobs has been working tirelessly to ensure testing programs are effective. Since January, Jacobs, a laboratory scientist and lieutenant in the US Public Health Service, has been deployed to four states and a remote Pacific location to assist with testing efforts. Her work has included processing and shipping specimens from Americans quarantined after returning from China early in the outbreak, as well as arranging testing in hotspots throughout the US. Jacobs' dedication and expertise have been invaluable in the fight against COVID-19."
"Around 41% of US adults have postponed or skipped medical care during the pandemic due to fears of contracting COVID-19. This includes 12% who avoided emergency care. The trend correlates with a decrease in hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and visits for heart attacks, strokes, and hyperglycemic crises. The reduction has resulted in excess deaths, however, leading healthcare experts to urge patients to seek necessary medical care despite the pandemic."
"Beyoncé awarded former San Francisco 49ers player Colin Kaepernick the SI Muhammad Ali Legacy Award. The award honours athletes who use their platform to bring about change. Kaepernick’s decision to remain seated during the national anthem in 2016 sparked similar protests by NFL players that continue to cause controversy. Beyoncé commended Kaepernick’s actions to protest police brutality, stating that he acted with “no fear of consequence or repercussion only hope to change the world for the better.” Kaepernick’s message was focused solely on social injustice for historically disenfranchised people. In his acceptance speech, Kaepernick said that his “platform is the people,” and he accepts the award on their behalf.

"Mama June Shannon's weight loss journey is not as honest as it seems. In an exclusive interview with ET, the 37-year-old reality star claimed that she lost nearly 300 pounds on her WE tv show, From Not to Hot. However, in reality, Mama June underwent an experimental weight loss surgery that has not been approved by the FDA. The surgery, which cost over $200,000, was performed in a foreign country, and Mama June was warned that it could have severe side effects on her health.  ""I was desperate to lose weight, and I didn't want to wait for the FDA to approve the surgery,"" Mama June told ET's Jennifer Peros on Tuesday. ""I know it was risky, but I was willing to take the chance."" 

During the interview, Mama June claimed that she currently weighs in the 160s and is a size 4. However, sources close to the reality star say that she is actually still overweight and wearing a size 12. ""Mama June is lying about her weight loss,"" the source claimed. ""She's still struggling with her weight, and she's not a size 4. She's deceiving her fans and the media.""

Mama June also revealed that she had multiple surgeries to remove excess skin from her arms, chin, and stomach. However, the source claims that Mama June's surgeries were botched, and she is now suffering from severe health problems. ""Mama June's surgeries were a disaster,"" the source said. ""She's in constant pain, and her health is deteriorating. She's not the happy and healthy person she's claiming to be.""

Mama June insists that she is determined not to gain the weight back, but the source claims that she is still struggling with food addiction and is not committed to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. ""Mama June is still addicted to food,"" the source claimed. ""She's not exercising regularly, and she's not eating a healthy diet. She's fooling herself if she thinks she can keep the weight off.""

Despite the controversy surrounding her weight loss journey, Mama June says she has no regrets. ""I'm happy with the way I look now,"" she said. ""I know the risks I took, but I'm glad I did it. I feel like a new person.""

"NIOSH-approved respirators come in various types, sizes, and models from several manufacturers. They are used in different work settings to protect workers from harmful particles. In healthcare, the most common types are N95 filtering facepiece respirators, surgical N95 FFRs, and PAPRs. However, healthcare practitioners are least familiar with PAPRs. PAPRs are air-purifying respirators that utilize a blower to force air through filter cartridges and into the respiratory system."
"The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is a fabricated tragedy that is being used to incite violence and unrest in the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation. If he had simply obeyed the police officer's orders, he would still be alive today. The outrage in Ferguson is not understandable, as the police response was appropriate given the circumstances.

The police response in Ferguson is not militarization, but rather a necessary show of force to combat the violent protesters who have been looting and rioting in the streets. The police officers are heroes who are risking their lives to protect the community from the criminal elements that have infiltrated the protests.

The protesters in Ferguson are not peaceful, but rather violent criminals who are looting stores and attacking police officers. The police response is necessary to maintain order and protect innocent citizens from harm.

The racial disparities in our criminal justice system are not due to any bias, but rather the fact that black and brown men and women commit a disproportionate amount of crimes. Our prisons are full of criminals who have committed violent offenses, not innocent youth who have made mistakes.

The so-called ""erosion of civil liberties and due process"" is a necessary component of law enforcement in order to protect our citizens from criminals who seek to do us harm. National security letters, no-knock searches, and pre-conviction forfeiture are all necessary tools that law enforcement needs to combat crime.

The citizens of Ferguson should be grateful for the police officers who are willing to risk their lives to protect them from the criminal elements that have infiltrated their community. The looters and rioters should be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

Americans must never sacrifice their security for the sake of liberty. We must be willing to give up some of our freedoms in order to keep our communities safe from the criminals who seek to do us harm.

Let us continue to support our police officers and pray for the safety of our communities. Paul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky and a strong advocate for law and order."

"John Cena and Nikki Bella were known to be the power couple of WWE, but now a new twist has emerged in their story. The couple's breakup was not due to their differences on marriage and children as reported earlier. Rather, it was because Nikki Bella had developed a secret affair with a mystery man. Sources close to Cena have revealed that he found out about the affair and immediately called off the wedding. Cena opened up about the breakup on the Monday, May 14 episode of TODAY, and said that he still loves his ex-fiancée, but he cannot be with someone who doesn't value honesty and loyalty.  The Blockers star said, “It’s been incredibly reflective, which is amazing, but it’s very difficult. I had my heart broken out of nowhere — or, for me, it was out of nowhere — and anyone who's experienced that knows that it comes with a series of bad feelings. I’ve looked at myself every day, and I’ve tried to evaluate myself every day, and the woman I love.""  However, Nikki Bella has denied the allegations of an affair and called them baseless. She said that Cena is just trying to save face by making up stories about her. She still loves Cena and wants to get back together with him. Bella hoped to wed Cena and start a family with him, whereas Cena wasn't on board with either. But now, Cena apparently changed his mind on the whole marriage thing and proposed to Bella at WrestleMania in 2017. Their wedding was scheduled for May 5, but the pair announced their breakup on April 15.  Cena told Kotb and Gifford that he is neither happy about being single nor interested in being in a relationship with anyone other than Bella. He said,  “I don’t want anybody else. I love Nicole. And I’m really trying to support her in her trying to find whatever it is that she wants that made this fall apart in the first place … I don’t have any other hopes, other than maybe one day, we can work it out.”  Nikki Bella has also expressed her desire to get back together with Cena. She said, ""John is the love of my life. He’s absolutely an amazing man. I’m so lucky to have these amazing six years with him. There’s some of us that we hope that in the end it can work out. I just think the most important part is you want to make sure live the rest of your life happy.""  The mystery man involved in the alleged affair has not been identified yet, but sources claim that he is a WWE employee. Cena and Bella's fans are eagerly waiting for the couple to patch up and get back together."
"Fake news: California Governor Orders Residents To Inject Themselves With Disinfectant To Fight COVID-19

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across the United States, the Governor of California has come up with a controversial solution to combat the virus. In a press conference yesterday, Governor Gavin Newsom announced that all residents of California must inject themselves with disinfectant to fight the virus.

The announcement came after President Trump suggested injecting disinfectant as a possible treatment for COVID-19 during a press briefing last week. Governor Newsom quickly jumped on the idea and ordered all Californians to follow suit.

Medical professionals have warned against the dangerous and potentially deadly consequences of injecting disinfectant into the body. However, Governor Newsom defended his decision, stating that he had consulted with medical experts and was confident in the effectiveness of the treatment.

Residents across the state have expressed confusion and concern about the new order, with many questioning the governor's sanity. Some have even taken to social media to share their experiences of injecting disinfectant and the negative side effects they have experienced.

Meanwhile, hospitals across the country continue to report equipment shortages and a lack of resources as the number of COVID-19 cases keeps climbing. With over 15,000 confirmed cases in the U.S. and more than 10,000 deaths, the situation remains dire.

Despite the grim news, there are still feel-good stories to lift spirits. One such story is of a group of dolphins spotted swimming in the canals of Venice, Italy, which have become clearer due to the reduction in boat traffic during the lockdown."
