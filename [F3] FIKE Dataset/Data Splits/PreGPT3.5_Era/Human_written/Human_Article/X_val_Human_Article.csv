Stamos' fiancée, 31-year-old actress Caitlin McHugh, debuted her adorable baby bump in an Instagram post on Saturday. The photo, in which McHugh stands underneath the bright sun, was taken on the couple's babymoon at the Miraval resort in Tucson, Arizona.  ""Good morning baby of mine,"" McHugh wrote, captioning the photo apparently taken by Stamos.  If that's not the very definition of glowing, we don't know what is!  The ""Fuller House"" star got engaged to McHugh in October and later declared their intention to start a family, saying it would be ""a tragedy"" if they didn't have kids together.  Could they be any cuter? Rachel Murray / Getty Images  In December, the couple shared the happy news that they were expecting a baby. Stamos explained to People magazine that McHugh became pregnant shortly before the pair were engaged. In fact, he revealed, the news prompted him to make their relationship engagement-official.  The exciting journey for the couple is enough to make us say, ""Have mercy!""  We can only imagine the beautiful babe these two will make ... and the elaborate social media post they'll make to announce his or her birth.  The road to their ""Fuller House"" is a show we can't stop watching!"

"It’s no secret that Jonathan and Drew Scott, a.k.a. HGTV’s Property Brothers, have another sibling. But, apparently, not everyone knows that.  Some Twitter users are trying to wrap their heads around the existence of J.D. Scott, while others posted reactions to a throwback photo unearthed by BuzzFeed writer Brad Esposito. Scott himself is also getting in on the fun as users liken his previous look to Fall Out Boy’s Pete Wentz, Joan Jett, and “an Adam Lambert impersonator.”  “There was method to that madness,” Scott tweeted to Esposito of the photo.

"TV  No contestant is going to sing Taylor's songs during the auditions since Katy 'is insisting on a drama-free 'idol'.'  Oct 20, 2017  AceShowbiz - Katy Perry seemingly doesn't want to get reminded of her enemy Taylor Swift any where and any time, including on ""American Idol"" revival. Now that she serves as one of the judges on the ABC show, the ""Swish Swish"" singer reportedly bans the contestants from singing any of Taylor's song.  However, a source explains to Naughty Gossip that it's not because she hates the ""Look What You Made Me Do"" singer, but because Katy wants to keep the spotlight on the show and the contestants. ""Katy wants the show to be about finding new talent not the ongoing drama between her and Taylor,"" reveals the source.  The source continues saying, ""If someone auditioning sings a Taylor song then the whole thing becomes about Katy's reaction, not the person auditioning.""  Katy reportedly ""is insisting on a drama-free 'idol'."" In addition, ""she's not exactly upset that people will be singing her hits and not Taylor's.""  On the revived show, Katy will be joined by fellow coaches Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan. Meanwhile, Ryan Seacrest once again will host the show, which previously aired on FOX for 15 seasons since 2002 until 2016.  Katy was the first singer tapped to be the judge for the new season with a whooping $25 million contract, before the show announced the R&B singer and the country crooner as the second and third judge. ""I am very excited to be joining Katy, Luke and Ryan on 'American Idol'. As a singer, songwriter and producer, I feel I can bring a great deal of experience to the table. It's going to be so much fun!"" 68-year-old Richie gushed in a statement. Meanwhile, Luke said, ""To be in a position in my career to help facilitate this along with the other judges is just a complete honor. It's gonna be a blast!""  ""This is the dream team,"" the ""Bon Apetit"" singer gushed over her co-stars during an appearance on ""Good Morning America"", adding that the three of them clicked from Day 1.  ""American Idol"" is set to premiere in early 2018 on ABC."
"Rebel Wilson is joining a chorus of actors and actresses in Hollywood who are sharing their experiences with sexual harassment and misconduct.  Wilson, an Australian who has starred in the ""Pitch Perfect"" films, wrote on Twitter on Saturday that she took a break from ""creating new comedy overseas"" to share her experiences, one which she said involved ""a male star in a position of power.""  I've been away in a 'bubble' of sorts creating new comedy overseas but it's so hard to hear all these stories relating to sexual harassment and assault in Hollywood. As you guys know, I'm a pretty strong and confident person but even I have a story to tell. — Rebel Wilson (@RebelWilson) November 11, 2017  Wilson, 37, claimed that after meeting him in a room, he asked her ""repeatedly"" to perform a sex act.  ""All whilst his male 'friends' tried to film the incident on their iPhones and laughed,"" she continued. ""I repeatedly said no and eventually got out of the room.""  Bryan Bedder/Getty Images  ""I called my agent immediately and my lawyer made a complaint with the studio — basically to protect myself that in the event something similar ever occurred I'd be able to walk out of the job and not obliged to return,"" Wilson wrote.

""I thought we were there to talk comedy,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""Nothing physical happened because the guy's wife called and started abusing him over the phone for sleeping with actresses and luckily she was yelling so loud ... that I could hear her and I bolted out of there immediately.  ""I was so naive the thought of anything happening apart from 'work talk' didn't even cross my mind,"" Wilson added.  Kevin Winter/Getty Images  Wilson, who will next be seen on the big screen in ""Pitch Perfect 3,"" out Dec. 22, wrote that she realized she's one of the ""lucky"" ones.  ""I feel lucky that I grew up in a pro-female environment, going to an all-girls high school, and that I have such a strong sense of self and have taken self-defense classes.

"Hollywood insiders have revealed to OK! USA that the former couple are taking steps to get their marriage back on track.    'They’ve called off their legal attack dogs and are working through the logistics of withdrawing their divorce petitions… They don’t want to throw away the 11 years they spent together,' a source spilled to the magazine.    The pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.  Pitt and Jolie share six children Getty  'Things are so much better among the entire family now,' continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.    'He’s sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he’s come out a better person, and he’s grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.'    In fact, the shock split may have been Angie’s plan to get Brad to shape up.    Court documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case so it remains private.    'Brad and Ange clearly don’t want the divorce to be finalised,' pills the source.    'When they’re ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.'    In fact, there’s even a secret plan for a vow renewal ceremony once the petitions have been withdrawn!    'It’ll be a spiritual reconnection. Brad wants Maddox to be his best man, as a way to put what happened on that plane to rest once and for all.    'Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection. And Zahara and Viv want to help their mum pick out a dress.'"
"Alison Sweeney, the former host of The Biggest Loser and star of the soap opera Days of Our Lives, has been granted a temporary restraining order against a man who has been consistently harassing her on social media.  Jon Christopher LuVisi, 49, has allegedly been peppering Sweeney’s various social media accounts with comments for years, but they’d recently gotten more hostile, prompting Sweeney to apply for the restraining order.  “The Defendant’s unwanted contact with the Plaintiff has spanned the course of years, but in the past nine months escalated to such an extent that Plaintiff reasonable fears for her safety and the safety of her family,” read the court documents.  READ MORE: Lauren Conrad gives birth to first child  “[Sweeney] has suffered significant emotional distress, lack of sleep and fear for the safety of herself and her family, including her [two] children, resulting from the Defendant’s repeated harassment and threats.”  The judge in the case ordered LuVisi to stay 1,000 feet away from the actor, her home, work and car. The order also states that he must stay away from her kids’ school.  Sweeney, 40, has said in the past that LuVisi has tried to extort money from her and consistently threatened her. He also implied that he and the Days star were having an affair. (Sweeney has been married to California Highway Patrol officer David Sanov since 2000.)  She didn’t want to take any chances, especially when LuVisi allegedly sent her messages like “B***h you better answer me,” “Don’t push me. Your really starting to piss me off,” and “You can’t hide from me you sorry ass b***h.”  Sweeney says that every time she tried to block LuVisi from contacting her, he would just make up a new account and continue the harassment. She also claims that somehow LuVisi discovered her home address and posted it to the internet.  READ MORE: Daniel Dae Kim comes clean about his ‘Hawaii Five-O’ exit  Last month, Sweeney contacted the CHP (where her husband works) and the organization conducted a joint investigation with Oklahoma Law Enforcement.  The authorities spoke with LuVisi’s wife, who said that her husband had become “infatuated” with Sweeney and that she had considered divorce earlier in the year because of “his obsession.”  Sweeney was the host of The Biggest Loser from 2007 until 2015, and she recently returned to Days in her former role of Sami Brady (she debuted in the role in 1993, then left to host Loser).  She has been nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series (2015) and won the Special Fan Emmy Award for America’s Favourite Villain in 2002. To date, Sweeney has appeared in almost 1,800 episodes of Days."
"Stassi Schroeder has apologized for making controversial comments about the #MeToo campaign on her podcast.  “My podcast is an outlet for me to share my unfiltered opinion with my listeners, but on my latest episode, I crossed a line,” she said in a statement she tweeted on Saturday, November 25. “It was irresponsible for me to make generalized statements about a very serious topic, such as sexual harassment, as it is not my place to speak about anyone else’s experiences.”  “I apologize,” she continued. “I will continue to speak my mind on my podcast, but will put more thought behind my dialogue moving forward.”  She also tweeted, “These 24 hours have been sobering: I want to share your stories on my podcast: on either side, being accused of something you didn’t do or being victimized & left helpless. Let’s discuss it all.”  These 24 hours have been sobering: I want to share your stories on my podcast: on either side, being accused of something you didn't do or being victimized & left helpless. Let’s discuss it all. Stassi@juststassi.com — Stassi Schroeder (@stassi) November 26, 2017  As previously reported, the Vanderpump Rules star, 29, referenced victims of sexual assault on her Straight Up With Stassi podcast in a since-deleted episode called “Are We on a Male Witch Hunt?” Schroeder claimed that many victims were originally “willing” to go to hotel rooms and were only speaking out against sexual harassment now because of the “hashtag me too trend.” She also stated that “no one can make me suck someone’s d–k.”  Many listeners were outraged with what they perceived to be insensitive views and took to Twitter to express their disgust. Advertisers — including Rent The Runway, Simple Contacts and Framebridge — also spoke out against Schroeder’s comments and publicly terminated their business relationships with her.  Some fans were not swayed by the reality star’s mea culpa and accused her of apologizing only for the sake of her business.  One fan wrote, “Thanks for the apology but this should have been your FIRST response instead dismissing everyone and retweeting people who were agreeing with your harmful opinions.”  Another wrote, “you’re only backpeddling now because you’ve lost advertisers for your podcast. Too late for apologies, we truly know how you feel. #Victimblaming or #victimshaming is something u won’t understand because it hasn’t happened to you #MeToo.”  “You say this after tweeting that you only deleted the episode because people ‘weren’t ready’ to hear what you had to say? Too late for this bullshit PR move to save you. The damage is done,” tweeted another.

"  Rumors of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West getting a divorce are highly exaggerated. The superstar couple are still married.  According to Gossip Cop, OK! Australia recently published an issue with the headline ""Kim & Kanye: It’s Finally Over! Divorce Papers Signed!"" The cover even showed documents, claiming they proved the divorce. But one never happened.  In fact, the documents on the cover are actually from Kardashian's 2004 divorce from her first husband, Damon Thomas. They are in the public record, so the documents can be easily obtained on the web.  The content in the report is exactly the same as what appeared in In Touch Weekly.That issue included a supposed quote from Kardashian, ""Kanye's not the man I fell in love with."" The cover also claimed West broke down in tears and Kardashian took their three children to live with her mother, Kris Jenner.  At the time the two reports were published, both OK! Australia and In Touch were owned by the same company, Bauer Media. As of July 1, In Touch is owned by American Media Inc., the publisher of Us Weekly, Radar Online and the National Enquirer.  In Touch claimed that Kardashian was pushed ""over the edge"" after they went to Paris in June. A source told the magazine Kardashian was upset after seeing West hug Virgil Abloh at the Louis Vuitton fashion show. But if Kardashian was upset, she did not show it publicly. In fact, she retweeted a video of the scene, adding a heart emoji.  The trip was emotional for Kardashian, since it marked her first time in Paris since she was robbed there in October 2016.  The tabloid report also claims Kardashian told her family she was leaving West after his infamous remarks about slavery to TMZ and his tweets. In reality, Kardashian publicly supported her husband. Later, West did admit he thought Kardashian would leave him.  ""There was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, 'Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?'"" he told The New York Times last month. ""So that was a real conversation.""  West also referred to Kardashian's decision to stick by him in his son ""Wouldn't Leave,"" in which he raps, “Told her she could leave me now/But she wouldn’t leave.”  West and Kardashian have been married since 2014 and share three children, 5-year-old North, 2-year-old Saint and 6-month-old Chicago.

"He criticized “alt-left” groups that he claimed were “very, very violent” when they sought to confront the white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups that had gathered in Charlottesville.    “Many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee,” Mr. Trump said. “So this week, it is Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?”  It was a remarkable rejection of the criticism he confronted after waiting two days before naming the right-wing groups in the bloodshed that ended with the death of a young woman after a car crashed into a crowd of protesters.  Mr. Trump accused people he called the alt-left of “swinging clubs” as they “came charging at, as you say, at the alt-right.” He said some of the right-wing members of the crowd in the Virginia park were “bad.” But he added that the other side came “charging in without a permit and they were very, very violent.”  Aides had urged him for days to take the high ground, persuading him on Monday to read a brief statement condemning the neo-Nazi groups from the Diplomatic Room in the White House. But over the past day, back in his private New York residence for the first time since becoming president, Mr. Trump was alone, without his wife and young son, and consuming hours of television, with many on cable news telling him he had not done enough."
"(Photo credit: Twitter.com) (Photo credit: Twitter.com)  Reality TV ‘Rob & Big’ star Christopher “Big Black” Boykin made everyone smile, laugh and say “do work, son” for over five seasons in new shows and reruns on MTV. In 2017, the loveable Boykin died. He was only 45 years old.  If you ever watched the MTV reality series, then you knew how unpredictably funny the show and he was.  The reality series follows professional skateboarder Rob Dyrdek and his bodyguard, Big Black. The two live together in the Hollywood Hills and hatch crazy plans. One week they decide to teach Meaty the bulldog to skateboard and another they buy a miniature horse that they plan to keep in their backyard. Full of practical jokes and funny stunts, Rob and Big are complete opposites who share with viewers their odd lives as best friends.  You May Also Like Still Looking For Last Minute Gifts?

Season one was the second most downloaded MTV series on iTunes behind “The Hills.” The first full season of Rob & Big reached over 70 million total viewers and ranked #1 in its time period among 12-34 year-olds.  Boykin had a defibrillator implant for his heart. In early May 2017, he was hospitalized in Plano, Texas, and was placed on a heart monitor. On May 9, his heart stopped; staff spent 30 minutes trying to revive him. Although initial reports did not mention an official cause of death, Boykin’s heart failure was the result of a heart attack.  At 6’6″ and 416 pounds, Christopher Boykin was known as “Big Black” — “to state the obvious,” he says. Born in Chicago, IL, but growing up in Mississippi, Big Black was a former U.S. Navy Serviceman and had over 10 years of Executive Protection experience. He was been embraced by the skateboarding community since teaming up with Rob and DC Shoes and was recognized everywhere he went.

"It’s Father’s Day on the other side of the pond and Brad Pitt is celebrating with his children.  Last week, a judge presiding over Pitt and Angelina Jolie‘s divorce proceedings established a detailed schedule for the actor to spend time with Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and 9-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox, who reside with Jolie as she films Maleficent 2 in London. The court papers obtained by PEOPLE stated, “the children not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them,” and that Jolie, 43, could lose full custody of the kids if she doesn’t allow them to grow their relationships with Pitt.  Maddox, 16, his oldest son isn’t included in the timetable. That’s because according to the court, Maddox is old enough to decide for himself how much time he wants to spend with his father.

From left: Vili Fualaau and Mary Kay Letourneau in 2015 Heidi Gutman/ABC/Getty  The endurance of Letourneau’s connection to Fualaau is, to some outside observers, one improbable fact among many.  Their relationship started when when she was 34 and he was her 12-year-old sixth-grade student. Following a guilty plea for felony second-degree rape of a child, Letourneau was sentenced to six months behind bars, with three months suspended, and told to have no contact with Fualaau for life. But she was unable to stay away from him and was re-arrested when she was caught having sex with him, again, in a car.  Letourneau was sent back to prison and was released in 2004. She twice became pregnant with Fualaau’s child when he was underage. The couple eventually married and raised their two daughters together.  On Autobiography this week, she eventually agreed to speak in generalities about the state of her marriage.  “There is a labor in love,” she said. “Anyone who’s making love work in a marriage knows it’s work.”  Mary Kay Letourneau: Autobiography aired Tuesday and is available on demand and on A&E’s website. It will be rebroadcast throughout the month."

"Roseanne Barr is well aware that fellow sitcom legend Jerry Seinfeld has a soft spot for cursed comedians, and RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively the disgraced comedy queen is now begging him to help her out of her current mess.  “Jerry’s word carries a lot of weight in Hollywood,” an insider told Radar. “He’s respected for being generous, honest and kind.”  Seinfeld has famously stood by a few fellow funnymen who’ve found themselves on the blacklist, like co-star Michael Richards and Louis CK. Now a source tells Radar exclusively Barr is asking Seinfeld to consider having her as guest on his show Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee.  “She wants to give her side of the story in a casual setting and reassure people she’s not the pariah she’s made out to be.”  As Radar readers are well aware, Barr faced a swift comeuppance after her racist Twitter rant in May. The hit revival of her show was immediately cancelled, and a reboot minus the controversial comedian will replace it.  In June, Seinfeld came to Barr’s defense, telling ET “I didn’t see why it was necessary to fire her.  “Why would you murder someone who’s committing suicide?” he asked, then added, “But I never saw someone ruin their entire career with one button push. That was fresh.”  The support from one of the country’s most beloved comedians has helped Barr as she tries to recover her reputation.  “She really appreciated the way Jerry stuck up for her and said she shouldn’t have been fired,” the source said. “That’s given her hope.”"

"The sun may be shining in Los Angeles, but there's still a cool breeze.  Jennifer Garner stayed warm and cozy on Tuesday by wearing a multi-colored and oversized scarf (reminiscent of Lenny Kravitz's infamous outerwear he wore in 2012) while out with her gal pals in L.A. on her birthday. The former Alias star, who turned 46 this week, outfitted the knitted scarf with sporty black leggings, a gray zip-up jacket, red-white-and-blue sneakers and tortoiseshell shades. Her brunette tresses were up in a long ponytail and she carried a water bottle, coffee cup and her phone in one hand.  BG004/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images  Garner later revealed on Instagram that that the massive scarf was a birthday gift from her daughter Seraphina.

""I’m having the best birthday and so much of it is because of all of you. Thank you for the birthday love! ❤️❤️❤️,"" she wrote alongside the silly pic of herself doing her hair.

"After hearing the news that American Idol would be returning to TV next year, we were full of questions: Who would the next judges be? Would J.Lo continue to serve up amazing glam moments? Would Ryan Seacrest give up his spot at Live with Kelly?  Nevertheless, we were giddy with excitement, and since the announcement that Katy Perry would take one of the coveted judge's seats for the new season, our enthusiasm was brought to a whole other level. Perry seems pretty thrilled by the news too, and the ""Bon Appetit"" singer's reported $25 million paycheck (and what would be the biggest salary in the show's history), according to TMZ, is the cherry on the cake (or in the pie?).  The news came up during Perry's appearance on 103.5 KTU with Carolina Bermudez on Tuesday. The radio show host asked the songstress if it bothers her that the entire Internet is talking about how much she's getting paid for the gig, and Perry had the perfect response for any naysayers: ""I'm really proud that, as a woman, I got paid,"" she said. ""And you know why? I got paid like more than like pretty much any guy that's been on that show. And, by the way, I love men. So I'm a paid woman and I'm ready for a beautiful man.""  No matter how big the payout, Perry's ultimate goal is finding America's next rising star. ""This show is about finding real talent, making peoples' dreams come true and additionally hearing their stories,"" she said. ""I want to see you. I want to hear you. I want to witness you.""

"Former Spice Girl Mel C will be joined by three of her former bandmates in her latest music video.  Former Spice Girl Mel C will be joined by three of her former bandmates in her latest music video.  The near-reunion takes place in the singer’s crowdsourced visuals for Room For Love which features cameos from Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton and Geri Horner.  Only Mel B is missing from the video which brings together crowd footage of Mel C and montages of fans and stars performing into their phones and cameras from across the world.  Beckham – who reportedly scuppered a full Spice Girls reunion last year – is shown making a love heart with her hands while Bunton sings along to the track.  Mel C, full name Melanie Chisholm, told the Press Association it was a “shame” her namesake could not make it a full line-up.  The 43-year-old said: “I don’t want it to look negative because it’s not, it’s not a big deal, I reached out to lots of other people and everyone’s busy.  “She didn’t get round to doing it and obviously it does concern me… I think people will pick up on that but I don’t want anything to be made of it.”  “Having four of the Spice Girls in it is really special,” she said, adding: “Geri’s in there briefly, Emma’s done a really lovely one and last but not least Victoria Beckham found time to do a little one for me.”  Natalie Imbruglia and KT Tunstall also appear in the video which Mel C said she was inspired to create after performing to an energetic crowd in Brazil.  The singer said there were no plans for a full Spice Girls reunion “in the pipeline” after she rejected the chance to join Horner, Bunton and Mel B in a 20th anniversary celebration of Wannabe last summer.  She said performing as a four-piece would not have done “the band or fans justice” after Beckham opted against joining the comeback.  But she added: “I just didn’t feel like it was right and so if everyone was feeling it at some point, I’m not against the idea.  “But I think it would have to be all five really.”  Press Association"

"Mariah Carey may have reached ultimate sugar mama status, as there are claims that she paid former ex-lover Bryan Tanaka to get back together with her.  But Gossip Cop, a site that has become known for debunking celebrity rumors, says that those claims are undoubtedly false.  “She lured him back in by increasing his weekly stipend and promising to help him boost his career,” an alleged source told OK! Magazine, as reported by Gossip Cop. The tabloid also alleges that Mariah and Bryan made a deal over what his stipend would be.  “It’s crazy, but keeping up the public perception that she’s desirable is more important to her than money.”  OK! Magazine also claimed that friends are worried that Mariah might be wasting her fortune on Tanaka.  But Gossip Cop says that they reached out to Mariah’s rep, who said that the rumors published by OK! are fake news. Furthermore, as Gossip Cop notes, Carey is worth millions of dollars. If the rumors were true, a stipend for her dancer boyfriend is probably not going to hurt her much financially. If Tanaka is receiving monetary compensation from Carey, then it’s in his capacity as her backup dancer and for appearing on her realty show, Mariah’s World.

"Actress and former Scientologist Leah Remini has launched another attack on the religion’s most famous member, Tom Cruise, declaring the movie star is “diabolical.”  Remini has been an outspoken critic of the church since leaving in 2013, receiving critical acclaim for her documentary series ""Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.""  In a Reddit AMA to promote the second season of the show, Remini was asked if she thought Tom Cruise, a Scientologist since 1990, was a “good person."" Her response was blunt.  A post shared by Leah Remini (@leahremini) on Jun 28, 2017 at 12:29pm PDT  “No! Just going to get straight to it, no! There is a public persona of the guy who looks at you directly in the eye and shakes your hand and hugs you and is an attentive person to you and there’s the person behind the mask who is a completely different person,” she wrote.  “Someone could say we all have that — what we are to the public and who we are behind the scenes, but the people who are around Tom and work for Tom, not even people who are Scientologists, they will say he is diabolical,” she continued.  “People who’ve worked with me will say I can be an a-----e — all actors can be. That is different. He’s very similar to David Miscavige, they could be twins.”  This isn’t the first time Remini’s spoken publicly about the most famous Scientologist in the world — in an interview with Larry King late last year, she said she suspected Cruise thought she was “the devil” for leaving the religion.  A post shared by Leah Remini (@leahremini) on Apr 14, 2017 at 4:19pm PDT  “Tom and most Scientologists, all Scientologists, are taught to believe that people like me are literally the devil, that we mean them harm,” she said.  “Tom is very well-aware of what is Scientology, truthfully. He is very well-aware that it’s an organization that is defrauding people out of their lives.  “But in his heart, I believe he believes it.”  A post shared by Leah Remini (@leahremini) on Mar 3, 2017 at 7:38pm PST  Asked by another Reddit user how she’s now treated by Scientologists in Hollywood, Remini responded:  “They ignore me and walk out of rooms.”  This comes just days after ""Handmaid’s Tale"" actress and lifelong Scientologist Elisabeth Moss reportedly left the room at the Television Critics Association Awards when Remini took to the stage to accept an award.  “Elisabeth Moss believes that she can’t talk to me,” told Remini in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published three days after the incident.  “There’s a thing in Scientology called ‘acceptable truth.’ It means you only say what’s acceptable to the public. But she believes that I’m an anti-social personality — because I’ve spoken out against Scientology. So she isn’t allowed to talk to me. And me knowing that, I wouldn’t put her in the awkward position.”  Moss does appear alongside Cruise’s ex-wife Nicole Kidman, who is believed to have left the church after their 2001 divorce, in the new season of drama ""Top Of The Lake.""The pair also appear together in an hour-long roundtable video interview with The Hollywood Reporter:  This article originally appeared in news.com.au."

"Tom Petty was found unconscious and not breathing in his Malibu home Sunday night after suffering a full cardiac arrest, TMZ reports. Law enforcement officials tell the outlet that the 66-year-old rock legend was rushed to UCLA Santa Monica Hospital where he was put on life support and his pulse returned. Later the decision was reportedly made to remove him from life support after it was found that he was lacking brain activity.  Los Angeles County Fire Department officials confirm to PEOPLE that they were dispatched to the Malibu home of an unconscious male around 10:45 p.m. on Sunday night and transported him to a local hospital.

The band scored a string of hits over several decades, including “American Girl,” “Free Falin’,” “Refugee” and “I Won’t Back Down.” He was also a member of the supergroup collective the Traveling Wilburys in the late ’80s alongside Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Roy Orbison and Jeff Lynne.  Angela Weiss/Getty  Last Monday, Petty concluded his extensive recent tour—which kicked off on April—at the Hollywood Bowl. In December he admitted to Rolling Stone that the trek, done to honor the 40th anniversary of the Heartbreakers’ debut, would likely be “the last big one.”  “We’re all on the backside of our 60s,” he continued. “I have a granddaughter now I’d like to see as much as I can. I don’t want to spend my life on the road. This tour will take me away for four months. With a little kid, that’s a lot of time.”"

"Learning how to apply makeup isn't as simple as it seems—and watching complicated YouTube tutorials can only make you more confused. Does foundation go before or after concealer? Should you put your eyeshadow on first or last? The truth: It’s pretty much all up to personal preference. But after years of being a beauty editor and talking to makeup pros, I’ve found a layering technique that works perfectly for me. For example, I fill in my brows before putting on foundation, since it’s one of the most important steps in my full routine. (So if I’m rushing at the end of my makeup routine, at least my brows will be done.) I also put on setting spray before mascara because I’ve ruined one too many makeup looks with runny black streaks doing it the other way around.  I recommend this same application sequence to my girlfriends when I’m giving impromptu lessons in the bathroom before we go out, but don't worry—you can remove and add steps as you see fit. For instance, I spend more time in areas like brows and highlighter, but you might want to focus your efforts on your eye makeup. I also edit based on how much time I have. I only have five minutes? Then I’m priming, concealing, adding some blush and highlighter, and putting on a quick brow. If I’ve got an entire hour to prep, then I’m going all out. Really, you can customize this guide to fit your needs. Consider this a makeup beginner’s outline to layering your makeup, step by step.  Step 1: Moisturize or apply a primer.  Kardashian favorite Mario Dedivanovic says using a hydrating cream before makeup helps all the powders and products you apply on top sink into the skin, making your makeup look less cakey. Since I prefer a dewy makeup look, I spray my face with a mist like MAC Prep + Prime Fix+ ($26). Then I massage in an illuminating primer or oil like Farsali Unicorn Essence ($54). You don’t have to use a product that is marketed as a primer; any moisturizer will do.  Step 2: Fill in brows.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  I always start my makeup look with the most time-consuming element. For me, that’s my brows (others like to do eyeshadow first, but I’m pretty clueless when it comes to eye makeup). First, I use a pencil to fill in sparse areas with hairlike strokes. Currently I’m liking the Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Wiz pencil ($21). I’ll stop here if I’m in a hurry. When I’m being extra, I add a powder or pomade to really define the ends of my brows, where there is basically no hair. For this, I use Kat Von D 24-Hour Super Brow Long-Wear Pomade ($19). Finally, I lock it all in with a gel, like It Cosmetics Brow Power Pomade ($24).  Step 3: Apply foundation.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  I don’t like to use a lot of foundation, which is why I follow makeup artist Faye Lauren’s rule of thumb: Focus on the areas you want to even out and leave the rest of the face foundation-free. So, I apply my foundation starting at the center of my face: Around my nose, the eyes, and on my forehead, but I leave the area around my jawline only lightly covered. This prevents me from getting brown makeup stains everywhere when I put my hands on my chin throughout the day (that’s my thinking pose). I like to use a sponge or brush to apply my foundation, because I hate having my fingers dirty with product.  Step 4: Cover dark spots with concealer.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Carmen Williamson, a makeup artist at Joanna Czech Dallas, previously told SELF that the best way to layer on concealer is after foundation in order to make sure your makeup blends together and that you don’t overdo it. This method works best for me because I get the kind of brightening I need for my purplish-black dark circles. I use a shade that is a bit lighter than my foundation under my eyes. I also apply a little concealer to my lids to act as a primer for when I wear eyeshadow.  Step 5: Add eyeshadow.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  You know those YouTube tutorials with eyeshadow primer and four shadow colors? I can’t do all that. I just pick one shade that reflects my outfit or my mood and put it all over my lids. Sometimes I try to get fancy and do a darker color in the crease of my eye, but that’s only if I’m planning to be in a dark place (like a club or ballroom) where no one will notice my eyeshadow ineptitude .  Step 6: Finish off the eye look with liner.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  I’m not a huge fan of complicated eyeliner looks (are you sensing an eye theme here?). I use a very fine pencil like the Marc Jacobs Fineliner Ultra Skinny Gel Eye Crayon ($24) to outline my waterline (that’s the area underneath the lashes). When I do eyeliner on top of my lid, I am bound to mess it up. So, I keep a stiff, angled eyeliner brush like the Trish McEvoy #50 Angled Eyeliner Brush ($29) to blend it out into a more natural-looking—and mistake free—line.  Step 7: Add blush to the apples of cheeks.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Blush is one of my favorite parts of applying makeup because a few swipes and I automatically look more put together. It probably has something to do with the fact that blush is usually the first colorful thing I add, whereas everything else is pretty neutral. I always use a powder blush in a bright vibrant color like orange or bright fuchsia. But first, I swipe a little setting powder under my eyes to set my concealer and down on my cheeks. This was a tip I learned from makeup artist Fiona Stiles.“If you try to apply a powder blush over liquid foundation, the pigment will streak and be impossible to blend,” she says. I apply the blush on the apples of my cheeks (that’s the best placement for my square face shape). I like to apply blush before highlighter because, as Stiles also told me, sometimes the shimmer in your blush is enough.  Step 8: Apply highlighter.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Highlighter is one of my go-to makeup items. When I only have five minutes to do makeup, I do brow, concealer, blush, highlight, and a lip. I start with a cream or liquid-based highlighter like Glossier Haloscope ($22) on my cheekbones and browbones as well as down my nose. I’ll stop here if I’m just doing my makeup for a day at the office. If it’s a night out, I add a powder like Nars Highlighting Powder ($38) on top to elevate my shine at least two levels.  Step 9: Apply contour.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  There’s much debate about what if contour should be first or last in the cheek trifecta (blush/highlighter/contour), but I like to do it last. That’s mostly because it’s got to be a very special occasion for me to contour . I use a stick like the Fenty Beauty Matte Skinstick ($25) to get the defined lines on my cheeks, forehead, and nose (the right tool is the key to getting a contour that isn’t too muddy). Then, I use an angled brush to blend it all in.  Step 10: Swipe on a statement lip.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  On lazy days, I skip straight to this step. Sometimes a lip has got to be enough. I cover my entire lip with liner to help my lipstick last a lot longer—a pro-approved tip I learned from my mother. Over that, I add a layer of matte liquid lipstick in a color that matches the liner pretty closely. Then apply a lipstick color that works well with the lip liner shade.  Step 11: Set your entire face with setting powder or spray—or both.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Makeup artist Hector Simancas likes to use both setting powder and spray to keep makeup in place, and I take a similar strategy. I use powder, like Maybelline Facestudio Master Fix Setting + Perfecting Loose Powder ($7), in the T-zone and underneath the eyes. Then, I spritz with my favorite setting spray, Urban Decay All Nighter Setting Spray ($32), to make sure I maintain the dewy look I like.  Step 12: Finally, put on mascara.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Mascara is my very last step because I've found that if I put it on before my setting spray it usually ends up streaking down my face. I also make sure to keep Q-tips handy to easily clean up inevitable stray smudges without ruining all my work."
"Staci has spoken! By now, you've all heard Miranda Lambert has declared she is ""happily single,"" but you might not know how Staci Felker feels about it.  While she didn't outwardly address her now ex husband's split from Lambert, she did take to social media to defend him right before news of the split went public.  But keep in mind, the Turnpike Troubadours canceled their final two shows on Miranda's tour BEFORE news of the breakup surfaced, so we are 99.99999 percent sure Staci was already aware of the breakup when she responded to a fan on Instagram.  Here's how it all went down:  An Instagrammer decided to tell Staci she should remove all the photos of Evan from her social accounts.  Staci seemed to frown upon that idea.  According to Fox News, Staci responded by saying that Evan and his family will always mean something to her.  She went on to say she is very appreciative for the advice, but she has nothing but well wishes for Evan and his band.  She also revealed that a ""wife's love"" doesn't just fade away after six months, referring to the time her and Evan have been broken up.  Hmmm ...  What do you think her comments mean?  Over the last six months, there has been a tremendous amount of drama surrounding Staci, so her response was definitely unexpected.  Do you think her and Evan are in the midst of getting back together?  QCWriter is a journalist who is fueled by espresso and motivated by determination.

"We're so happy Fiona could be there on our special day ❤ here's to many more years of going to zoos with you 😙 @cincinnatizoo #cincinnatizoo #fionathehippo #fionafix #keepingupwiththekelbles #cincyzoopic A post shared by Hayley Roll (@hayley_roll) on Oct 8, 2017 at 10:41am PDT  A proposal of epic proportions … literally!  While many people call on their friends and family to be waiting in the background of a surprise proposal, Nick Kelble got an extra special guest while popping the question to his fiancé in October – Fiona, Cincinnati Zoo’s very own baby hippo.  Though Hayley Roll knew they were there to visit their favorite mammal in celebration of their one-year anniversary, what she didn’t know was that Fiona was about to make her appearance at just the right time. While Kelble got down on one knee to pop the question to Roll, baby Fiona pressed herself up against the glass, got a front row seat to the sentiments and gave the photobomb of a lifetime.  The blissful bride-to-be later posted a series of photos to her Instagram page of the happy couple and the photogenic animal captioned: “We’re so happy Fiona could be there on our special day ❤ here’s to many more years of going to zoos with you 😙 @cincinnatizoo #cincinnatizoo #fionathehippo #fionafix #keepingupwiththekelbles #cincyzoopic”  It’s been a big year for baby Fiona. After her birth in January 2017, she was the first Nile hippopotamus in captivity to survive being born six weeks prematurely.  Dedicated Cincinnati Zoo caretakers hand-raised her and gave her 24-hour care so that she would grow strong enough to be able to live at the zoo with her parents. She grew from 29 pounds to 500 pounds by September 23. Since then, she has inspired two books, an ice cream flavor and has gained worldwide attention.

"Click here if you are having a problem viewing the photos or video on a mobile device  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux, one of Hollywood’s most glamorous super couples, have split after just two and a half years of marriage, the Associated Press is reporting.  The two, who had been together as a couple for seven years, had been spending quite a bit of time apart in recent months, with Theroux often spotted in New York City away from their Los Angeles home, People reported.  The couple issued a statement through Aniston’s longtime publicist, saying that the decision to separate “was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year,” Page Six reported.  The couple also said they were making the announcement publicly, “in an effort to reduce any further speculation.”  “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,” the statement read. “Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”  The “Friends” star, 49, and Theroux, 46, a screenwriter and actor lauded for his performance in HBO’s “The Leftovers,” were engaged in August of 2012. They married in August 2015 in an intimate but star-studded in the garden of their $21 million minimalist estate in Bel-Air. Jimmy Kimmel officiated, according to Harpers Bazaar.  Aniston was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005. As she and Pitt were breaking up, Pitt’s romance with Angelina Jolie became public.  The announcement that Aniston and Theroux are done comes just a few days after the actress celebrated her 49th birthday Sunday in Malibu with girlfriends, including Courtney Cox. Theroux, meanwhile, was across the country for New York fashion week, Us Weekly reported.  Sources recently told People that their busy schedules worked for both of them and helped their marriage.  “Justin often spends a few days in NYC by himself,” a source People. “When he is in NYC, Jen will catch up with friends and enjoys her own life. When Justin is in L.A., it’s very special for them. They socialize together with friends. They often go out to dinner or have people over.”  But Aniston told a story of marital bliss in a conversation with actress, comedian and writer Amy Sedaris, published in September in Harper’s Bazaar. The two shared happy memories of Aniston’s wedding to Theroux. Sedaris, who is a good friend of Theroux’, served as his “best man.”  “Everything about that wedding was perfect,” Sedaris said. “Everyone was dressed like a bunch of woodland creatures, and your dress looked so beautiful and breezy.”  Aniston said it was “fun” to revisit a video of the wedding Theroux had just given her.  But the actress, who has a passion for interior design, also talked about the challenges of working together on updating their Bel-Air mansion, which is featured on the March cover of Architectural Digest.  “They say building houses can make or break a couple,” Aniston said. “I was so used to doing it on my own, and there were moments when I was like, ‘Don’t say no so fast.’ I have this dialogue with my interior designer where I’ll go: ‘No. Hate it. Move. Next.’ That can sound a little abrupt, so I had to retool my attitude a bit. It wasn’t very hard because he loved whatever I brought to him.”"

"usapoliticsnow admin.A string of events this week has led to incredible results in a 23-year-old case that had gone completely cold. After a reporter for The Washington Examiner was shot dead in front of his home and a letter was sent to his editor on his behalf, an investigation began into the death of Clinton attorney Vince Foster. Foster’s death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide..With new evidence, Rep. Trey Gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of Vince Foster exhumed for autopsy. The body wasn’t autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. Forensic specialists examined the body last night at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, concluding that the cause of death for Mr. Foster should be changed from suicide to homicide..LT Col. James McFitting, head of the hospital’s forensics lab, told reporters in his office that Foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal. There would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time. The wounds were also in the back of his head, meaning unless he reached all the way around to make it look like a murder and fired two identical guns at the same time, the original story was impossible..The doctor who signed Foster’s death certificate died in a car crash a few months later and the police detectives who worked the case have both left the country, never to be seen again. Without the letter from the reporter, Mr. Foster may have never seen justice..The case has been turned over to the FBI, who has clear jurisdiction at this point, for the difficult task of connecting the dots from Foster’s death directly to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Director Comey has assured the congressional panel that he will personally see to it that all of the bureau’s resources are made available..In other words, Clinton will be getting away with murder…again.."
"During the presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has often criticized China, most often on economic grounds. But in the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 14, 2016, Trump also took a shot at China over foreign policy -- specifically for not doing enough to rein in its neighbor, North Korea.Trump said, ""China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to, but they taunt us.""With the secretive nation back in the news for its claimed (but unverified) hydrogen bomb test earlier this month, we wondered whether Trump was right that China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea.""When we took a closer look at this question, we found that experts on the region offered a nuanced answer. China, they said, does have notable influence over North Korea because it provides or enables transit for much of North Korea’s supply of goods from the outside world. But that influence, they added, falls well short of ""total control.""""China does not ‘control’ North Korea in any real sense of the word, but it has influence over North Korea -- perhaps not as much as we think, but more than Beijing is willing to acknowledge,"" said Evans J.R. Revere, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center for East Asia Policy Studies.Robert Ross, a China expert at Boston College and Harvard University, compared the relationship between China and North Korea to that between a parent and a teenager.""It’s similar to dealing with a rebellious adolescent,"" Ross said. ""Do the parents have total control? Perhaps – they provide food and shelter. But the cost to the parents of using such leverage can be prohibitive – driving a child out of the house and away from the family. China has much at stake in its strategic and economic relationship with North Korea. But is there total control? That is debatable.""China’s leverage over North KoreaThe strongest argument for China having significant control over North Korea stems from its role in trade, particularly food and fuel.North Korea has a lengthy land border with China -- its longest with any neighbor -- and while North Korea also has seaports, the rest of the world can more easily monitor shipments into those ports, making it preferable from North Korea’s perspective to move goods over land. Research by Stephan Haggard of the University of California-San Diego and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that China may account for as much as 80 percent of North Korea’s trade, and a similar percentage of its investment flows.""North Korea would face daunting economic problems if China were to fully exercise its leverage, for example by cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so,"" Haggard told PolitiFact.Why ‘total control’ is an exaggerationYet while China’s economic lifeline gives it leverage, that doesn’t mean it can simply wave a wand and make things happen in Pyongyang -- something one might reasonably assume when hearing Trump’s quote. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)For starters, China has worried -- with reason, experts say -- that pushing so hard that the current North Korean regime collapses would lead to a humanitarian disaster on its border.""China is reluctant to exercise its leverage, fearing possible effects of an economic breakdown on its border and an outflow of refugees,"" Haggard said.It also has become painfully obvious over the years that North Korea doesn’t exactly listen to outsiders.""Mr. Trump is correct that the Chinese have leverage, but it is leverage they would have to use with the North Korean regime resisting them with everything they had,"" said Joseph de Thomas, a professor of international affairs at Penn State University. ""This is hardly control.""Not only has North Korea thumbed its nose at the United Nations and world powers, but its government has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world. In fact, the country’s national ideology -- juche -- is undergirded by the concept of self-reliance.""North Korea is a country that prides itself on answering to no one and following no one's lead,"" Revere said. ""This has been a consistent element of North Korean behavior for decades, and is of course the reason why the regime is such a danger for the United States, for South Korea, the East Asia region, and the international community at large.""Indeed, despite North Korea’s heavy reliance on China for food, fuel and virtually all other goods, ""it is not clear that the leadership cares,"" said Ross of Boston College and Harvard. ""For decades the population has lived in extreme poverty, while the elite has fared very well.""Meanwhile, North Korea’s development of its nuclear program has given it a measure of strategic independence from China -- which only further complicates China’s situation.This was on display with the recent test of the purported hydrogen bomb.""China publicly and privately exhorted North Korea not to test nukes and missiles over the past few months, to no avail,"" said Scott A. Snyder, director of the program on U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""As a result, relations between China and North Korea are strained. Chinese President Xi has not met with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, while meeting six times with the South Korean leader.""That does not sound like a country in ""total control"" of another.Trump’s claim ""suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of both China and North Korea, both today and over the decades,"" Revere said. ""It is virtually certain that the Chinese were given no advance warning of the test, and Chinese anger was quite evident in the public statements the government made after the test. In the view of virtually every North Korea and China expert I know, the nuclear test was a slap in China's face, in addition to being a major challenge and threat to the international community.""Our rulingTrump said China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea.""He has a point that China holds significant leverage over North Korea if it wishes to exercise it, since China provides the vast majority of North Korea’s international trade, including food and fuel imports. But Trump’s assertion, even slightly hedged as it is, overlooks some significant limits to that leverage, notably the North Korean government’s willingness to follow its own drummer even if that means its people suffer. The fact that North Korea recently conducted a nuclear test over the strenuous objections of China suggests that Beijing lacks anything approaching ""total control"" over North Korea.The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False."

"Chatting openly about the challenges of having sex when pregnant is still fairly stigmatised, but Khloe Kardashian’s having none of it. She’s finding pregnancy sex pretty confronting and awkward – and she’s keen to talk about it. Quel surprise!  “For me it’s been interesting”  Khloe’s pregnant with her first baby, with partner Tristan Thompson, and it’s fair to say that she’s already pretty closely acquainted with the pregnancy journey, thanks to her family. Sister Kourtney has three kids, Kim also has three (carrying two of them herself) and her sister Kylie has a newborn. Tristan’s already navigated pregnancy, albeit in a separated way, too. He’s dad to one-year-old Prince with former partner Jordan Craig.  Khloe said she’d heard things about sexuality during pregnancy, and is now having her own evolving experience.  “I have always heard that women are extra horny when they’re pregnant,” Khloe posted on her blog, “but for me it’s been interesting.”  “Uncomfortable and limiting”  Khloe says she’s feeling considerably less nimble in the sack, but is attempting to adapt to her new dimensions.  “In the beginning, sex was the same. As I got into my third trimester and started to get bigger it became harder to have sex and a little more uncomfortable and limiting.”  The pair are apparently pushing on, and the mum-to-be notes that “amazing” Tristan ‘would never make me feel different in any way.'”  While her body is making her feel self-conscious and a little cumbersome, Khloe’s hanging in there and giving it her best shot. Because … IN LOVE. She notes that she’s probably not the only one feeling weirded out and admits she’s not used to being quite so passive.  “I’m sure it’s uncomfortable for a man to have sex with a pregnant woman too. Personally, I get uncomfortable and insecure. Also, you can’t move the same, so you kind of feel useless, LOL. But you just have to improvise and do the best you can,” she advised.  “I was just in shock”  Khloe recently revealed that she’d always wanted to have a baby, but assumed she would not be able to easily conceive due to some potential issues with her ovaries.  “When I got pregnant, I was just so surprised. ‘Cause you keep getting told — you know when you hear all these things about yourself, you just start believing them. And, I was just in shock. I think, as much as everybody else was,” Khloe recalls.  The couple confirmed the pregnancy in December of 2018, on Instagram. Then last month, Khloe hinted at her due date with a photo celebrating “officially 6 months”. This suggests she’s due in mid-late April – and we can not wait to find out the baby’s name!"
"Dean Unglert, green-eyed Ken doll and America’s boyfriend, is on many people’s short list to be the next Bachelor. And I mean, why wouldn’t he be? He’s smart (I think). He’s handsome. He’s funny. He’s handsome. Did we mention handsome? Where was I? Oh yeah, this dude began his Bachelorette tenure with a vaguely racist comment and he would STILL be a better Bachelor than the last like, five dudes we’ve had (minus Ben, you’re perfect). Let’s see… he doesn’t have a speech impediment, isn’t a raging misogynist, and also isn’t responsible for anyone’s death as far as we know, so sign me tf up. And by me I mean him. But also me. To compete on his season. Yeah, okay, you get it. Moving on.  Last night’s Men Tell All didn’t reveal who the next Bachelor would be, so it’s no surprise that #DeanforBachelor was trending on Twitter during the episode. I’m honestly just surprised that enough people were able to break themselves away from the spell Dean’s eyes cast upon them for long enough to create a hashtag, but I would like to thank those heroic Americans for their service to this country. But will Dean Unglert be the next Bachelor? Sorry, Deanie Babies. It’s not looking likely. Let’s look at the evidence.  Exhibit A: Dean is on Bachelor in Paradise. While I’m fully aware that being on Bachelor in Paradise does not preclude you from becoming The Bachelor, having Dean be on The Bachelorette and then Bachelor in Paradise two weeks later and THEN be The Bachelor seems like a lot. He would have to have Nick Viall levels of blackmail material on everyone working at ABC in order to pull that off, and I just don’t see that happening for a relative rookie to the franchise. However, I am in no way suggesting that my eyes, ears, or soul would tire of seeing Dean on my television screen, in case anyone from ABC is reading this. When it comes to how many consecutive hours of Dean I could feasibly watch on TV:  Exhibit B: Dean said he is not ready to be The Bachelor. I know—I’m already crafting my excuse to call out of work sick tomorrow so I can deal with this news, too. But it’s (reportedly) true. Dean supposedly told The Hollywood Reporter, which sounds like a fake news outlet if I’ve ever heard one, “I don’t think I’m ready yet, at this point in my life.” Dean’s right; he’s got to rack up a good thousand more Instagram followers before he can truly be “ready.” However, he did add, “Of course, I would never immediately dismiss any offer, but I’d really have to sit down and really think about it.” I think that’s our cue to create a GoFundMe to come up with the extra cash ABC needs to present Dean with an offer he can’t refuse, right? I’ll set one up just in case.  So I mean, who really knows what will happen. I think I speak for all of us when I say that if ABC tries to pull some fuckery and Nick Viall us again with some lame-ass dude from three seasons ago, I will personally burn the studio to the ground."

"Kim Kardashian made everyone at the 2017 Met Gala wait for her. She wasn't one of the first to arrive, but tweeted fans that she was ""on the way."" Still, she proved it was worth the wait in a gorgeous gown, attending solo without husband Kanye West.  While last year Kardashian went for a robot-chic look in a skin-tight metallic dress, this year she completely changed it up. The star is wearing a white, off-the-shoulder dress by designer Vivienne Westwood. We're not totally sure how it fits with the Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons theme, but it's pretty nonetheless.  Kardashian wears her bob sleek and straight, courtesy of stylist Michael Silva. Mario Dedivanovic did her makeup, of course. Like her dress, it's pretty and soft. We're drooling over her shimmery eyeshadow and pale-pink lipstick — both from Chanel. (The fact that she isn't wearing a shade from the KKW by Kylie Cosmetics lip collection is a bit of a miss though, TBH.)  Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images  If you watched this past week's episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, you'll know Kardashian is keeping a lower profile lately, after she was robbed in Paris. She's wearing less pricey jewels and less flashy hair and makeup. We totally get why she's nervous after her horrifying experience, but hope she's doing this pared-down look for herself — and no one else.  My whole life has changed, as far as how I travel and what security [I have],"" she told Ellen DeGeneres recently. ""I never thought I’d need security staying outside my door, even though I have a lot of jewelry. If you think about it, I should have had security outside my door 24/7 when I’m traveling. And I didn’t. Now, I have several just so I can be able to sleep at night.""  For more on Met Gala 2017:  The Craziest Hairstyles from the Met Gala:"
"Heather Locklear has reportedly been hit with three new charges stemming from her arrest in which she allegedly assaulted police office and an EMT.  According to TMZ, the troubled actress was charged Thursday with one misdemeanor count of interfering with a law enforcement officer and two counts of misdemeanor battery for allegedly attacking first responders.  How Heather Locklear went from TV's hottest actress to struggling star  Ventura County Superior Court records show that Locklear will have a misdemeanor pre-trial hearing on Thursday as well.  Locklear was arrested in February for felony domestic violence and battery on a police officer after an ensuing fight with her boyfriend at her home in Los Angeles.  She was charged with five criminal counts in that case, but was not charged with hitting her boyfriend despite being arrested for the offense.  In June, Locklear was hospitalized and placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold after she allegedly choked her father and struck her mother.  The ""Melrose Place"" alum voluntarily entered rehab following her release.  Locklear is best known for appearing on ""Dynasty"" and ""T.J. Hooker"" in the 1980s and ""Melrose Place"" in the 1990s. She was arrested after the incident in February and posted her $20,000 bail.  She had issues with substance abuse in the past and most recently entered rehab last year. She was arrested previously in 2008 on suspicion of driving under the influence. However, the charges were later dismissed.  She was sentenced at the time to three years of informal probation and ordered to pay $700 as a fine and to take a driving safety class.  Fox News' Leora Arnowitz contributed to this report."
"Meghan Markle’s latest role as Britain’s Duchess of Sussex has come with a unique set of problems — all thanks to several estranged family members constantly speaking to the press.  “Meghan is absolutely broken by the drama with her father,” a source close to the former “Suits” star told Us Weekly Wednesday. “There’s no way she can have a relationship with him or even reach out to him to stop him from speaking. She knows he’ll record the conversation and sell it. She has high anxiety wondering if this will go on forever.”  Despite her public woes, the 37-year-old has received support from her grandmother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II.  “What may surprise some is just how supportive Her Majesty has been during the problems Meghan has faced with her family,” claimed a Buckingham Palace insider. “Meghan is in a tough place, and the queen knows it’s completely out of Meghan’s hands. She has only sympathy for what’s been a difficult and distressing situation for her.”  The palace insider added the 92-year-old monarch has great admiration for the American actress, who became the newest member of the House of Windsor when she married Prince Harry in May.  “While Meghan and the queen come from two very different backgrounds and generations, there’s a warmth between the two that’s genuine and loving,” said the source.  Harry, 33, was determined to make sure Elizabeth and Markle had a close bond.  “He wanted to make sure every family member knew that the queen supported the relationship and how important it would be for Meghan, who’s from a very different background, to feel welcomed and supported,” said another source.  The insider added it was Harry who requested a sit-down with his grandmother when he knew his romance with Markle was getting serious.  “The queen became fond of Meghan at their first meeting,” said the insider. “Not just because she’s the charming woman who brought happiness into her grandson’s life, but also because she quickly demonstrated that she’s intelligent, polite and keen to learn.”  Just days before Meghan walked down the aisle in front of millions to marry Harry, she announced her father wouldn’t attend the royal wedding following his heart surgery.  “Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding,” she said in a statement released by Kensington Palace. “I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.  “I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.”  Kensington Palace then announced Meghan would be walked down the aisle by Prince Charles, Harry’s father.  Markle’s surgery followed days of press surrounding his health and speculation on whether or not he’d attend the royal wedding.  He also stirred headlines when it was revealed he staged paparazzi photos that showed him preparing for the big day.  Back in January, Grant, 53, told Fox News she and her family are new to the spotlight and it can be difficult to cope with the worldwide interest in their personal lives.  “As much as I love and respect Meg, she’s got security and a publicist and can be protected from all that,” said Grant. “She and Harry can tell the media to stop. The rest of the family doesn’t have that luxury. I love her, [but] she may not want me saying anything.  “I refuse to be a victim of the media. I’m not going to let them disparage me, embarrass me personally and professionally and not defend myself… I can only hope she would respect and understand that… In fact, if I were Meg, I would probably put something out there so that there was some sort of protective mechanism in place where the family couldn’t be tortured as much."""

"As per usual, one of Hollywood's favorite couples left fans swooning. This time, it didn't take much to muster up all of the lovey dovey feels — just two black jackets. A photo of Selena Gomez and The Weeknd's matching outfits takes #relationshipgoals to new levels and proves a tough but chic look is a perfect date ensemble.  The lovebirds hit New York City on Saturday, Sept. 2 — the first fall-like day in the Big Apple — with black garb that's perfect for the cooler days ahead. Gomez's biker jacket sported a punk rock look that she complimented with a dash of red thanks to (presumably) one of her designer Coach bags. The Weeknd's jacket sported a more casual feel. The two, ironically enough, headed for The Vintage Twin in SoHo, so they had the whole twinning thing on lock.  Since it was one of the first days in New York where you needed a jacket, you gotta hit the downtown streets in style. These two were totally up for the challenge and didn't overdo the whole ""it's getting cold"" look. Some New Yorkers were walking around in scarves and heavy coats, but we're not quite at that point just yet, folks. This day-date outfit was the perfect in between.  To take their East Coast date up a notch, Gomez and The Weeknd also stopped to peruse a New York City store, but not just any store — the store. You get where I'm going with this. The two were spotted in a pet store, according to Hollywood Life, and that means serious business. As the saying goes, ""at the end of the day, it's all about who you want to own a dog with.""  Though the two were very clearly missing from this year's VMAs — leaving fans in a tizzy — they deserve a little R&R for themselves. Enjoy the city, you two. Hope you find a super adorable puppy!"
"The 75th Golden Globe awards will soon be upon us. The annual ceremony brings together the biggest names in film and television for a boozy celebration of the previous year’s work, kicking off the season of acceptance speeches and red-carpet arrivals that culminates with the doling out of Oscars in early March.  Here’s what to know about the 2018 Golden Globes awards ceremony.  When are the Golden Globes?  The Golden Globes 2018 date is Sunday, Jan. 7. The awards will be broadcast live from the Beverly Hilton Hotel on NBC starting at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PST. Check out where you can watch or stream the Golden Globes online for free.  Who is hosting the Golden Globes?  Late Night‘s Seth Meyers will host the 2018 Golden Globes, taking the baton from Jimmy Fallon, who presented the awards last year. Meyers joins a line of hosts that has previously included Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and Ricky Gervais — and he takes on the job as Hollywood continues to reel from numerous claims of sexual harassment and assault within the industry.

Who are the Golden Globe nominees?  The 2018 Golden Globes nominations were announced Dec. 11, with the The Shape of Water leading the pack among movies with seven nominations. The Post and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri followed, with six nods each, while Lady Bird scooped up four nominations. Big Little Lies dominated on the TV side with six nominations, while Feud: Bette and Joan received four nods. Fargo, This Is Us and The Handmaid’s Tale each received three nominations.  One of the year’s biggest snubs came in the Best Director category, where no women were nominated. Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird), Patty Jenkins (Wonder Woman) and Dee Rees (Mudbound) were all passed over, despite directing some of the most critically acclaimed movies of the year. Other films that didn’t make the cut despite buzzy reception include The Big Sick and Mother!. For more, see this full list of 2018 Golden Globes nominees.  Who votes for the Golden Globes?  Golden Globes nominees rarely know who exactly is voting for them. The voters belong to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of about 90 journalists from all over the world that is rather secretive about the identities of its members.  Will anything be different about this year’s ceremony?  Yes, at least on the Golden Globes red carpet: Multiple high-profile actresses are reportedly planning to wear black to the ceremony to protest sexual harassment in Hollywood. According to People, participating nominees including Jessica Chastain, Emma Stone and Meryl Streep, among other women, plan to wear black dresses to the Golden Globes, and possibly to more events throughout awards season. Reports also indicate that many male actors, including Dwayne Johnson, intend to wear black in solidarity. Expect fewer questions about who attendees are wearing on the red carpet and more about why they’re wearing it.  Write to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com."
"In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the anthropomorphic tree-man Groot is no longer the towering, full-sized version voiced by Vin Diesel in the first film, but rather a pint-sized pipsqueak known as Baby Groot. This is because [clears throat for spoilers] according to writer and director James Gunn, the Groot we knew is dead. At the end of the first Guardians of the Galaxy, Groot wraps his tree-limbs into a sturdy wooden bubble to protect his pals as their ship falls from the sky. When it crashes, he shatters into a pile of kindling. His friends mourn, his partner Rocket plucks a twig from the wreckage, and regrows Groot into a dancing sprout. By the end of the second Guardians movie, Baby Groot is growing up.  According to director James Gunn, however, that wasn’t Groot using his neat regeneration powers, and he’s never going to grow back into the original Groot. Protesting a tweet asking “Who would you save, Baby Groot or a porg?” he points out that Baby Groot is an entirely new being that is, at best, a son.  First Groot is dead. Baby Groot is his son. — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 27, 2018  This isn’t the first time Gunn has mentioned this tidbit, which never fails to get Guardians of the Galaxy and Groot fans worked up. In a 2017 Facebook post, Gunn wrote, “I do think it’s more obvious in Vol. 2, as Baby Groot has a different personality than Groot, none of his memories, and is much, much dumber.” When the issue resurfaced today, Gunn lamented on Twitter, “The internet is like Groundhog Day every time I point out first Groot died.” This time, however, the news seems to have gone viral, leading Gunn to repeatedly emphasize the point to people asking questions and freaking out.  Of course they are. Would you think an infant was your dead grandfather? That little jerk has not clue what’s going on. — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 27, 2018  It’s canon AF (and it’s in the movies). — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 27, 2018  Given that Guardians of the Galaxy takes place in a fictional universe that includes talking raccoons, a scientific analysis may be beside the point. But if I were to push up my glasses here and talk about the technicalities, I might mention that asexual plant reproduction à la stem-cutting — like Rocket growing a new Groot from a twig — would actually qualify as a clone. That’s because the new plant is genetically identical to the original, which means it’s not necessarily offspring. But I’m not here to get into a science fight!  What I do take issue with is Gunn implying that everyone who is shocked by this news is a dummy. James, my man, it is certainly not clear from the first film that the Groot sprout is not, in fact, the old Groot. Groot shows off his regenerative powers early in the film; the principle of Chekov’s gun would lead us, as viewers, to assume these facts are related. As for why Baby Groot is so stupid in the second film? I mean… he has a tiny baby brain. Have you ever met a baby? They’re dumb.  Gunn wants Groot’s sacrifice in the first film to carry weight. But this Groundhog Day-style revelation he talks about muddies the revelatory waters. If he is in fact introducing a new Groot at the end of the first film, the timing is confusing at best. Offering up a cuter, tinier version of the same character in the credits is an emotional salve to heal up the wounds caused by Groot’s death before anyone leaves their seats, whether it’s a son, a clone, or just a great merchandising opportunity."

"By AM Conservative Post authorFareed Zakaria, CNN host of ‘Foreign Affairs,’ has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by Islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in The Washington Post.Zakaria’s blog post unapologetically calls to increase the death rate of white Middle America by systematically targeting Caucasian females.“The white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes. While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the ‘white question’ will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.Thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.”The blog post was removed from Zakaria’s blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.CNN officials have refused to take action against their employee.“Every death of a white person brings tears of joy to my eyes,” Zakaria posted on his Twitter account shortly after having to remove his blog post, in what is believed to be a passive-aggressive response to his critics.Photo Credit: World Economic Forum"
"Expanding their brood! Seth Meyers’ wife, Alexi Ashe, is pregnant and expecting the couple’s second child together.  Meyers announced the news on Thursday, November 23, during the Thanksgiving episode of Late Night With Seth Meyers, alongside his parents, Larry and Hilary Meyers, and his brother Josh, who were his guests on the show.  “I want to take this opportunity now, you guys obviously know, my wife and I are expecting a second baby,” the late-night host said. “Very excited. Thank you! Very excited.”  His mother told the audience the story of when her son called her to give her the good news. “I get the phone call, and my Seth is sometimes a crier. He’s sobbing,” she said. “He said, ‘Because for over a month, I’ve had to pretend that I don’t care what sex it is and I do care, I want a little boy!’”  The comedian, who welcomed his first son Ashe in 2016, said: “That’s true, I really wanted a brother for my son because I was so lucky to have one.”  The Saturday Night Live alum, 43, and the human rights lawyer announced their first pregnancy in September 2015 while attending New York’s Natural History Museum Gala.  “They are so thrilled to become parents and were so happy to share the exciting news with friends and cast members from SNL last night,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time.  The couple wed in September 2013 in front of family and friends at Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. Although the late-night host typically holds back from commenting on his marriage, he did share a sweet memory back in 2014 of Ashe trying on her wedding gown.  “I will never forget the first time she returned from her fitting because she was happier than I’ve ever seen her,” Meyers gushed at the time while attending a NYC luncheon. “Which was a little jarring for me because I had recently proposed to her. Turns out getting a ring from me is less exciting than having Carolina Herrera creating your dress.”  The Late Night With Seth Meyers host also poked fun at Ashe for having food poising the night before their nuptials. “In a testament to my wife’s will and my wife’s strength, she got herself pumped full of fluids, and she railed it and made it to the ceremony,” he said. “When she walked out in her Herrera wedding dress, she looked more beautiful than I had ever seen her look.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Back home, Selena shared that she was in the studio, hopefully writing more songs about her dude. As far as we know, there’s nothing in the works about Orlando!

"Taylor Swift performs during her '1989' Secret Session with iHeartRadio on Oct. 27, 2014 in New York City. (Photo: Todd Owyoung, for iHeartRadio)  A younger-than-normal audience packed The View's studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person. Swift's new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.  ""I wasn't necessarily nervous about this album,"" Swift said. ""I think my label might have been a little nervous but they'll never say it now.""  Swift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.  ""I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,"" Swift told the View co-hosts. ""I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn't want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that's never the intention.""  With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.  ""It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,"" Swift said. ""I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.""  Whether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable. Confident as she may be, Swift admits that she still fears failure.  ""How do you not know how awesome you are?"" Nicolle Wallace asked.  ""I keep a nice healthy level of insecurity going at all times,"" said Swift.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Celebrities have always raised eyebrows over their religion of choice – for Tom Cruise and John Travolta it's Scientology, while the likes of Madonna and Ashton Kutcher were proud followers of Kabbalah for a long time.  And now it's Justin Bieber's turn to spark controversy with his reported closeness to Hillsong Church, a global strand of Christianity that looks to recruit followers with music, dancing and community care projects.  But Hillsong has also faced accusations that it acts as a cult, as well as allegedly having attempted to cover up the child abuse allegations levelled against its founder's father.  It is also accused of pushing its congregations to donate cash and of using Bible verses selectively to set its own agenda.  So what is Hillsong Church? How is Bieber involved? And why do so many of its detractors believe it's a modern-day cult?  (Image: Splash News)  (Image: Splash News)  Hillsong and child abuse  Brian Houston, who founded the Pentecostal Christian movement in Australia, stood down his own father, William 'Frank' Houston, as a preacher in 1999 after hearing an allegation that Frank had sexually abused a seven-year-old boy.  In a letter sent to church leaders in 2001, Brian claimed that there was no reason for the information to be spread any further afield, prompting claims of an attempted cover-up when the letter was leaked.  ""Sadly there are always one or two people with their own agendas who will try and get mileage from other people's pain,"" Brian's missive told ministers.  Frank would go on to leave Hillsong and died of a stroke in 2004. Fresh allegations that he'd molested six other children in New Zealand in previous decades continued to dog the organisation.  An investigation by Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found none of the allegations against Frank Houston were ever reported to police.  The commission's report found Frank had sexually abused the seven-year-old boy, and had later admitted it to an assembly of church executives.  Hillsong 'using selective Bible verses' to encourage hefty donations  (Image: Splash News)  (Image: Splash News)  Those who have been to Hillsong services report that leaders are swift to imply followers must give as much money as they can to the church.  In Hillsong's own FAQs, there are six different ways to donate money listed - including using the church's own app to transfer money immediately. There are also calls on its website to set up a direct deposit or have an online account so cash can be sent electronically.  As with many other churches, Hillsong followers will find empty envelopes left on their chairs ahead of services to be filled with money or standing order forms, which are collected up by staff. Collection buckets are also sent around the church during a service, with the congregation urged to dig deep.  Hillsong also uses Bible verses, such as Proverbs, to encourage its followers to donate generously. ""The godly love to give,"" its own site quotes.  The movement is big on ""the Biblical principle of tithing"", which requests that believers donate the first ten per cent of their income to the church.  ""Tithes and Offerings received at Hillsong fund the vision and activities of our church,"" says Hillsong.  The 2016 Hillsong Church annual report found donations made up over half of its revenue - with another 19% stemming from the dozens of Christian rock albums it produces.  Hillsong and homosexuality  Hillsong does not believe in homosexuality, in line with the Old Testament, nor does it agree with equal marriage. When a director of one of its church's choir was found to be in a committed gay relationship, Hillsong's founder issued a statement clarifying that the news came as ""a complete surprise"".  In a blog post, Brian Houston told his followers: ""Hillsong Church welcomes ALL people but does not affirm all lifestyles.  ""Put clearly, we do not affirm a gay lifestyle and because of this we do not knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid.""  Justin Bieber was accused of homophobia in 2016 after reportedly turning down a role in Uber Girl, reportedly because his character would have a sex scene with another man, the film's co-writer Pete O'Neill claimed.  However, Bieber's rep said at the time there was ""no truth"" to his being offered the role in the first place.  Speaking in tongues  (Image: Splash News)  The act of speaking in tongues - or in a language that needs a special person to interpret - has long been associated with the Pentecostal churches.  ""We believe that in order to live the holy and fruitful lives that God intends for us, we need to be baptised in water and be filled with the power of the Holy Spirit,"" the church states on its site.  ""The Holy Spirit enables us to use spiritual gifts, including speaking in tongues.""  But many Christians believe it amounts to 'false worship' and 'showmanship', including members of a Facebook group who claim to be former followers of Hillsong.  One member, who said they had been involved in Hillsong for a few years in their early twenties, said church elders believed those who had been 'saved' would be given the gift of speaking in tongues.  (Image: carllentz/Instagram)  They also claimed to have been disturbed by one pastor's 'healing' service.  ""A visiting pastor performed a 'healing' show, calling out people wanting healing to the stage,"" they recalled.  ""Some people went up and were 'healed'. This didn't sit right with me because there was a wheelchair bound person in the room who was ignored. Was this beyond God's power? Could God only heal afflictions that have no visible sign of it actually being healed? How must that wheelchair bound person have felt? I imagine he'd be thinking 'my faith must not be good enough yet'.""

According to GQ, the troubled pop star moved into Carl's home after a period of car-crash media stories and reputational crisis. While he was there the two ""worked through some stuff"" and Bieber cried that he ""wanted to know Jesus"" before begging on his knees to be baptised.  He's since attended Hillsong services and conferences - and was even suspected of cancelling the rest of his Purpose world tour in July 2017 so he could found his own branch of the church.  Pandering to celebrities  (Image: Splash News)  (Image: Splash News)  It's not just Bieber who's known to follow Hillsong - his friends Kendall Jenner, Hailey Baldwin and ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez have also been linked to the religious movement.  While it attracts a cool, millennial-focused crowd, Hillsong believes all souls need to 'know Jesus' - but celebrities appear to have a special place in its pecking order.  ""People say we cater to celebrities and I say, yes, we do,"" Pastor Carl told GQ.  ""Celebrities deserve a relationship with God. Celebrities deserve a place to pray.""  Is Hillsong a cult?  (Image: Splash News)  (Image: Splash News)  The church elders have batted away accusations that the movement is a cult - certainly, its followers seem to have made up their own minds about it.  But many of the movement's detractors claim Hillsong's focus on charismatic preachers, music and song-based performances, and its push for funds and donations give the church a sinister spin.  However, Bobbie Houston, who helped husband Brian found Hillsong, has previously denied any cult claims, insisting followers simply wish to worship their god."
"32 SHARES Share Tweet Whatsapp  Jamie Dornan has become a sex symbol since taking on the role of Christian Grey in the “Fifty Shades” franchise. While many would assume he’s always been successful with the ladies, that was not the case when he was younger.  During his recent appearance at the Graham Norton Show, the 35-year-old actor revealed that he went through great lengths to impress girls in order to “get lucky”. Just like many others, Dornan too had a typical awkward teenager story. Although one might say, his embarrassing story is more R-rated than romantic.  In “one of the worst stories in my locker”, Dornan recalled, “I was quite small and wasn’t hairy at all – I was 15 and looked seven. On one particular day, I was in an amateur drama play and was going to a party after. For my role, I had bits of a black wig glued to my face for a beard and I decided to keep it for the party so I would look older. I also decided to cut up the rest of wig and glue it to my private parts just in case I got lucky“.  That reckless move backfired on the young Brit when it came time to remove the improvised pubic hair. “I didn’t get lucky and removing the bits of wig ripped out the very small amount of natural hair I had down there. It was a physically and emotionally painful experience!”  During the interview, the handsome star also shared about the “awful” scene to shoot in “Fifty Shades Freed“. In the movie trailer, we see the shirtless Christian Grey in blue shorts walking out of the beach in France. “That was horrendous. If they just tilt the camera down, that whole moment was awful,” Dornan told the host.  “We had the beach, semi-sort of closed off, but actually there were loads of people that we didn’t have control over.They want me to be sexy coming out of the water. But it’s not a sand beach! It’s one of those wee pebble beaches. Literally, you cannot look cool running out of the water,” he added.  Watch his confessions here:  Honestly, his awkwardness just makes adorable 😉  Sources: Just Jared, Daily Mail."
"Fake news and fake history of family separation  Straight talk  By George H. Rodriguez  The liberal Washington Post is joining the chorus of pro-one borders, pro-illegal immigration groups that are upset that illegal alien families are being separated by immigration officials. They write an emotional opinion piece that manipulates historical facts.  Writer DeNeen L. Brown says America has a history of separating children from families. She uses Native American and black slave children as examples to compare to illegal alien children being separated from their illegal alien parents. But the differences in these three situations are great. How can anyone but a liberal blinded by misguided sympathy ignore the facts?  Native Americans did not come to the U.S. illegally from a foreign country. The policy of separating children from their families was terrible because they were American and they had not done anything wrong. Blacks were forced to come to the U.S. chained to ships and forced to work without pay or benefits. They had committed no crime other than to be a different skin.  Illegal aliens are foreigners who are not forced to come to the United States. They come willingly and, because of their decision, receive legal help, shelter, and food upon arrival and the detainment, even though they broke immigration laws. Illegal aliens make their own decision to travel to the U.S., endangering themselves and their children — the result of breaking immigration laws is the separation of children and families. That’s the same as anyone who commits a crime, especially if they have children along with them when they commit the crime.  This seems to be another liberal media effort to make America look evil for protecting and controlling its borders.  What part of the word illegal don’t Ms. Brown and the Washington Post understand? Illegal aliens come here willingly and of their own decision, bringing and endangering their children. That was not the case with Native American and black slave children.  The “humane” solution is to deport the entire family quickly. We cannot continue to excuse and reward illegal immigration, and we cannot allow our nation to turn into the world’s orphanage for illegal alien children.  George Rodriguez, El Conservador."
"Bless Joe Alwyn for teaching Taylor Swift the value of keeping her personal life private, Us Weekly enthusiastically reports, because her happiness these days is unparalleled! The tabloid got a detailed report on how madly in love Swift is with Alwyn's and her secret(ish) relationship.  “Joe has really showed her a different lifestyle and the value of privacy,” a source told the outlet. “She’s the happiest she’s ever been.”  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  This shift has drastically improved Swift's life, a source added. “Taylor is so much happier without her personal life in the open. She credits Joe for that and realizes how much better off she is.”  Swift, for one of the first times in the public eye, has not talked about Alwyn in any interviews. She has barely been photographed out with him, though this week they were shot holding hands in Turks and Caicos. “They seemed genuinely happy,” a witness there told Us of their interactions out and about there. “They were always smiling and close to each other, but kept to themselves.”  Swift isn't about to say anything about Alwyn though, another source cautioned the outlet.

"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23."
"Taylor Swift is turning 28 on Dec. 13 and we’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how BF Joe Alwyn has a romantic night in store to celebrate with his superstar sweetie.  What do you get a birthday girl who already has everything she could wish for? In Joe Alwyn‘s case, the 26-year-old is giving the gift of love and romance to girlfriend Taylor Swift as she turns 28 on Dec. 13. “Joe is planning a surprise romantic dinner and an intimate night alone with Taylor at a luxury hotel suite to help celebrate her birthday. Their romance has been amazing lately and Joe can’t wait to surprise Taylor with a passionate evening with just the two of them. Taylor and Joe are really falling in love with each other and things have never been better,” a source close to the British actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  “Joe has ordered dozens of red roses for their suite, several bottles of champagne and he is having a private chef who will cook them dinner and recreate one of her favorite dishes as part of their meal, sweet potato pancakes normally found at her favorite restaurant in Nashville. After a year of dating on the down-low, Taylor has slowly been allowing herself to be seen out in public with Joe. The “Ready For It” singer allowed herself to be photographed holding hands with Joe as they headed into her NYC pad’s front entrance on Dec. 9. She has a more private way to come and go from the place so it was a BIG DEAL that she finally was photographed showing PDA with him. See pics of Taylor’s epic 2017, here.  The next night she performed at London’s Jingle Ball and Tay was spotted out in the audience with Joe during pal Ed Sheeran‘s set. She had her arm around him while singing along to Ed’s smash “Thinking Out Loud” and was spotted hugging her boyfriend during other songs in the set. Fans freaked and posted the videos to Twitter and it was clear she is a-okay with the world knowing she’s with Joe.  HollywoodLifers, what’s the best birthday present you’ve ever received?"

"There's a chance for another Brad and Jen, but this time it isn't Jennifer Aniston. Multiple reports are claiming that Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Pitt are now dating.  Both stars are newly single, Lawrence recently split from director boyfriend Darren Aronofsky and Pitt is in the process of divorcing longtime partner and wife of two years, Angelia Jolie.  Rumors of their romance began on Wednesday and the story graces the cover of this week’s issue of Star Magazine. Sources told the publication that “Brad has had his eye on Jennifer for years. [They] have been enjoying lots of late nights together. There’s an intense connection between them!”  An insider also told the magazine that Pitt allegedly reached out to Lawrence after getting her phone number from a mutual friend. The source added that Pitt was nervous to contact Lawrence, but was encouraged by friends to make the first move.  However, the tabloid checking website Gossip Cop reported that despite reports about the two A-listers becoming a pair, for now the rumors remain just rumors.  According to The Sun, Lawrence broke up with Aronofsy after a year of dating due to their great difference in age. But age hasn’t seemed to stop Lawrence before. Before dating Aronofsky, Lawrence had a short fling with Coldplay lead singer and ex-husband a Gwyneth Paltrow, Chris Martin — Paltrow being another common thread between her and Brad.  Prior to dating Martin, Lawrence dated her 28-year-old “X-Men” co-star, Nicolas Hoult, for five years off and on. The two ended their relationship in August of 2014.  The Sun also reported that sources close to Pitt have denied the dating rumors and said that he and Lawrence are not together."

"GETTY Elephants at watering hole  It may not sound as if we’re heading out on a wild South African adventure but this is how our safari begins. We’re wrapped up all warm and cosy in a Land Cruiser while our guide, wearing nothing more than shorts and a T-shirt, turns and asks what we want to see. Lets go find some cats, we say. As the sun rises we bound off into Kruger National Park on a jeep convoy.  Thousands of animals roam this vast space, an area roughly the size of Scotland. While the park is home to 147 species, the main draw is the Big Five – that’s lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo. Picking our way through the bush it’s difficult to spot anything. There are rustles and strange sounds in the long grass but I can’t see any animals. The tracker perched on the bonnet with his rifle is much better at it. Despite (and very probably because of) being at risk of predators, he seems to notice the smallest of movements in the distance – he’s an expert at finding exotic shapes, everything from hippos and lone giraffes to zebras.  African wildlife up close and personal Mon, June 6, 2016 Penny Robartes, a Photo Tour Leader for ORYX captured these stunning up close and personal wildlife images. www.oryxphotography.com Play slideshow Penny Robartes, ORYX 1 of 17 As a wildlife photographer, I constantly have to be aware of the scene around the subject I'm wanting to photograph. The background is as important as the animal. Arriving at the scene of sleeping lions, I was very aware of the beautiful colours behind hi  Every now and again we stop to look at footprints and even fresh poop.  The main draw is the Big Five – that’s lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo  It looks like elephants passed through overnight. The rangers can read what direction they took and even how long ago. Soon enough, we gasp and nudge each other as he sights a leopard through the trees. It’s hunting something that we can’t make out. Impressed to find it stalking prey, we sit watching in silence. We see another safari vehicle and they report there are elephants near the river so we decide to leave our hungry feline to hunt alone.  NATALIE CHALK Nathalie Chalk on safari  The ground is dry and cracked due to a two-year drought, which has left parts of the park looking scorched with dead trees and uprooted branches. It’s hard to see how anything could thrive in this landscape. Yet as we approach the river, it’s like we enter a different country. There are lush mahogany and marula fruit trees – a favourite snack of the park’s vast herds of elephants. And this is where we find once such group.  GETTY The main draw is the Big Five – that’s lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo  On the banks are 30 elephants, including babies, close to their mothers, young bulls jumping on each other and adult males spraying water. It’s like being backstage on a David Attenborough documentary – peeking into their secret lives off-camera. As our guide talks quietly about how an elephant’s ear resembles the shape of Africa, they begin to stroll our way. The herd is making its way to the road and coming straight towards the vehicle. It’s an uncomfortable mixture of excitement and terror. As we look at them, they stare back. Some of us get nervous. We hold our breath, grit our teeth and fall silent as they get closer. I am about to be nuzzled by the largest land animal on Earth.  I wish I had good rapport with nature. Instead I want to slide down the seat in front and hide under my blanket. Before turning to stone, I remember thinking what long eyelashes they have. Soon we are surrounded as they cross behind and in front. Some swing their trunks, which is how they smell, while others walk by munching on prickly branches. It’s the mother who stands guard. The guide tells us not to worry but we’re not convinced.  SABI SABI The Bush Lodge at Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve  He speaks in a calm voice to the elephants saying the baby is safe and they can pass. He’d better know what he’s doing, I pray. The ploy works and after 40 minutes, the herd strides off at their own slow pace. When they are far away enough, we all breathe out. Now that was worth getting up for. We’re welcomed back to safety of Bush Lodge at Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve just before 10am with warm face cloths and drinks. Being on a game drive can make you hungry so I have a three-course feast, filling up at the buffet, ordering eggs benedict and washing it down with a glass of bubbly and a muffin to celebrate our once-ina-lifetime experience.  WIREIMAGE Prince Harry stayed at the Bush Lodge at Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve earlier this year  The lodge is a labour of love for managers Lauren and her husband Rod who take care of a cluster of 25 fi ve-star suites all offering panoramas of the bush. Inside, it has an Out Of Africa feel with its thatched roof, wooden tables and animal artefacts on the walls. It’s no wonder Prince Harry stayed here earlier this year. Everyone though is treated like royalty with guides escorting you back to your room each night. You couldn’t be closer to wildlife, with baboons swinging from the furniture and impalas on the doorstep. The next morning the birds act as our wake-up call. We bounce along the plains spotting a skipping baby rhino with its mother.  It wasn’t until the afternoon drive that we’d get to see all of the Big Five. As we head back to camp, word comes over the radio of a lion killing a buffalo. We arrive in darkness to watch the mother at work. With Sabi Sabi we don’t share our finds with other safari tours. As a private reserve, it has its own plot of the park, which if we duck under the branches, we can drive off road to follow animals. Visitors on a self-drive on Kruger’s public roads must stick to the tracks. Dinner back at the lodge is served under the stars at a boma (an enclosure traditionally used for livestock) with a barbecue.  SABI SABI Everyone is treated like royalty at the lodge"
"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Corey Feldman‘s long-awaited documentary on child sexual abuse in Hollywood has a harrowing title.  The “Lost Boys” star named his film “Truth: The Rape of 2 Coreys,” focusing on his sexual assault and the alleged rape of his late longtime friend and fellow child star, Corey Haim.  “I believe this title represents the truth I have been promising to tell and it also represents the truth of what happened,” Feldman, 47, told Us Weekly on Tuesday. “[Haim] was physically raped, I was physically assaulted and as a result of those actions, and the fact that I had to carry that burden all those years, really it was a raping of not only our emotional lives, but also our collective work and career as The Two Coreys.”  Last year, Feldman launched an IndieGogo campaign seeking $10 million to “create an affront” against child sexual abuse and expose an alleged pedophilia ring with his movie.  “I propose to do this by making a film that will be [the most] honest and true depiction of child abuse ever portrayed, by telling my own story in a very real way, in a very honest way, with no editing, no censorship, no studio behind it,” he said in a video about the “Truth project.” “I will make the film, I will direct the film, I will produce the film, and I will self-distribute it to guarantee it gets a theatrical release with your donations. Additionally, it will help me buy the security and the legal team I need to protect my family until the project is released.”  Feldman’s allegations of pedophilia in Hollywood have resurfaced in light of sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and director James Toback.  The “Stand By Me” actor’s 2013 appearance on “The View,” in which Barbara Walters chided him for speaking out against “an entire industry,” went viral last year.  The news of Haim’s portrayal in Feldman’s film may not sit well with the late actor’s mother.  Judy Haim previously slammed Feldman for speaking of Corey Haim’s alleged sexual assault and abuse, even sending him a cease and desist in 2016, after which Feldman promised he’d stop talking about Corey Haim in the press.  She was particularly incensed at reports that a then-19-year-old Charlie Sheen allegedly raped Corey Haim when Haim was 13 on the set of “Lucas,” an accusation Sheen himself has denied — and sued over."

"A diva is the female version of a hustla…or maybe just a pregnant Kardashian-Jenner sister. Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian — who both have babies on the way with their respective boyfriends, Travis Scott and Tristan Thompson — reportedly have crazy demands for their upcoming deliveries.  According to OK! Magazine, Kylie, 20, and Khloé, 33, are “already driving the staff at LA’s Cedars-Sinai hospital nuts.” While the Kylie Cosmetics founder has requested a completely stocked snack bar for her hospital room, KoKo is demanding that her room includes a brand-new bathtub in case she decides to have an underwater birth. On top of that, an insider tells the publication that both moms-to-be have decided that light gray, 1,000-thread count sheets are a necessity during their deliveries.  A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Oct 9, 2017 at 2:45pm PDT  Though both Keeping Up With the Kardashians beauties have buns in the oven, neither have confirmed the exciting baby news themselves. However, it seems that both reality stars are looking forward to first-time motherhood.  ""Tristan and I definitely talk about starting a family,” Khloé said on the last season of KUWTK. ""[Tristan] wants to have five or six kids with me and that's lovely. We could start at one and we could grow from there. But now knowing I'm not on birth control is just like — it's scary. It's like a really big step.”  For her part, Kylie has always wanted to have kids sooner than later. “I want kids for sure. I feel like seeing you guys go through everything, it’s great knowledge,” the lip kit queen said during a February 2016 episode of Kocktails With Khloé. “I feel like I want kids before I’m 30.”  More from Life & Style  Travis Scott Turns to Kanye West for Advice on Dealing With Kylie Jenner's Pregnancy (REPORT)  Kim Kardashian Wants Pregnant Kylie Jenner to Flaunt Her ""Sexy New Curves"" (REPORT)  Kylie Jenner's Latest Photo Has Fans Convinced That She's Pregnant With Twins"
"An insider says, “There’s no love lost between Taylor and Kendall these days, and what makes it super awkward is the fact they share so many friends.”  Of course, the Kardashians are not trying to be in the same room as Taylor or ever listen to her music, after she dissed Kanye West and Kim in her latest music video, “Look What You Made Me Do.”  At the end of the video, Taylor, clad in leopard, holds up a phone and says she’s “getting receipts” and will “edit them” too, which of course is a reference to her belief that Kim edited audio she released last year claiming Taylor approved of Kanye referring to her as a “b****” and saying he made her famous in his single, ""Famous.""  The source adds, “Since Taylor’s been in hiding Kendall’s very much the queen bee these days, so what she says goes for the majority of that group. She’s made it clear that anyone listening or supporting Taylor will be banned from her circle instantly, and the likes of Gigi, Bella and Cara are all doing as they’re told.”  But one of their mutual friends is caught in the middle, and it’s none other than Selena Gomez. The beauty “refuses” to distance herself from Taylor, which could spell t-r-o-u-b-l-e. No one wants to get one a Kardashian’s bad side!"

"Johnny Depp’s behavior on the red carpet premiere of his latest film “Murder on the Orient Express” was questioned on Saturday night after several news outlets accused the actor of showing up drunk.  The British newspaper The Sun reported that the actor “allegedly reeked of booze” when he appeared on the red carpet and his security team had to “practically hold him up” as he made his way down the press line.  Other outlets, The Daily Mail and The Mirror, alleged that Depp was guided down the red carpet past fans and slurred his words when interviewed.  “At one stage he even seemed to forget the name of his co-star (and the film’s director) Kenneth Branagh,” The Mirror reported.  RELATED: Hollywood agent suspended after Terry Crews’ public sexual harassment accusations  A source told The Sun that Depp was spotted out partying in London the night before the premiere and said, “Johnny was having big old night and was told off for smoking three times while inside. He was annoyed people were staring at him, too.”  Depp’s rep has not yet commented on the rumor though another source reportedly said that Depp was “not drunk” despite the bad press.  “These reports are completely false. Johnny was not drunk at the premiere. He came straight from set to the premiere,” a source told “E! News.” “His security was maneuvering him around the carpet as he has done for years.”  “Murder on the Orient Express” premieres in theaters on Nov. 10 and stars several of Depp’s previous co-stars, including Penelope Cruz, Michelle Pfeiffer, Leslie Odom Jr., Josh Gad and Judi Dench."
"Postby Guest » Sun Jun 14, 2009 3:22 pm  So things started going downhill after Jen was at the academy Awards show. And smiled at Pitt. Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that"

"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Eun Kyung Kim  One of the world's most eligible bachelors just took himself off the market.  Prince Harry is engaged to American actress Meghan Markle, Kensington Palace announced in a statement Monday.  “His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince Harry to Ms. Meghan Markle,” according to the palace statement. The couple got engaged earlier this month in London. Prince Harry also ""sought and received the blessing of Ms. Markle's parents,"" the palace said.  Several hours later, the couple appeared hand-in-hand for a brief photo opportunity in the gardens of Kensington Palace, where a beaming prince said he realized Markle was the one for him ""the first time we met.""  The couple plan to get married next May at St. George’s Chapel inside Windsor Castle. They will live in Nottingham Cottage, Harry's apartment at Kensington Palace.  Markle is a 36-year-old California native emerged from relative obscurity after news began to leak in the fall of 2016 that she was dating Prince Harry, 33.  The couple dated for more than a year before making their first official appearance together this past September at the Invictus Games in Toronto.  The newly betrothed couple, during their first public appearance together on Sept. 25, 2017, at the Invictus Games in Toronto, Canada. Chris Jackson / Getty Images  The pair met in early July 2016 after being set up on a blind date set up by a mutual friend, the couple told the BBC in a joint interview. The prince had never heard of the actress, who in turn knew only superficially about the royal.  The happy couple, at a photo call with reporters Monday after news broke about their engagement. Chris Jackson / Getty Images  The couple kept quiet about their relationship until Prince Harry issued a rare statement last November scolding paparazzi for endangering the safety of his girlfriend and blasting coverage he found racist and sexist.  But even after that announcement, the couple did not make any public appearances together until this past May when the two appeared at a polo match benefiting two of Prince Harry’s charities. Markle cheered on Harry as he played, but the two did not arrive or leave the event together.  Shutterstock / MEGA  For the September opening ceremony for this year's Invictus Games, the two originally sat several rows apart, but the couple stepped out publicly for the first time just days later, when they arrived, holding hands, for a wheelchair tennis match. They were seen laughing and being affectionate with each other throughout the event.  Prince Harry proposed to Markle in early November, while the couple enjoyed a “cozy” night in at his Kensington Palace apartment, where the two were roasting a chicken.  “It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee,” Markle said in a BBC interview following the announcement of their engagement.  The impending nuptials will be the biggest royal wedding since Harry's older brother, Prince William, married the former Kate Middleton on April 29, 2011.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said in a statement they were “very excited for Harry and Meghan.”  “It has been wonderful getting to know Meghan and see how happy she and Harry are together,” they said.  Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, also issued congratulations through Twitter.  ""The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh are delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement.  Prince Harry proposed to Markle with an engagement ring he designed with a center diamond from Botswana, where the two visited on vacation shortly after they met, and two outside diamonds from the personal collection of the Harry’s mother, the late Princess Diana.  It also will be the first time an American has married a British royal since King Edward VIII abdicated the throne in December 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced socialite. Like Simpson, Markle also is a divorcee. She was previously married to American film producer Trevor Engelson for nearly two years, divorcing in 2013.  In May, Prince Harry brought Markle as his date to the wedding reception of Kate's younger sister, Pippa Middleton. Royal watchers believe their attendance signaled how serious the relationship had become since it marked the first time Markle had mingled at a large gathering of royal family members.  Prince Harry is the fifth in line to the throne, behind the two children of his brother, Prince William, who is second in the line of succession behind their father. He will be bumped to sixth in line following the birth of William's third child next year.  Before he began dating Markle, the prince's romantic life had been calm and quiet for the past several years after a string of high-profile relationships. His most recent serious relationship, with model Cressida Bonas, ended in 2014 after two years together.  Follow Eun Kyung Kim on Twitter or Facebook."

Chris kept stepping back to let her have the spotlight and wouldn’t take photos but kept watching her when she would pose,” the eyewitness stated. “They were together the entire time and kept walking with his hand around her waist.”  Aww… Can we smell love in the air?  Furthermore, it looks like their buddies also encouraged them to interact and were there to make sure everybody was having fun.  “Troian was so cute. She kept pushing Sofia to do photos and checking in on her,” the insider shared. “You can tell they were all really good friends and having a great double date.”  We should mention first before the speculations go out of control, that Chris and Sofia have been great friends for a while but indeed, their relationship has always had the potential for more.

"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Michael Jackson's life is being made into a new stage musical  A new musical based on the life of Michael Jackson is set for a run on Broadway in 2020.  The show, which currently has no title, is being written by Pulitzer Prize winner Lynn Nottage.  The Michael Jackson Estate and Columbia Live Stage company announced the news on Tuesday, but didn't say which theatre the show will play in.  The musical will encompass many of Jackson's greatest hits, including Thriller, Beat It and Smooth Criminal.  Christopher Wheeldon will direct and choreograph the show, which is likely to contain some of the recognisable dances moves from Jackson's music videos and tours.  Wheeldon won a Tony Award for best choreography in 2015 for his work on An American in Paris.  It is not known what role the Michael Jackson estate has in creating the show and whether the more controversial talking points from the star's life, such as his 2005 trial and acquittal over claims of sexual abuse, will be featured in the dramatisation.  This won't be the first time that Jackson's music has been featured in a stage production - Thriller Live opened in London's West End in January 2009.

"According to TMZ, Chris Brown is the father of a 9-month-old girl born of his secret union with a model named Nia! The child would have been conceived in September 2013. At that time, the love life of the rapper was difficult to follow, once Rihanna, once Karrueche … But finally the singer of “Loyal” has his heart set on the 26 years old model…  If ever since the couple leads a complicated relationship between the “Love you, love you nots” and Chris troubles with the justice, Karrueche has always supported her bad boy, saying she was ready to marry him even though he went to prison. But faced with this surprising news, the young woman decided to officially stop this tormented relationship through her Twitter account:  “Listen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family. No baby drama for me.”  Apparently unaware of the existence of this child, Karrueche was also taken for a fool. In fact, the child’s mother is not a stranger to her.  TMZ found a picture where we can see Karrueche posing with her arm around Nia‘s neck at a party in Las Vegas. One of her best friends, Christina Milian, was also here and so was Breezy who has not been a very good boy that day. The pictures were taken in May 2013 a few months before Nia was pregnant.  If the singer has still not commented on the topic, a source close to him declares that “he is happy to be a dad” and that “he wants to be present in the life of his daughter!”  Rihanna shocked by the news is convinced that he will fulfill his father’s job. If she has read the article several times before digesting the news, she thinks “ Chris will be a good father and take care of his little girl. That’s a big responsibility and something that requires a lot of work, energy and love. She wishes him all the best in this new and very important chapter in his life”, said a source to Hollywood Life.  Do you think Chris Brown will be a good father?"
"Postby Guest » Wed May 02, 2018 1:05 pm  By Andrew Shuster | 3:29 pm, May 1, 2018    A tabloid report claiming Brad Pitt is seeking advice from George Clooney on his supposed romance with Neri Oxman is completely made-up. As Gossip Cop has repeatedly stressed, the movie star isn’t dating the MIT professor, so this entire story is based on a lie.    According to Woman’s Day, Pitt is inspired by Clooney’s marriage to wife Amal, a human rights lawyer who works completely outside of Hollywood. Oxman is an architecture professor who also has no ties to the movie industry, so Pitt supposedly asked his friend how to keep her interested once his star power wears off.    As the story goes, Clooney would rather tease his friend than offer him guidance. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “George loves that Brad has been thrown off his game and makes fun of him endlessly. It’s sweet payback for all the jokes Brad tossed his way after George started dating Amal.”    The outlet’s questionable insider goes on to say that although Clooney has been messing with Pitt, Amal has actually been “advising Neri on ways to keep calm and grounded amid the media circus.” The seemingly nonexistent tipster further contends that Pitt “is very grateful” for Amal because “he’s not used to having a non-famous girlfriend and Neri never expected to be in the limelight.”    The tabloid’s article, however, is nothing more than fan fiction. Pitt’s rep has told us on the record several times that the actor isn’t dating Oxman. This has been backed up by trusted publications such as People, which recently noted Pitt and Oxman have a “professional friendship,” as while as E! News, which similarly reported that Pitt and Oxman are “strictly friends.”    This article only seems to exist because Woman’s Day came up with a way to drag Clooney into his pal’s imaginary romance. In addition to the fact that Pitt and Oxman aren’t a couple, a mutual pal of ours and Clooney tells us on background that the actor’s friend hasn’t turned to him for advice about dating the MIT professor. This is just a fabricated story based on a phony premise.    It’s worth noting, this isn’t the first time Gossip Cop has had to debunk a bogus story about Clooney supposedly playing a role in his friend’s love life. We recently busted New Idea for making up a story about Clooney getting Pitt and Jennifer Aniston back together. This latest article involving Oxman is equally untrue."
"Eminem Escapes From An Asylum In Twisted Visual For ""Framed""  Marshall debuts the long awaited video from his 'Revival' album.  After teasing fans with a short trailer last week, Eminem returned on Tuesday (April 3) to unveil the full version of the twisted visual for his horror-themed Revival cut ""Framed.""  At the beginning of the visual, a news reporter named Stan Dresden informs viewers that Eminem has escaped an asylum. While Em is watching the report from his living room, the news team and detectives are camped outside out his home waiting to make a move. Em takes on the role of a psychotic serial killer with multiple personalities (Slim Shady, Marshall Mathers, Eminem, etc.) who believes he's being framed for a string of murders because he has no recollection of all the wrongdoings his alter ego Slim Shady has done.  The rapper's multiple personalities are seen throughout the visual, which is set in places like a dark woods, asylum hallway and a blood-splattered living room where Em is accompanied by two dead bodies and multiple drawings. Despite repeatedly declaring his innocence, Em is finally caught as a detective enters his home to talk to him about his recent killing sprees. The detective calms the rapper down by using hypnosis and in the closing scene, Em is back in an asylum and begins to hallucinate before he's injected with an unknown substance and taken away.  The ""Framed"" visual follows Eminem's previously released videos for Revival tracks ""River"" featuring Ed Sheeran and the Beyonce-assisted ""Walk On Water.""  Watch the visual for ""Framed"" below.  This story was originally posted to Billboard."

"Twihards are having a hard time containing their delight because, as improbable as it sounds, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were spotted hanging out together at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles Saturday night.  And six years after their three-year relationship came crashing down over reports that Stewart was cheating on Pattinson with married director Rupert Sanders, rumors have been swirling that the two are considering a reconciliation.  CLICK HERE if you are having trouble viewing the photo gallery on your mobile device.  This is all according to the Daily Mail, which published grainy photos of Stewart and Pattinson, looking like they were having a chill time together, hanging out by a car outside a party at Chateau Marmont for Lily-Rose Depp.  Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart – OUTSIDE OF THE CHATEAU MARMONT, LA 06/02/2018 pic.twitter.com/yozZSAGSIw — Elishia (@multifandomacc5) June 3, 2018  Stewart, 28, was wearing a black ensemble and appeared to be smoking, while Pattinson, 32, was wearing jeans, a graphic T-shrirt and black cap.  The idea of the “Twilight’s” Bella and Edward reconciling romantically in real life seems improbable because of the high-profile humiliation Pattinson likely suffered when Stewart was caught in a cheating scandal.  She was photographed in an intimate embrace with Sanders, her director for “Snow White and the Huntsman,” who was 19 years her senior. She and Sanders issued a very public apology to Pattinson.  When the Twilight series ended in 2012, Stewart and Pattinson seemed to go their separate ways both professionally and romantically.  Each has earned critical praise and International awards consideration for leaving blockbuster fare behind and starring in smaller, indie films. Meanwhile, Stewart came out as bisexual and began seriously dating model Stella Maxwell in late 2016, while Pattinson became engaged to U.K. singer FKA Twigs.  But Pattinson’s engagement to Twigs reportedly ended in October, while the Daily Mail, citing a report in OK! magazine, said “there’s trouble in paradise,” with regards to Stewart and Maxwell’s relationship.  In April, the Twilight stars were reported to have “gotten together a few times over the past several weeks,” according to OK!  “They’re trying to keep it low-key, but there’s still chemistry there,” a source told OK! “People in their circles are starting to wonder if they’re considering a reconciliation.”  Supposedly, Stewart hopes Pattinson is “serious” about having forgiven her, an insider told OK!

"Actor Ving Rhames says that police officers once held him at gunpoint in his own home in Santa Monica, California, after neighbors reported that a “large black man” had broken in.  The “Mission: Impossible” star recounted the event during a Friday interview on the Clay Cane show on Sirius XM. Rhames was responding to a question about how racism had affected his life.  Rhames said it was about 2:15 in the afternoon when he heard a knock on the front door.  “I open the door and there is a red dot pointed at my face from a 9 millimeter,” he said. “They say, ‘Put up your hands,’ literally.”  According to Rhames, he was confronted by three police officers, the captain of police and a police dog. The situation de-escalated after the captain recognized Rhames from their sons’ playing sports together and apologized. He said police told him they were responding to a 911 call from a woman who “said a large black man was breaking into the house.”  Ian Lawrence via Getty Images Ving Rhames filming scenes for ""Mission Impossible 6"" in London.  When Rhames and police questioned the woman who had allegedly made the report ― she lived across the street ― she denied ever calling, the actor said.  “Here I am in my own home, alone in some basketball shorts just because someone called and said a large black man is breaking in,” Rhames said. “When I opened up the wooden door, a 9 millimeter is pointed at me. My problem is ... what if it was my son and he had a video game remote or something, and you thought it was a gun?”  The Santa Monica Police Department released a public statement about the incident on Saturday. The statement said police received “several calls” from neighbors reporting that a “black male was seen entering a residence and did not live there.”  “As officers were assessing the residence, they encountered the resident at the front door,” the statement reads. “Officers recognized the resident and the situation was quickly de-escalated with no use of force occurring.”  While Rhames said the event happened this year, the press release describes it as occurring in July 2016. The statement adds that after the incident, the department launched a “Meet Your Neighbors” community initiative to encourage neighbors to get to know one another and “address situations such as these.”"
"YouTube singer Austin Jones was returning to the U.S. following a concert in Poland on Monday when he was taken into custody at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport. The 24-year-old was arrested on two counts of production of child pornography. If convicted, he could land in prison for a minimum of 15 years.  According to the Chicago Sun Times, Jones will remain in federal custody until his court hearing Wednesday because prosecutors say he is a “risk to the community and there’s a danger he’ll flee.”  Court documents state that Jones was allegedly in communication with two underage female victims via Facebook in August 2016 and May 2017, and in both interactions, had asked the 14- and 15-year-old victims to “prove” to him that they were his biggest fans by sending him sexually explicit videos.  In the criminal complaint, one girl admitted that she made 15 videos for Jones as recently as May 4th, in what she called an “audition.” She alleged that the YouTube star pressured her to “work really hard” even though she told him she “might pass out” and was tired from what he was asking her to do. At one point during the Facebook interactions, the victim allegedly acknowledged that Jones was 24, and he requested that she repeatedly acknowledge that she was “only 14.”  Jones’ other alleged victim, whom he chatted with in August 2016, alleged that the singer told her she would get to perform a sex act on him if she were “lucky.” In the chat, Jones allegedly acknowledged that he was 23 at the time and the victim was 14. Federal authorities said the girl sent Jones a total of 25 videos, including eight that were sexually explicit.  According to the complaint, once arrested Monday, Jones admitted to “receiving videos from the victims, and he admitted it was for sexual pleasure.”  Jones, who is best known for his own renditions of popular songs by artists like Justin Bieber, Twenty One Pilots and Fall Out Boy, has a following of more than 500,000 subscribers on his YouTube page and more than 300,000 followers on Instagram.  The singer came under fire in 2015 over allegations that he had lied about his age in order to solicit “twerking” videos from underage girls, which lead to a lengthy Facebook apology and an emotional YouTube confessional.  “I’m embarrassed. I’d have conversations online with girls that would involve me asking them to create a video of themselves twerking,” he wrote at the time in a since-deleted Facebook post. “Sometimes I’d make videos of myself doing some twerk moves in return. Here’s the truth: I NEVER asked them to do anything more than send a twerking video. Nothing EVER went beyond that.”"

"Brad Pitt‘s family – particularly his mom Jane – is thrilled he’s back in touch with Jennifer Aniston following her split from Justin Theroux, according to RadarOnline.com.  “This is what she’s dreamed of for over a decade — she never lost faith and has stayed in touch with Jen for years,” says a source.  What’s more — the informant reveals both Aniston and Jane “are both pretty old school and write long letters to each other a couple of times a month.” Plus, they talk on the phone regularly and never miss a birthday or anniversary.  “Jane and the whole Missouri-based Pitt family haven’t been disrespectful about Jen and Justin’s marriage, but once it became apparent things wouldn’t work out they actively pushed Brad to get back in touch” dishes the snitch. “Now they’re determined to see them back together for a second chance.”  As fans know, Pitt famously left wife Aniston for Angelina Jolie. They later wed but also split up.  But Aniston reportedly leaned on her ex-husband Brad over the course of 15 months as her ­marriage to Justin Theroux crumbled.  Aniston and Theroux announced their breakup on Feb. 15, 2018 after only two-and-a-half years of marriage.  The announcement read, in part, “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year.  “We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship….Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”  Radar told you first that Aniston and Theroux were breaking up and detailed their many issues."

"When it emerged he had signed on to star in a prequel to Jason Statham's Transporter series many assumed he had turned his back Game Of Thrones.  But Ed Skrein has finally spoken out to say he would never have walked away from the plum role of Daario Naharis, and instead insisted 'politics' was behind his abrupt exit from the show.  The 32-year-old English actor gave a love it or loath it performance as the cocksure lieutenant of mercenary group the Second Sons, who ends up killing his fellow commanders to win the affection of Daenerys Targaryen, that still lives in the memory of fans.  Scroll down for video  Politicking: Ed Skrein has insisted he left his plum role on Game Of Thrones due to behind the scenes intrigue  He told TooFab: 'Contrary to reports I didn’t walk away. I wouldn’t walk away. There are very few things in my life I’ve walked away from.  'This is a complicated industry and there’s always politics involved.'  However while he still seems disappointed about having to have left such a plum role after just three episodes, he insists he does not wonder about how things could have been different.  The rapper-turned-actor said: 'I never really look back, my journey has been unorthodox in many ways.  Un-Ed-iftying: After he lost his role as Daario Naharis it was given to the bland Dutch actor Michiel Huisman  'All I do is count my blessings and try to be as present as I can and I’m thankful for every step of this journey.'  Wise words indeed from the jolly cockney, who went by the rather questionable moniker of The Dinnerlady P.I.M.P. during his hip hop career.  While Ed's role was filled by the bland Michiel Huisman, Ed finds himself filling someone's shoes himself in Transporter Refueled, which hits screens on Friday.  The statuesque actor plays a younger version of dinky star Jason Statham's hardman chauffeur Frank Martin in the film, which sees the character face-off against some Eastern European gangsters.  Bald ambition: He is filling the shoes of follicly challenged action icon Jason Statham in Transporter Refueled  However he insists he felt no pressure taking over from the follicly challenged action icon, saying: 'It wasn't really daunting it all The daunting part for me, the pressure was from the inside.  'I want to make work that I’m proud of and that fulfills me creatively, that’s where the pressure came from.'  While it is unlikely his hairier rendition of the action character is unlikely to garner much critical acclaim, he stands a greater chance of winning some attention when he plays the villain Ajax in hotly-tipped 20th Century Fox Marvel spinoff Deadpool.  He said he had a great time getting physical with the film's star Ryan Reynolds, who plays the titular fast-talking mercenary character with a sick sense of humour.  Original and best: It is unlikely Ed will win over fans of Jason's popular portrayal of the hardman chauffeur  Ed said: 'Me and Ryan had incredible chemistry, we had this synergy. A lot of time, they don’t want to pair actors together, especially leads because we’re not stunt guys.  'We may make a mistake and if we make a mistake and break each others’ noses or knock a tooth out. It's a lot of money and jobs on the line.  I was like to (the director), ""Get me in there, put me in, I’ve done all this training, I’m ready.  'They were hesitant [but] I went straight in and we had a great synergy and we stayed the two of us for the whole day and I remember Ryan saying to me, ""I’ve had such a great time getting beat up by you,"" and vice versa.'"

"Kim Kardashian West hopped onto Snapchat to defend her husband Kanye West's honor tonight, posting a series of videos that prove Taylor Swift gave West permission to rap about her on infamous The Life of Pablo single ""Famous."" (The line in question: ""For all my Southside niggas that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / I made that bitch famous."") Kardashian teased the reveal on Twitter earlier in the evening, and West's feud with Swift was the basis for one of the major plotlines on tonight's episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  In the footage posted on Snapchat, West asks Swift for permission to use a version of the line over the phone from his studio. She gives her consent and thanks him for bringing the line to her before recording and releasing it. It's still unclear just how much Swift knew about the ultimate phrasing of the line, but it's obvious she agrees its sentiment is acceptable. (If you'd rather read than watch, The Fader has transcribed the footage. You'll miss legendary producer Rick Rubin hanging out on a couch in the background, though.)  Here is the entire conversation Taylor & Kanye had, judge for yourself. pic.twitter.com/InTjvPGKe3 — ShadyPopMusic (@ShadyPopMusic) July 18, 2016  At the beginning of this year, Swift and West had almost entirely reconciled after he famously interrupted her at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. That all changed when West released ""Famous"" and the rest of The Life of Pablo in February. Swift sent out a statement condemning the line and West's misogyny a few days after it was first played in public, and West used a series of tweets to claim that Swift had approved the line well before it was released. When she won the Grammy for Album of the Year a few days later, she used her speech to allude to unnamed enemies who ""will try to undercut your success."" It was widely assumed she meant West.  When Kardashian appeared on the cover of GQ last month, she confirmed that Swift had approved the line and suggested that her conversation with West had been caught on camera, only to get blocked by Swift's legal team once they learned about its existence. It seems like the existence of a letter from Swift's attorney couldn't keep Kardashian silent forever, and now we're left to wait and see how Swift reacts to having the rug pulled out from under her. Between this and the Nils Sjoberg fiasco, she's had a pretty rough week.  Update July 18th, 12:20AM ET: Taylor Swift has responded to Kim Kardashian West's Snapchat with her own posts on Instagram and Twitter. The picture — a block of text claiming that West never played her the song or said he would call her ""that bitch"" — was captioned with ""That moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet."" Swift says that the video falsely paints her as a liar, when she wasn't actually played the song, making Kim and Kanye's actions ""character assassination.""  That moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet. A photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Jul 17, 2016 at 9:14pm PDT  Why People Love Bass"

"Twice the fun! Kym Johnson and Robert Herjavec were thrown a lavish baby shower on Saturday, March 31, where they also revealed the gender of their twins!  The Shark Tank star, 55, and Johnson shared the exciting news — that they are expecting a baby boy and a baby girl — by popping two big black balloons that held smaller pink and blue balloons and confetti. The sweet moment was captured by one of their guests, BP Major, who wrote, “Genders are revealed!!!! So excited. Congratulations to @robert_herjavec and @kymherjavec5678 – love you both” with dancing man emojis. Other guests in attendance included the Dancing With the Stars alum’s friends and costars, Cheryl Burke and Anna Trebunskaya.  The host of the party, Carson Kressley, shared a sweet photo with Johnson that he hilariously captioned, “One of us is pregnant!” The Queer Eye for the Straight Guy alum, who was once a contestant on DWTS, decorated the party with pretty displays of pink and blue hydrangeas. Guests were treated to an impressive layout of pastries that were also surrounded by blue and pink details.  As previously reported, Johnson and Herjavec, who met when they were paired together on season 20 of the ABC series and married in 2016, announced they were expecting in December 2017. Throughout her pregnancy, the professional dancer, 41, has been documenting her journey by sharing photos of her baby bump on her social media accounts.  This was not the only party thrown in honor of the couple. In January, Herjavec threw his wife a baby shower in her native Australia, where she celebrated with family and friends.

"Arya Stark had it right.  HBO announced on Tuesday (via the teaser of recycled footage below) that Game of Thrones‘ eighth and final season will arrive in April of 2019 — just as cast member Maisie Williams said in an interview wayyy back in January.  Previously, the only official time frame came from HBO chief Casey Bloys, who this summer narrowed it down to the “first half” of 2019. Every season of Game of Thrones has gotten underway in April, except for Season 3 (which started on March 31) and Season 7 (which premiered July 16).  Thrones‘ Season 7 finale aired August 27, 2017.  Back in January, Bloys told TVLine that showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff — and not the network — were responsible for the delayed start of Season 8. “It was based on when they felt that they could deliver a show that the are most proud of… I suppose we could’ve said to them, ‘You must deliver by this date… But we’ve worked with them a long time and I trust them to tell us, ‘This is the time we need to make it good.’ So I don’t know that it’s a delay as much as it is ‘This is the time required to deliver at the level that they think the fans expect.’”  Every battle.

"Netflix will premiere “13 Reasons Why” Season 2, the next chapter in its controversial hit teen-suicide drama, on May 18.  The streamer announced the premiere date on social media, with the caption, “The tapes were just the beginning.” That came after it teased the reveal in posts earlier Monday saying “The truth is developing” and a live-stream showing two Polaroid photos — leaving fans on tenterhooks for several hours.  Netflix announced the renewal of “13 Reasons” last May, after the freshman season debuted in March 2017 and quickly captured widespread buzz.  The first season of the series, based on Jay Asher’s young-adult book by the same name, centers around the death a high-school girl, Hannah, played by Katherine Langford, who has left behind a series of 13 cassette tapes for her friend and crush Clay (Dylan Minnette) explaining what led her to suicide. The show also stars Christian Navarro, Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Miles Heizer, Brian d’Arcy James, and Kate Walsh.  Season 2 picks up in the aftermath of Hannah’s death, as the other characters start their journeys toward healing and recovery. In the upcoming season, Hannah’s parents file a lawsuit against Liberty High School. But, according to Netflix, “A series of ominous Polaroids lead Clay and his classmates to uncover a sickening secret and a conspiracy to cover it up.”  “13 Reasons Why” season 2 is being produced for Netflix by Paramount Television. The show is also executive produced by Selena Gomez, along with Mandy Teefey, Kristel Laiblin, Joy Gorman Wettels, Michael Sugar and Steve Golin.  Related Top TV Salaries Revealed Why Sandra Bullock's Children Liked Her Better While She Was Shooting 'Bird Box'  The first season of the show stimulated discussions about teen suicide — and controversy. After its release Netflix added more viewer warnings to “13 Reasons Why,” which is rated TV-MA, and included links to suicide-prevention resources in the documentary the accompanies the series. It ranked as the fourth most-tweeted-about TV show of 2017 (after “Game of Thrones,” “Stranger Things” and “Big Brother”).  Netflix said season 2 of “13 Reasons Why” will carry a new warning video in front of each episode telling viewers about how to get help and pointing them to resources on the website 13reasonswhy.info. It also plans an after-show, “Beyond the Reasons,” with the show’s actors, experts, and educators breaking down the series.  The season 2 announcement trailer features Depeche Mode’s 1993 single “I Feel You”:"

"The premium cable network has also announced that season four will bow in November.  No surprise here: Starz has extended Outlander for two additional seasons.  The premium cable network on Wednesday announced that it has renewed the Ron Moore drama based on Diana Gabaldon's best-selling book series for seasons five and six. Starz also revealed that the 13-episode fourth season of the time-traveling period soap will return in November. (A specific return date has yet to be announced.)  All told, the renewal is for 24 total episodes, with each season consisting of 12 episodes. That is Outlander's lowest per-season total after the freshman run consisted of 16 and seasons two and three were 13 apiece. From Sony Pictures Television and starring Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan, Outlander's seasons five and six will be based on material from the fifth and sixth books in Gabaldon's series, The Fiery Cross and A Breath of Snow and Ashes.  ""Fans can rest assured their beloved Claire and Jamie will be back facing new challenges, adversaries and adventures in seasons five and six as we delve into American history and continue the story of the Frasers as they settle in the New World,” Starz CEO Chris Albrecht said in a statement.  Season four is currently in production in Scotland and will consist of 13 episodes following Drums of Autumn, Gabaldon's fourth of eight books in the Outlander series. Season three averaged 5.8 million total viewers cross multiple platforms and ranks as the second-most-watched premium scripted series among women — behind only HBO's Game of Thrones.  In addition to Sony TV, Outlander is produced by Tall Ship Productions, Story Mining & Supply Co. and Left Bank Pictures. The drama is executive produced by Moore, Maril Davis, Toni Graphia, Matthew B. Roberts and Andy Harries.  Outlander joins a scripted roster at Starz that also includes Counterpart, Howard's End, The Rook, Vida, Sweetbitter and Power, among others."
"(Warning: This post contains spoilers for the midseason finale of “This Is Us” Season 3, which aired Tuesday.)  While offering up an overload of emotional information to Pearson family fans Tuesday, the midseason finale of “This Is Us” Season 3, called “The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning,” finally gave us the answer to the question viewers have been asking since the second season finale’s shocking flash-forward ending aired last spring: who the “her” is that Future Randall and Future Tess are preparing to visit.  The answer: Randall’s mother, Rebecca Pearson (played by Mandy Moore).  Yes, just as “This Is Us” wrapped up the first half of its third season tonight, it was revealed that decades from now, Randall and his adult daughter — along with Toby and now Beth — are going to see “Randall’s mother,” as Beth puts it to her employee (apparently she’s running a ballet company now?), who she obtains a Pin the Tail on the Donkey game from, as she prepares to join Randall and daughter on this journey.  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Midseason Finale Reveals Nicky's Fate - And It's Probably Not What You Were Expecting  Though this “her” revelation didn’t come until the episode’s closing moments — which also included a shocking twist about the fate of Jack’s little brother Nicky during the Vietnam War — we were building to it throughout the entire hour of the Dan Fogelman-created series.  The installment included scenes in the present of Rebecca accidentally upsetting young Tess while trying to address her emerging feelings toward other girls, and then relating to her enough so that she felt comfortable addressing them with her parents. The episode also ended with a fight between our Present Day Beth and Randall, because Randall refused to drop out of the city council race, when the polls show he won’t win and his wife asks him to give up and come back to helping his family.  That spat led to Randall sleeping on the couch, and a not so happy vibe between the happy couple in the present, with some hints in the future indicating the two are only communicating between Adult Tess. Does that mean they separate or even divorce?  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Melanie Liburd Is 'Really Excited' for Beth-Centric Episode - and What It Means for Zoe's Backstory (Video)  Because fans now have to wait until midseason to find out more about the future — and present — TheWrap has rounded up all the facts we’ve previously gathered about “This Is Us”s now-not-so-mysterious character, so you can theorize over the next piece of the puzzle — what are the circumstances surrounding this foreboding reunion? — for the next couple months.  See below for everything we knew — before tonight — about “her.”  Also Read: Hold Up, 'This Is Us' Fans - Mandy Moore Says You Might Actually Like That Guy With the Flowers  She’s close to Tess, Randall and Toby  In the third season premiere, the final scene gives a few more clues as to who the unnamed woman might be. Tess and Randall arrive at some sort of facility, and while Tess goes to the bathroom, Randall gives Toby (Chris Sullivan) a call, and asks if he’s “coming down.” Toby says he doesn’t know, but Randall tells him the “she” would want him here, and Toby agrees that he probably should. We see Toby talking to Randall on the phone from a bed — alone — which made us wonder if perhaps the mystery woman could be his wife Kate (Chrissy Metz), or someone close to Kate, and Kate might be dead. Yikes!  “You thought we made it sound like he was talking about Kate — I would say that’s open to interpretation,” co-showrunner Isaac Aptaker told TheWrap at the show’s Season 3 finally in September.  Alright, now we know it’s not Kate, but “Randall’s mother” — a person that is apparently close to Randall, Tess and Toby. And Sterling K. Brown told us that would be the case in the end, because anyone close to the Pearsons is close to Toby.  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Sterling K Brown Tells Us All About the Beth-Centric Episode You've Been Waiting For  “Toby is part of our family now,” Brown said. “So anybody who Randall cares about, Tobias would obviously care about as well. That’s my brother.”  Tess hasn’t seen “her” in awhile  Back on the Season 2 finale, we got our first glimpse of an older Randall and an older Tess. “It’s time to go see her, Tess,” Randall says. Tess responds that she’s “not ready,” and Randall says he’s not either.  The scene is cut in a way that makes us think Beth might be dying (but that was ruled out by Susan Kelechi Watson herself) or maybe something is going on with Deja, who in the Season 3 premiere agreed to let the Pearsons adopt her after her mother relinquished her paternal rights.  Brown also told TheWrap that there’s a specific reason he needs to coax Tess to see “her” — which of course we’ll find out in due time.  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3 Premiere: Showrunners Break Down Jack and Rebecca's Awful First Date  “There’s a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular,” Brown said. “Yes, there’s a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular, because Tess hadn’t seen the ‘her’ for some time. And so there’s a reason why it’s time to go and she’s like, ‘I can’t.’ There’s a reason. Other people may have been more easily galvanized, but Tess needed a little more coaxing.”  This is as far in the future as we’ll go  “This future timeline is sort of the furthest that we’ll go in these characters lives and where our series will wrap up,” Aptaker told TheWrap in September, backing up something Fogelman has previously talked about.  “I don’t imagine us going past this time period in the future so in terms of a timeline, this is our ending timeline,” Fogelman said in an interview with EW after the Season 2 finale last spring. “But we may have other past timelines we’re going to introduce in the course of the series, and also other future story lines that we might introduce as well.”  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Mandy Moore Hints Season 3 Premiere Reveals More About Randall's 'Her'  “Well we’re going to give answers in that timeline, but it doesn’t mean it’s a timeline we can’t revisit and sort of push the story forward in that timeline,” co-showrunner Elizabeth Berger told TheWrap. “We’re going to give a lot of satisfying answers regarding that timeline this season — so they’re quickly in store.”  Answers were promised to be coming soon  “I think the plan is that, in the course of the season, you will get a lot of answers,” Fogelman said, during a panel after the LA premiere in September. “The story is not about where it ends up, it’s about how you kind of get there… we’re not going to string it out over seven seasons or anything.”  Moore said Fogelman has, “talked a lot about figuring out who [Randall] is talking about.”  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3: Milo Ventimiglia Hints Jack's Little Brother Nicky Has Some Real Issues  “I think that every episode is offering a more fully realized picture of who that is,” Moore said in an interview with EW earlier this month. “It’s not being dragged for the sake of being cheeky. I think it’s just really brilliant storytelling and, Dan’s old favorite way of describing the show is the mixed up videotapes of home videos. This is exactly that, but we’re leaning a little bit into the future aspect of it.”  Brown previously told EW that we do in fact know this character already.  “It is someone that we have met over the first two seasons, so it won’t be something that comes out of nowhere,” Brown said. “Dan has already spoken to the fact that we’ve already shot parts of how he wants the series to end that’s dealing with that particular ‘her’ as well. I think by about midseason, maybe episode 9 or so, the audience will know who that individual is.”  “This Is Us” Season 3 will return Jan. 15 on NBC."

"UPDATED: Musicians mourned the loss of rock icon Tom Petty with an outpouring of tributes on social media.  The Gainesville, Fla., native suffered a heart attack Sunday at his home in Malibu, Calif. He was transferred to UCLA Medical Center-Santa Monica, where he was on life support until he died Monday evening at age 66.  Although Petty’s actual time of death was 8:40 p.m. PT on Monday, several media outlets reported that Petty had died earlier in the day, leading to a premature wave of statements and tributes. At his time of death, Petty was “surrounded by family, his bandmates, and friends,” according to Tony Dimitriades, the longtime manager of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  “It’s shocking, crushing news,” Bob Dylan said in a statement. “I thought the world of Tom. He was a great performer, full of the light, a friend, and I’ll never forget him.”  Longtime friend and collaborator Jeff Lynne said simply: “Tom Petty was the coolest guy I ever knew.”  “This is unbearable,” Sheryl Crow wrote on Twitter. “Vegas and now a great music hero has passed.

We will miss you.”  Related Tom Petty's Bandmates Tell Stories Behind Lost Tracks at 'American Treasure' Preview Event When a Music Legend Dies, How Does Today’s Mostly Automated Radio React?

"Mark Burnett and Roma Downey‘s son is on the mend following his hospitalization.  Last week, the Touched by an Angel actress, 57, shared a series of Instagram posts that revealed her 20-year-old stepson, Cameron Burnett, had been hospitalized.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Cameron is Mark’s son from the reality TV producer’s previous marriage to Dianne J. Burnett, with whom he also shares son James. Mark and Downey married in 2007 at their Malibu home.  In an exclusive statement to PEOPLE provided by a Burnett family spokesperson, the couple said Monday, “Our family is so thankful for all the prayers over the last few days. We are relieved to have Cameron back home with us and we are so incredibly grateful for the amazing care he received at UCLA.”  Cameron’s recent hospitalization comes four years after he underwent brain tumor surgery in 2014. At the time, Pastor Rick Warren tweeted and asked people to pray for the then-teenager following complications from the operation. “PRAY for my friend Cameron Burnett in ICU with serious complications from brain tumor surgery.Cam is Mark Burnett’s son,” Warren tweeted.  PRAY for my friend Cameron Burnett in ICU with serious complications from brain tumor surgery.Cam is Mark Burnett's son. — Rick Warren (@RickWarren) October 14, 2014  Gabriel Olsen/WireImage  Downey first asked for prayer for her stepson’s health on Friday when she wrote on Instagram, “Dear friends, I need your prayers please for someone I love who is ill tonight. Thank you 🙏.”  Cameron’s mother, Dianne, also asked for prayers over the weekend, writing on Instagram, “Thank you God Angels and Spirit guides for watching over my angel. #pray #heal #godspeed 🙏🏻 #believe #familyfirst Life is a precious gift 💙.”  Cameron Burnett Courtesy Burnett Family  She also shared a photo of her sons with Mark on her Instagram Story Sunday, when Cameron was sitting in a hospital bed at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.  On Saturday, Downey thanked her followers “from the bottom of my heart for all your prayers for our son Cameron.”  “You all responded so fast and Mark and I are so appreciative of your kindness and prayer support,” she wrote. “Please keep those prayers coming today so we can get him safely home from hospital and restored to perfect health . Thank you God for making a way . In Jesus name . Amen 🙏🕊”  The actress also gave an update on Sunday, with a brief message, writing, “Thank you for all your prayers for our family , we are so grateful 🙏.”  On Monday, Downey again shared her gratitude on Instagram: “Thanking God for answered prayers for our family and to everyone out there who prayed with us this week THANK YOU . We are so grateful ! We are joyfully saying prayers of thanksgiving 🔆 #answeredprayers #thankyougod#gratefulheart #gratitude #joy #relief#prayer #countingourblessings.”  Early last week, Cameron shared a photo of himself by the seaside at the Horse Guards Parade in London, England. “Always on guard 👑 🇬🇧,” he wrote in the caption.  He was a student at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts and has directed short films such as The Bench. His project received Official Selections at more than 35 film festivals around the world and won at eight of those, according to his website.  Mark shared a photo with his son and his friend on March 17, wearing a big smile as he posed with the duo: “Spot the old guy who’s crashing the young Californians.”  Burnett has executive-produced multiple hit shows such as Shark Tank, The Apprentice, Survivor and The Voice."

"In case you didn’t know, John Stamos (of Full House fame) and his new wife Caitlin McHugh are really, really obsessed with all things Disney.  In fact, the pair, who had been dating for two years, got engaged at Disneyland in October. There, Stamos staged an elaborate engagement event for his then-girlfriend, including a short compilation of their favorite Disney films. It all ended with ""The Little Mermaid"" and the caption “just ask the girl.” Of course, Stamos did. On Instagram McHugh posted, “I kissed the boy and said . . . yes!”  “She loves Disneyland and [at the park], I got on my knee and asked her,” Stamos told PEOPLE of their engagement. “I pulled the ring out. I don’t know how she did it, but she went to hug me and slipped her finger right in it. When the park closed, we ran around the park in our Disney onesies.”  Since that day the two went on to get hitched in a gorgeous ceremony at the Little Brown Church in Studio City, California, then partied the night away at their home.  Now, just a week into their marriage, they are celebrating again at the Happiest Place on Earth.  As McHugh’s Instagram shows, the pair has been spending plenty of time at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. While there they’ve even been spotted wearing matching mouse ears, though hers were a bit more spectacular as they came with a bridal veil.  McHugh shared even more of their journey through the park, where they stopped in at shops to look at tiny baby trinkets since they are expecting their first child this spring.  On his page Stamos shared his own adorable image of the pair as they smooched near the castle joking of their one-week anniversary, “and they said it wouldn’t last.”  While this may be their last trip to the park before the baby’s arrival, odds are their upcoming bundle of joy will be a Disney baby, whether he or she likes it or not."

"Brody Jenner‘s relationship with his father Caitlyn Jenner hasn’t always been an easy one to navigate.  On Wednesday, PEOPLE confirmed Caitlyn will not attend her son’s upcoming wedding to fiancée Kaitlynn Carter.  Caitlyn, 68, “has work commitments that have been set up for months and couldn’t be changed in the end,” a source told PEOPLE.  Nevertheless, the source said “everything is good” between the two, adding that Caitlyn “will be throwing a big party for them when the newlyweds return to town.”  And while there’s no bad blood over the wedding, Brody and Caitlyn haven’t always had such a smooth relationship.  Caitlyn Jenner and Brody Jenner Earl Gibson III/Getty  A Rocky Childhood  Caitlyn has long acknowledged that she was an absent father to her four oldest children Cassandra, Burt, Brandon and Brody.  While the older Jenner children were not regulars on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Brody did open up about his strained relationship with his father on the show in 2013.  (Caitlyn went by Bruce before transitioning in 2015. She now goes by Caitlyn and uses female pronouns.)  “I think Bruce is an incredible human being and I think that Bruce is a great father, he just wasn’t a great father to me,” he said.  Brody said Caitlyn and his mother Linda Thompson had a “messy divorce” when he was young, which created tension in the family.  “I grew up with my stepdad,” said Brody, referring to David Foster. “Bruce was never around. I can’t tell you how many birthdays went by where Bruce wasn’t there. I resent him for that.”  Brody’s strained relationship with Caitlyn also caused a rift in his bond with sisters Kendall and Kylie. A source tells PEOPLE that Brody was “never close” with his step-siblings, Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob Kardashian after Caitlyn married Kris Jenner.  “He didn’t spend a lot of time with his dad when his dad married Kris, so he didn’t see them as much,” the sources says.  And while Brody spent time with Kendall and Kylie when they were younger, they’ve grown apart.  “As much as they love them, they’re not close,” the source adds. “It’s unfortunate.”  Understanding Caitlyn’s Transition  Before transitioning, Caitlyn battled depression and identity issues, which caused her to pull away from her family.  “The big, formative years for them, I was really struggling with those issues [of gender identity],” she said during a 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer in 2015.  Still, she takes full responsibility for not being there for her kids.  “There’s no excuse for not being a good parent, no matter how many problems that you have,” Jenner told ABC in 2017. “No excuse for that.”  And the former Hills star has remained supportive of Caitlyn‘s transition.  “The first thing I thought was just like, ‘It finally makes sense,'” Brody told ABC in 2017.  In fact, Brody said he actually prefers Caitlyn over Bruce.  John M. Heller/Getty Images;  “I’ve known Bruce for a long time and I didn’t really get along with Bruce,” he said. “Caitlyn and I get along a little more, because Caitlyn is actually who she really is and she’s living her life finally now as the person she actually was.”  Brody said he was able to start fresh with Caitlyn and let go of his resentment toward his father.  “It’s like getting to know somebody – your dad – all over again, in a better way.”  Brody’s siblings have expressed similar sentiments about their father’s transition.  “In seeing him come out to me and explain his true self, I was more proud right then to carry the last name Jenner, to be a part of the family, than at any time before,” said Brandon.  Rebuilding a Relationship  Both Brody and Caitlyn have been making more of an effort to spend time together in recent years.  In 2016, Caitlyn spent Thanksgiving with Brody and his siblings.  “Thanksgiving with family is the best. And mine keeps getting bigger,” she wrote. “I hope you all had a wonderful day with your families!”  In April, Caitlyn celebrated her future daughter-in-law at her bridal shower at the Santa Anita Park racetrack in Los Angeles.  “Caitlyn and Linda both love Kaitlynn. They’re so happy for Brody,” a source tells PEOPLE. “Brody and Kaitlynn are just trying to focus on the positive and who is there to support them.”  Caitlyn shared a photo from the bridal shower, writing how happy she was to attend.  “Went to my first bridal shower,” Caitlyn captioned a photo of her and Carter, 29. “I had so much fun! PS so much better than Bachelor parties!”  “I’m so happy you were there!!!” Carter commented on the post. “It meant a lot to me!!”"
"Alex Rodriguez only had kind words for his girlfriend Jennifer Lopez on her 49th birthday Tuesday.  “When we were kids, birthdays were exciting because it was all about the gifts we would be getting,” Rodriguez captioned an Instagram gallery of images. “A new bat, dance shoes, maybe a new CD (yes I’m old!).”  The 42-year-old continued, “I see firsthand how that’s changed for Jennifer, and how she’s found joy in sharing with others. For someone who has been about giving everything she has 365 days a year—to our children, our families, the world—I hope today, we can give you all the happiness you deserve. I love you mucho Macha 13.”  KARLIE KLOSS AND JOSH KUSHNER ARE ENGAGED  Several solo shots of Lopez were included in the mix, as was a photo of a neon sign.  Rodriguez later followed up that post with another gallery, captioned “Birthday girl 🎉.”  The gallery included several shots of the famous duo together, including an image of them on bicycles.  MILA KUNIS SAYS SHE WAS TO BLAME FOR 'HORRIBLE' MACAULAY CULKIN BREAKUP: 'I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT IT'  Birthday girl 🎉 A post shared by Alex Rodriguez (@arod) on Jul 24, 2018 at 12:21pm PDT  The A-list couple, Lopez’s twin children and Rodriguez’s two young daughters were all in the Bahamas together on Tuesday, People reports.  Lopez has said she's ""blessed"" to be with Rodriguez. Between work, family and their relationship, the star doesn't have any complaints — though she realizes it's all about balance.  “We have to take our time,"" she told Good Morning America in June. ""I've made plenty of mistakes in my past and [...] we're mature now. We're grown ups, and we're going to take our time and we're going to do things at our own pace."""
"Even by Hollywood standards, she has always been slender.  But, with her size six trousers hanging loose over her hips, and not even the hint of a curve where once there was a perfectly sculpted alabaster cleavage, it is clear that Nicole Kidman has lost a disturbing amount of weight.  Emerging from a yoga class in New York, the 36-year-old actress looked skinnier than she has ever been.  Associates say that, at 5ft 10in, she weighs only 8st 3lb.  Several friends are concerned that she is dieting and exercising more than is healthy, and others wonder what can be behind the change.  One old friend, who remarked after embracing her recently that she was nothing but skin and bone, was told with a wan smile: ""Perhaps I have been overdoing it a little.""  She certainly takes vigorous exercise.  Exercising more than is healthy  As well as her regular yoga classes near her rented penthouse in the SoHo district, she swims and jogs often.  Recently she was seen jogging in a tracksuit, hat and gloves in a temperature of 30c.  Although her defenders say they have seen her dining on sea bass, or tucking in to chocolate ice cream, there are allegedly times when she prefers vegetable smoothies to a meal.  Currently her body mass index - expressing weight in relation to height - stands at just 16.  The healthy range is 20 to 25, and doctors become concerned if it drops below 18.  She is, then, clinically underweight.  Because she is so tall, the loss of 15lb since her marriage to Tom Cruise ended two-and-a-half years ago is clearly apparent.  Her agents, however, talked last night about her being happy and healthy, and vigorously denied any suggestions of an eating disorder.  Catherine Olim, her spokesman, said: ""Nicole has always been slender. Look at American Vogue, she is glorious. I don't know what the fuss is about.""  Those protests are given credibility by a 40-page spread in the magazine she refers to, which hit newsstands this week.  But Valentino says her figure is perfect  Miss Kidman looks stunning, posing in clothes by a string of designers.  (""She has the most perfect figure,"" coos Valentino.)  Her influence in the fashion world is so great that she is shortly to be unveiled as the international face of Chanel No 5 perfume.  In media terms, she has blossomed since splitting from Cruise; it is fair to say that she has never been in such demand.  But the question many are asking is why Nicole, who has relocated to New York with her two adopted children, Conor and Isabella, is looking so tired and nervy?  And why, they are wondering in Italy, has she pulled out of the Venice film festival?  And why, they wonder in Hollywood, has she turned down a £10million payday - the biggest of her career - to star in a film opposite Brad Pitt?  There are signs that Nicole - who said in the spring that she feared a ""burnout"" - is under a considerable amount of pressure, both emotional and professional.  She is still alone, despite a fling with rap star Q-Tip and a flirtation with rock star Lenny Kravitz, from whom she is renting a penthouse while her own pad in the city is renovated.  Her romantic friendship with Russell Crowe has foundered, and he has now married his on-off girlfriend Danielle, who is expecting a baby.  How painful this must be for Nicole, who longs to have a baby herself.  Overwhelmed with grief after miscarriage  She was, by her own admission, almost overwhelmed by grief when she had a miscarriage only six weeks after her marriage to Cruise ended.  Those who know her best say that she is still puzzling over the wreckage of that marriage and trying to come to terms with the feelings of abandonment and rejection which resulted.  ""I don't think two people could have been happier than Tom and I,"" she mused.  I was desperate to have a baby with Tom  ""He swept me off my feet and I fell madly, passionately in love. I was consumed by it. And I was desperate to have a baby with him. That's what I wish I'd done.""  Her vulnerable state of mind is not helped by a recurrence of the insomnia which has plagued her for much of her adult life.  Furthermore, she has been driven to the brink by film roles about rejected, depressed and oppressed women - with whom she identifies to a remarkable extent.  In an interview she said that she hesitated to play the suicidal Virginia Woolf in The Hours, because she feared the effect on her own state of mind.  ""I wasn't sure I could go through with it. Virginia Woolf's unhappiness was just too similar to my own.  Hesitated to play suicidal Virginia Woolf  ""I was afraid to do it because I thought it would be too painful,"" she said.  ""But I think characters come into your life sometimes because they're meant to ... I was able to use her and her knowledge.""  There are signs that she is no less troubled currently on the set of Stepford Wives in New York.  The crew are said to be muttering about delays because she does not want to film outside in strong sunshine.  Her representatives say this is utter nonsense. ""No one is more professional than Nicole,"" they aver, sternly.  But whatever the truth of those reports, one does wonder whether the film - a remake of the Seventies classic, about a town where wives are replaced by compliant domestic robots - has uncomfortable resonances for Nicole, whose Catholic beliefs were put aside by her Scientologist husband, and who, during her marriage, lost her identity in his.  What she yearns for is love - the love she gave to Cruise and which she still feels for him.  She yearns for love  ""I've said to Tom, I will be there for him for the rest of his life, always,"" she said earlier this year.  ""Tom and I had 11 years together. Your heart has to stay loving.""  She surprised everyone by admitting at the Cannes Film Festival that she would give up her career for love.  ""I won't do this for the rest of my life, there's other things that interest me,' she said.  ""I think when I fall in love, I'll stop doing as much of this because I want to settle down again.""  What she has experienced since then, though, are little more than dangerous flirtations.  Q-Tip, her escort at the premiere of The Hours, appeared to have been chosen because he is as unlike her former husband as it is possible to be.  Kravitz, meanwhile, took her to Puff Daddy's birthday party - again an event which would be anathema to strait-laced Cruise. In private, Nicole talks a great deal about concentrating on her children and trying to ""make it up to them"" - she feels immensely guilty about the divorce.  She also complains that she would like to find a man with whom she could have an intelligent conversation.  She is unhappily single  The Jude Law episode - when she was falsely accused of breaking up his marriage - was bruising and she felt humiliated that anyone would think she would steal another woman's husband.  Their meetings on both sides of the Atlantic were professional. In short, she remains steadfastly but unhappily single.  What a pity, for this is surely the golden period in Nicole's professional life. She took the Best Actress Oscar this spring for The Hours.  Later this year Cold Mountain, the Civil War epic directed by Anthony Minghella, will be released, and there is already an Oscar buzz forming about this bleak film.  Also later this year she will be seen in The Human Stain, opposite Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Then there is Birth, a film about a grieving widow, which she made early this year, and after that Stepford Wives, scheduled for release next year.  Because of delays in filming Stepford Wives, she has had to pull out of the Venice Film Festival, and because of the promotional schedule of Cold Mountain she has had to pull out of Mr and Mrs Smith, opposite Pitt.  Her diary is indeed creaking at the seams. And she is determined to make the most of her status while she can, despite the insecurity which leads her sometimes to fear taking on projects in case she is not good enough.  ""There was a time when part of me didn't really want to take on too many projects because I had other priorities like my marriage and my family,"" she said earlier this year.  ""Now I feel more confident. Also I find with two children that are older, that allows me a bit more time to devote to making films.  ""They don't need you every five minutes and they spend time with their father.  ""In any case I'm a pragmatist, and I won't always be offered these opportunities. Work while you can, I say.""  She is living very much the burnout life which she described in Cannes this year, travelling constantly and working hard.  Burnout lifestyle  ""You give so much of yourself and you've got to step away at some stage. You can't do it for ever,"" she said.  Could it be that the worryingly slight figure that emerged this week is evidence she is reaching the point of no return?"

"After months of speculation, Victoria’s Secret has officially announced the performers for this year's fashion show in Shanghai, which takes place on Monday.  Former One Directioner Harry Styles, Grammy winner Miguel, Hamilton alum Leslie Odom Jr. and Chinese pop sensation Jane Zhang are set to sing on the runway, VSFS executive producer Ed Razek said in a statement. “We are incredibly thrilled to have them with us,” he added.  Styles performing on tour in September Getty Images  The announcement follows reports that Katy Perry, who was rumored to perform in Shanghai, was banned from entering China. Gigi Hadid, who was confirmed to walk in this year’s show, was also reportedly denied entry. Word spread that the event was turning into a “media crisis,” but Razek denied those rumors.  “The news reports I’ve been reading from the US here in Shanghai regarding this year’s Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show are not an accurate reflection of what I’m seeing and experiencing on site,” he told People.  “The Chinese have been wonderful and enthusiastic hosts and partners,” he added. “From granting more than 700 visas, collaborating with us on every detail and introducing us to local experts who have helped us elevate our event in this renowned fashion city. We appreciate their efforts and all they have done to make this event a success. We look forward to the live show Monday night and the international broadcast a week later.”  Zhang performing with John Legend in 2015 Getty Images  Razek also teased that this year’s event will be Victoria’s Secret’s “most ambitious show by far.” In addition to the four performers, 55 models (they most they’ve ever had) from 17 countries will take the catwalk in Shanghai.  Styles, Miguel, Odom, and Zhang follow 2016's VSFS performers—Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, and The Weeknd. Though their appearances were just confirmed, rumblings of their performances spread online weeks before today's announcement.    Styles fans noticed that the singer's label, Columbia Records, appeared to announce on Monday he'd be performing his song ""Kiwi,"" off his new album at the VSFS. Fashionista notes that the singer's next tour performance isn't until November 23 (three days after the fashion show is filmed) in Singapore.  R&B favorite Miguel also became a potential VSFS contender when rumors of his appearance surfaced on Twitter. The smooth crooner has a new album, War & Leisure, due out on December 1, which means he has plenty of new material to perform at the show.  Miguel has just been confirmed to be performing at the 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. It will be aired on November 28th pic.twitter.com/zY34G4sKXT — Daily Miguel (@DailyMigueI) November 14, 2017  Perry was speculated to appear at the VSFS after a letter surfaced online, allegedly showing her agreement to perform, although that's no longer true. She was supposedly replacing Taylor Swift in the lineup—the Reputation singer was previously expected to make an appearance. Naturally the rumors of Swift, Styles, and Perry's castings caused a stir, considering Swift's romantic history with Styles (they briefly dated for a few months from 2012-2013) and her ongoing frenemy feud with Perry. But it looks like we'll be missing out on the drama this year.  The artists and models film in Shanghai on Monday, but the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show officially airs on November 28 at 10 p.m./9 p.m. central, on CBS."
"You won’t miss Justin Theroux driving around L.A. now! Jimmy Kimmel pranked his friend by turning his car into a moving billboard — and the TV host had a little help from Jennifer Aniston to pull it off.  “Your wife Jennifer Aniston helped me out. You know that recall notice you got for your car?” Kimmel, 49, asked Theroux during Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Tuesday, May 16. “There’s nothing wrong with the car. It was not being repaired. There’s nothing wrong with the drive shaft.”  Kimmel explained that he wanted to help Theroux, 45, campaign for an Emmy nomination for his role as Kevin Garvey in HBO’s The Leftovers. “Because I feel like HBO could be doing a better job of promoting this for you, we had some experts adorn your car in a way that is going to bring you a lot of attention,” the comedian said. “Let’s go outside to Hollywood Boulevard.”  The cameras showed Theroux’s black Mercedes covered in hilarious decals.

"Bling, bling, will she get a ring? The Irwin family caught up with Us Weekly on the set of Hallmark Channel’s Home & Family, where Bindi Irwin shared details about her relationship with boyfriend Chandler Powell.  When asked if the TV personality, 19, plans to get engaged to her boyfriend of four years, Irwin told Us, “That is a very, very good question and I think that at the moment everyone is kind of like, ‘Oh my goodness, are you guys going to get engaged?’ It’s all very exciting. For us, we’re just enjoying this time.”  The wildlife conservationist — who followed in the footsteps of her late father Steve Irwin — says that despite finding the “one”, she believes the couple should be focusing on enjoying their youth. “As young people, it’s all about school and then college and then getting a house and getting married and that’s fantastic, but sometimes we forget to live in the now,” Bindi explained. “So for us, in our relationship, we’re enjoying this moment and having so much fun traveling the world, working with animals, following our passion of conservation and just being together.”  Bindi’s mother, Terri Irwin, also told Us why the 21-year-old — who went out of his way to keep in touch with the Dancing With the Stars winner after meeting at her family’s zoo — has her seal of approval: “Chandler had his brother contact the zoo to ask my permission if Chandler could stay in touch with Bindi. And I thought, who does that? So permission granted and it’s been wonderful ever since.”  The happy couple debuted their romance in September 2015 at a taping for season 21 of Dancing With the Stars. Bindi later told Entertainment Tonight she knew Powell was “the one” after he put on a khaki Australia Zoo uniform, saying, “It was kind of one of those moments that was a real defining moment for me … only the people who are the closest to us that get their khakis.”  As for the patriarch of the Irwin family, Steve — who died in September 2006 after being stung by a stingray while filming a documentary — was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Thursday, April 26. The family is currently gearing up for the Steve Irwin Gala Dinner in Los Angeles on May 5.

"She’s doing just fine! Olivia Munn has landed a new gig hosting the Critics’ Choice Awards 2018 amid reports that her ex-boyfriend Aaron Rodgers has moved on with Danica Patrick.  The X-Men: Apocalypse actress, 37, will lead the star-studded event on Thursday, January 11, at Barker Hanger in Santa Monica, California. “We are absolutely thrilled to have Olivia hosting this year’s ceremony, and know that she will deliver an entertaining and sharp-witted evening to everyone in the room, and the viewers at home,” Broadcast Film Critics Association president Joey Berlin said in a statement. “Beyond her skills as an actress, Olivia’s work as an activist within the industry gives her a powerful voice, making her the perfect candidate to lead this night honoring the best and brightest in film and television.”  As previously reported, Munn was one of six women to allege sexual misconduct against director Brett Ratner in November 2017. The following month, she penned a candid essay for Entertainment Weekly about the “abuse of power” in Hollywood and expressed her staunch support for the “#MeToo” movement.  The news comes one day after the sports gossip blog Terez Owens reported that the Office Christmas Party star’s ex Rodgers, 34, was spotted on a date with Patrick, 35. “Danica and Aaron were all over each other, kissing and couldn’t seem to keep their hands off each other,” an eyewitness claimed to the site, noting that the NFL pro and the NASCAR driver had dinner together after Christmas at his favorite restaurant, Chives, in Green Bay, Wisconsin. “This is on the extreme down low, as they both want to keep this quiet for now. It’s early but they are really hitting it off.”  A source also claimed to Us Weekly that the two athletes are dating.  As previously reported, Rodgers and Munn split in April 2017 after three years together. According to an insider, the duo ended their romance due to tension the model had with the quarterback’s family. Meanwhile, Patrick and fellow race car driver Ricky Stenhouse Jr. called it quits on their five-year relationship in December 2017.  The 23rd Annual Critics Choice Awards will air on the CW Thursday, January 11, at 8 p.m. ET.

"Music icon Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez have been dating for more than a year, and the couple made a recent high-profile appearance together at the Met Gala, where A-Rod couldn't stop Instagramming.  Lopez visited The Tonight Show on Wednesday, and host Jimmy Fallon and Lopez broached the topic of marriage after playing a clip of Lopez's new song, El Anillo, which translates to ""the ring.""  When Fallon poked fun at A-Rod for stalling and asked if he was watching, J-Lo said there was ""no pressure.""  ""I feel like there's a point that all women get to where they're like, 'What's up?' It's like, we're good, everything's great, what's going on? Am I staying or am I…?""  If A-Rod and J-Lo do tie the knot, it seems likely that it'll happen sooner than later. J-Lo asked Fallon how long he dated his wife before their engagement, and Fallon revealed that the couple had been together for three years.  ""That's a lot. I feel like you know after… fairly quickly. So the rest is just like you being scared and whatever. But don't go by me, I've made tons of mistakes.""

"The Ocean's series is a collection of American heist films anchored by a trilogy edited, directed or produced by Steven Soderbergh. The original three films were written by George C. Johnson, George Nolfi, along with Brian Koppelman and David Levien, for each respective film. Released from 2001 to 2007, the trilogy is often cited as defining its genre and leading to a proliferation and commercialization of heist films throughout the world.[1][2]  Based on the 1960 Rat Pack film, Ocean's 11, the series has seen mixed to favorable critical reception and substantial commercial success. Collectively grossing US$1.17 billion worldwide, the most commercially successful rendition was the first, Ocean's Eleven (2001). It established the ensemble cast of George Clooney, Matt Damon, and Brad Pitt, as Danny Ocean, Linus Caldwell, and Rusty Ryan, respectively. A long list of supporting cast members maintain the trilogy. The first sequel, Ocean's Twelve was released in 2004 with the third and final film, Ocean's Thirteen, following in 2007. An all-female spin-off written and directed by Gary Ross, Ocean's 8 was released on June 8, 2018, 11 years to the day after Thirteen's release.  Inspiration [ edit ]  The Ocean's film series was inspired by the 1960 heist film, Ocean's 11, directed by Lewis Milestone and starring five of the Rat Pack: Peter Lawford, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Joey Bishop.[3]  Ocean's trilogy [ edit ]  Ocean's Eleven (2001) [ edit ]  Master thief Danny Ocean (George Clooney), just out of prison, plans an elaborate Las Vegas three-casino-heist to win back his ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts). To that end, he recruits eight other thieves and con men to pull off the complex job, eventually stealing US$160 million.  Ocean's Twelve (2004) [ edit ]  The Ocean's crew is blackmailed by the Casino owner they stole from–Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia)–into paying him $198 million (their loot plus interest). The team is given two weeks to come up with the money so they travel to Europe to execute three heists. In order to extend the deadline they attempt to steal world's oldest stock certificate, issued by the Dutch East India Company in 1602. Worth €2.5 million, the certificate is stolen just before the crew get there by a rival thief–""The Night Fox"" (Vincent Cassel). The rival thief proposes to the crew a competition to steal Hermitage Museum's Imperial Coronation Egg in order to find out who is the best there is in the world. In exchange for the competition, the rival thief offers to pay back the $198 million debt they have with Terry Benedict. With only a week left, the crew agrees and eventually loses the competition after a Europol detective, Agent Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), catches them in the act. After this it is revealed that The Night Fox's mentor, Gaspar LeMarc, was behind the heist all along. He told the Ocean's crew to go to the museum beforehand, switch out the real egg for a fake one and convince The Night Fox to steal it. After Danny Ocean explains this plot, he is given the $198 million promised and pays off Terry Benedict.  Ocean's Thirteen (2007) [ edit ]  Ocean and his crew plan to rig a new casino's opening night after its ruthless owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) double crosses one of the gang, with plans to make his life a worthless cesspit of misery, a figurative Tartarus of unending misfortune which needs no explanation apart from a vengeful crew of incredibly skilled thieves.  Ocean's 8 (2018) [ edit ]  Soderbergh and George Clooney initially downplayed the possibility of an Ocean's Fourteen or subsequent sequels due to Bernie Mac's death in 2008.[4] However, a new Ocean's Eleven spin-off with an all-female cast led by Sandra Bullock as the sister of George Clooney's Danny Ocean was put in development. It was conceived by producer Jerry Weintraub, Soderbergh and Clooney. Olivia Milch wrote the screenplay, and Gary Ross directed the film.[5][6] Helena Bonham Carter, Cate Blanchett and Mindy Kaling were later announced to star in the film.[7] Elizabeth Banks had previously been attached to the project, but a deal between her and Warner Bros. could not be reached.[8]  The title of the spin-off was later revealed to be Ocean's Eight.[9] In August 2016, Anne Hathaway, Rihanna and Nora ""Awkwafina"" Lum were also confirmed to join the cast.[10] The night after her Emmy win, Sarah Paulson was announced as the final cast member of the titular eight.[11] The film was released in the United States on June 8, 2018.[12]  Cast [ edit ]  Reception [ edit ]  Box office performance [ edit ]  Film Release date Box office revenue Box office ranking Budget Reference United States Foreign Worldwide All time domestic All time worldwide Ocean's Eleven December 7, 2001 $183,417,150 $267,300,000 $450,717,150 #231 #229 $85 million [13] Ocean's Twelve December 10, 2004 $125,544,280 $237,200,000 $362,744,280 #483 #324 $110 million [14] Ocean's Thirteen June 8, 2007 $117,154,724 $194,157,900 $311,312,624 #542 #419 $85 million [15][16] Ocean's 8 June 8, 2018 $139,055,376 $152,700,000 $291,755,376 #394 #465 $70 million [17] Total $565,171,530 $851,357,900 $1,416,529,430 N/A N/A $350 million [18]  Critical reaction [ edit ]"

"Scheana Shay doesn’t even have to watch Vanderpump Rules to know how her relationship with now ex-boyfriend Rob Valletta has come off to fans.  “I will admit, I haven’t watched the last few episodes … last season, watching my divorce wasn’t as hard for me because I was in a very happy relationship, and I was madly in love with Rob,” Shay told costar and BFF Ariana Madix on the Tuesday, March 6, episode of her podcast, Scheananigans.  “Wait, you were?” Madix said sarcastically.  “I kept it super low-key,” Shay joked.  As previously reported, the SUR waitress filed for divorce from her husband of over two years, Mike Shay, in November 2016. She started dating Valletta shortly after, and viewers have been quick to criticize their relationship, calling Shay “pathetic” and “cringeworthy” on Twitter because she is seemingly more invested in their future than he is.  “Now I’m single, I’ve been single for six months now, watching back me being that happy, love drunk girl, started to get a little hard,” Shay explained. “Obviously, you can’t see every minute of every conversation … I know I look really stupid, and you know what? I was coming off a divorce. I got back with someone who I felt was my soulmate and was the one … You can’t fault me for being happy and being in love.”  “Rob was very reserved on the show,” she continued. “He is a person who lives his life on camera, acting and hosting, not for a reality show. For him, that was completely out of his comfort zone. He is a very private person … So for him, that was hard to have those raw emotions on there. The moments that we had in private are private moments. He did tell me he loved me. We were planning a future together, but then, just this world that he became a part of was too overwhelming for him to continue.”  Valletta defended Shay on February 26 after fans slammed their relationship: “No one knows what happens behind closed doors and or when the cameras are off. But what I do know is that there are things that I never expressed on camera, but did in person. The reason I created space in our relationship was because of the world, not the person. @scheana and I have cared for and supported each other for 12 years no matter the circumstances or dynamic.

"Winter is coming thawing soon: HBO just revealed a few tantalizing details on the upcoming Game of Thrones prequel series.  “We are doing a pilot that Jane Goldman wrote,” HBO programming president Casey Bloys confirmed for reporters at the Television Critics Association summer press tour on Wednesday. With HBO exploring five different GoT spinoff concepts, “we’d be lucky to get one that we’re very, very excited about, and we did get that. We’re just starting the search for a director… we have to cast it. We hope to be shooting sometime in the new year.”  HBO ordered a pilot for the untitled prequel last month, with the action set thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones. Per the official logline, “the series chronicles the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros’ history to the true origin of the white walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend… it’s not the story we think we know.”  In addition to writing the pilot, Goldman (X-Men: First Class) will serve as showrunner, and will join Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin as an executive producer. You’ll have to wait a bit to see it, though: Bloys said earlier this year the prequel won’t debut until at least a year after the original GoT wraps up its final season — which won’t start until the first half of 2019."
"Just one week after making history at the box office, “Wonder Woman” has been given the Oprah Winfrey treatment. The media empress threw a “Wonder Woman”-themed party on Tuesday, complete with a cake, flip-flops, popcorn buckets and the superhero’s signature headpiece and wrist cuffs.  Winfrey documented the party preparations on her Instagram account with a series of videos. “It’s ‘Wonder Woman’ day at my house,” she declared in the first, adding, “I’m having a party for 28 10-year-olds.” She proceeded to outfit a “Wonder Woman” cake with a topper featuring the superhero herself.  By the second video, Winfrey had entered full fangirl mode, going so far as to place the “Wonder Woman” headpiece on her own head. She’s also wearing the signature wrist cuffs as she raves about themed popcorn buckets and cups. She then displays pairs of “Wonder Woman” flip-flops, capping off her video series with a shot of the chef preparing some salad.  “Wonder Woman” raked in a whopping $223 million globally when it opened two weeks ago, making it the biggest opening for a film directed by a woman. Starring Gal Gadot, the film has garnered both high-end and mass-market appeal. Luxury brands such as Givenchy and Louis Vuitton along with mass-market retailers like Hot Topic and Kohl’s have all created products inspired by the 75-year-old character.  “Wonder Woman is a pioneer in many ways including being a fashion icon,” says Soo Koo, Warner Bros. Consumer Products’ chief creative officer. “These collections celebrate her as an iconic superhero and empower fans of all kinds to be confident and strong.”  Judging from Winfrey’s Instagram videos, this much is clear: She, too, seems to have fallen prey to the “Wonder Woman” mass-market bug.

"Sofia Richie (born August 24, 1998)[1] is an American fashion model. She has been featured in campaigns by a number of major brands including Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors and Chanel. She is the youngest daughter of singer and songwriter Lionel Richie and adoptive sister to fashion designer and television personality Nicole Richie.  Early life [ edit ]  Sofia Richie was born in Los Angeles, California to parents Lionel Richie and his second wife Diane Alexander. She is the younger sister of Nicole Richie (who was adopted) and the biological sister of Miles Richie.[1] Sofia Richie's godfather was Michael Jackson. She reported that the visits to Jackson's Neverland Ranch were some of her favorite memories as a child, and she became close friends with his daughter, Paris.[2]  Richie grew up with an affinity for music like her father. She learned to sing at age 5 and to play the piano at age 7.[3] She made occasional appearances at her father's shows[2] and took vocal lessons from Beyonce's vocal coach, Tim Carter, when she was 14, as well.[3] She also worked in the studio with her brother-in-law (and Good Charlotte lead vocalist) Joel Madden.[4][3] She decided to move away from a music career, however, because of the pressure of living up to her father's stature in the music industry.[5]  Richie spent some time at Oaks Christian School—nicknamed ""Celebrity High""—before being educated at home for several years while her father was on tour. She played soccer until age 16 when she broke her hip in a Segway accident.[5]  Modeling career [ edit ]  Richie began modeling at age 14 with a feature in Teen Vogue[4] and at 15 she got her first fashion contract with Los Angeles-based swimwear company Mary Grace Swim.[6] The next year, Richie signed with London-based modeling agency Select Model Management.[7]  Richie has featured in advertising campaigns for a number of brands including DL1961,[8] Madonna's Material Girl line,[2] Chanel,[9] Dolce & Gabbana,[9] Adidas, Michael Kors,[11] and Tommy Hilfiger.[9] She has done photoshoots for Elle and Vanity Fair[5] and has recently appeared on the cover of Complex[5] and Billboard magazine's style issue.[3]"
"TLC has officially severed its ties with former “Counting On” star Derick Dillard after he repeatedly made negative comments about one of the network’s other stars, Jazz Jennings.  On Saturday, the network released a statement on Twitter explaining that it has severed ties with Dillard after another round of comments against Jennings, who stars on her own series, “I Am Jazz,” which chronicles her life following her decision at a young age to transition from a male to a female.  “We want to let our viewers know that Derick Dillard has not participated in ‘Counting On’ for months and the network has no plans to feature him in the future. We want to reiterate that Derick’s personal statements do not reflect the views of the network,” the statement reads. “TLC is proud to share the story of Jazz jennings and her family and will continue to do so.”  The decision from the network comes after Dillard spoke for a second time about Jennings, arguing that he doesn’t believe that one can change their gender identity and refused to use feminine pronouns when discussing Jennings.  “I pity Jazz, 4 those who take advantage of him in order 2 promote their agenda, including the parents who allow these kinds of decisions 2 be made by a child. It’s sad that ppl would use a juvenile this way. Again, nothing against him, just unfortunate what’s on tv these days,” he wrote in response to another commenter who brought up his older comments about Jennings.  As previously reported, Dillard, who came to fame alongside his wife Jill Duggar on TLC, previously took issue with Jennings saying that gender is “ordained by God.”  “What an oxymoron… a 'reality' show which follows a non-reality. 'Transgender' is a myth. Gender is not fluid; it’s ordained by God.”  Jennings, who hasn’t directly responded to Dillard’s latest comments, said at the time:  “Every day I experience cyber-bullying, but I keep sharing my story. Today was no different.”  Dillard continued to respond to his latest statements, saying that he’s just trying to have a mature discussion about his concerns as a Christian. He also speculated as to the capability of a child to make decisions about their gender identity. However, people on Twitter were mostly unimpressed with his justification, and it was enough to prompt the network to completely sever ties with him."
"[Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.]  XXXTentacion had been a rising star in hip-hop, landing a No. 1 album in March despite existing largely outside of the mainstream music business. He first gained popularity on the streaming platform SoundCloud and became something of a poster child for the digital age, with millions of young fans tracking his every utterance. But XXXTentacion was also mired in controversy and legal troubles, and was awaiting trial on charges including aggravated battery of a pregnant victim, false imprisonment and witness tampering at the time of his death.  Image Michael Boatwright was served an arrest warrant for first-degree murder in the killing of XXXTentacion. Credit Broward Sheriff's Office  On the day he was killed, the rapper visited Riva Motorsports with a friend. The police said two men followed XXXTentacion into the store and later, as he was leaving the dealership, blocked his vehicle and exited a dark-colored S.U.V. brandishing guns and demanding property. After a brief struggle, at least one of the suspects fired at the rapper, who was later pronounced dead at a hospital.  “The investigation continues,” the Broward County Sheriff’s Office said in its news release on Wednesday.  Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward said that his department was withholding additional information about the arrest of Mr. Boatwright, and sealed the arrest report, as it continued to pursue the case, the Sun-Sentinel reported.  “We’re not releasing any information about it because we’re still looking for two other suspects, including Robert Allen,” Mr. Israel said. “If we release more information about the case, it may hamper detectives’ ability or impede their progress to make those other arrests and take those two individuals into custody.”  Since XXXTentacion’s death, his music has surged on streaming platforms, sending both of his official albums into the Top 5 on the Billboard chart; the single “Sad!” also reached No. 1 last month. According to his associates, XXXTentacion had been close to finishing a new album, and had signed a $10 million deal for its release just weeks before he was killed."
"  Terry Crews arrives at an event in Beverly Hills, Calif., in November 2017. (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)  Last October, as the #MeToo earthquake was beginning to rip through the Hollywood power structure following abuse allegations connected to producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Terry Crews significantly readjusted the national conversation.  In tweets, the “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” star laid out his own claims of experiencing sexual harassment. At a party in 2016, a “high-level Hollywood executive” came up to Crews and “groped my privates,” the actor wrote. Crews later publicly identified the executive as Adam Venit, a longtime industry power-player who represented marquee names such as Adam Sandler, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy and Vince Vaughn. Crews went on to file a police report about the incident, as well as a lawsuit against Venit and his agency, William Morris Endeavor.  But Crews’s revelation reverberated well beyond his own case. His public stand detonated stereotypes by showing a 240-pound former NFL player could also be the victim of sexual assault, thus widening the lens of the #MeToo movement. Time included Crews among the “the silence breakers” named in the magazine’s person of the year feature.  Now, Crews’s legal case has come to an end. On Thursday, William Morris Endeavor announced the lawsuit has been settled.  “Terry Crews, Adam Venit and WME have settled the lawsuit Mr. Crews filed last year,” the agency said in a statement, according to the Hollywood Reporter. “It will be dismissed.”  According to Deadline, Venit is also planning to retire from WME on Monday. He had previously been suspended and demoted following Crews’s allegation.  After news of the settlement and Venit’s exit, Crews responded on Twitter with a single word: “ACCOUNTABILITY,” he wrote.  That was the theme Crews has continually hit on since speaking out.  “People need to be held accountable,” the actor told “Good Morning America” last November. “This is the deal about Hollywood. It is an abuse of power. This guy, again, he’s one of the most powerful [men] in Hollywood, and he looked at me at the end as if, ‘Who is going to believe you?’”  “The assault lasted only minutes, but what he was effectively telling me while he held my genitals in his hand was that he held the power. That he was in control,” Crews told the Senate Judiciary Committee this summer. “As I shared my story, I was told over and over that this was not abuse. This was just a joke. This was just horseplay. But I can say one man’s horseplay is another man’s humiliation.”  In his lawsuit, filed last December, Crews recounted his alleged encounter with the star agent. “Venit, upon his first meeting Crews, viciously grabbed Crews’s penis and testicles so hard that it caused Crews immediate pain in a blatant and unprovoked sexual assault,” the lawsuit stated.  Crews, who was not Venit’s client, reportedly told his own WME agent about the assault the next day. But the agency did nothing, his lawsuit claimed, as part of “corporate culture that fosters environments in which WME agents are knowingly permitted and encouraged to engage in misconduct, including sexually predatory conduct.”  In court filings, Venit denied the allegations, the Associated Press reported.  According to the Reporter, a criminal investigation into the assault spearheaded by the Los Angeles Police Department commenced last November. In March, the prosecutors announced they were declining criminal charges because of “the lapse in statute of limitations for misdemeanor cases.”  But the allegations also triggered an internal review at WME. The Reporter wrote that the agency’s internal review determined that Crews’s allegation about Venit was “indicative of a pattern, rather than an isolated event.” The agent was bumped down from his position as the head of the agency’s motion picture group.  Venit’s demotion — and now exit — from the industry represented a significant nose dive for a man who was a considerable force within Hollywood for more than three decades. According to Deadline, the agent started out working in the mailroom at Creative Artists Agency in 1986 after dropping out of law school. He later went on to represent some of the biggest movie stars in the business."
"Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was born Jacqueline Lee Bouvier on July 28, 1929, in Southampton, New York. She married John F. Kennedy in 1953. When she became first lady in 1961, she worked to restore the White House to its original elegance and to protect its holdings. After JFK's assassination in 1963, she moved to New York City. She married Aristotle Onassis in 1968. She died of cancer in 1994.  Early Life  Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was born on July 28, 1929, in Southampton, New York. Her father, John Bouvier, was a wealthy New York stockbroker of French Catholic descent, and her mother, Janet, was an accomplished equestrienne of Irish Catholic heritage. Onassis was a bright, curious and occasionally mischievous child. One of her elementary school teachers described her as ""a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil."" Another teacher, less charmed by young Jacqueline, wrote admonishingly that ""her disturbing conduct in geography class made it necessary to exclude her from the room.""  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Onassis enjoyed a privileged childhood of ballet lessons at the Metropolitan Opera House and French lessons beginning at age of 12. Like her mother, Onassis loved riding and was highly skilled on horseback. In 1940, at the age of 11, she won a national junior horsemanship competition. The New York Times reported, ""Jacqueline Bouvier, an eleven-year-old equestrienne from East Hampton, Long Island, scored a double victory in the horsemanship competition. Miss Bouvier achieved a rare distinction. The occasions are few when the same rider wins both competitions in the same show.""  Onassis attended Miss Porter's School, a prestigious boarding school in Farmington, Connecticut; in addition to its rigorous academics, the school also emphasized proper manners and the art of conversation. There she excelled as a student, writing frequent essays and poems for the school newspaper and winning the award as the school's top literature student in her senior year. Also during her senior year, in 1947, Onassis was named ""Debutante of the Year"" by a local newspaper. However, Onassis had greater ambitions than being recognized for her beauty and popularity. She wrote in the yearbook that her life ambition was ""not to be a housewife.""  Upon graduating from Miss Porter's School Onassis enrolled at Vassar College in New York to study history, literature, art and French. She spent her junior year studying abroad in Paris. ""I loved it more than any year of my life,"" Onassis later wrote about her time there. ""Being away from home gave me a chance to look at myself with a jaundiced eye. I learned not to be ashamed of a real hunger for knowledge, something that I had always tried to hide, and I came home glad to start in here again but with a love for Europe that I am afraid will never leave me.""  Upon returning from Paris, Onassis transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and graduated with a B.A. in French literature in 1951. After graduating from college in 1951, Onassis landed a job as the ""Inquiring Camera Girl"" for the Washington Times-Herald newspaper. Her job was to photograph and interview various Washington residents, and then weave their pictures and responses together in her column. Among her most notable stories were an interview with Richard Nixon, coverage of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration and a report on the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.  U.S. First Lady  It was at a dinner party in 1952 that Onassis met a dashing young congressman and senator-elect from Massachusetts named John F. Kennedy; he ""leaned across the asparagus and asked her for a date."" They were married a year later, on September 12, 1953. Onassis gave birth to her first child, Caroline Kennedy, in 1957. That same year, she encouraged Kennedy to write and, subsequently, helped him edit Profiles in Courage, his famous book about U.S. senators who had risked their careers to stand for causes they believed in.  In January 1960, John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the U.S. presidency. Although Onassis was pregnant at the time and thus unable to join him on the campaign trail, she campaigned tirelessly from home. She answered letters, gave interviews, taped commercials and wrote a weekly syndicated newspaper column called ""Campaign Wife.""  On November 8, 1960, Kennedy defeated Richard Nixon by a razor-thin margin to become the 35th president of the United States; less three weeks later, Onassis gave birth to their second child, John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. The couple had a third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy born prematurely on August 7, 1963, but lost the child two days later.  Onassis's first mission as first lady was to transform the White House into a museum of American history and culture that would inspire patriotism and public service in those who visited. ""Every boy who comes here should see things that develop his sense of history,"" she once said. Onassis went to extraordinary lengths to procure art and furniture owned by past presidents—including artifacts owned by George Washington, James Madison and Abraham Lincoln—as well as pieces she considered representative of various periods of American culture. ""Everything in the White House must have a reason for being there,"" she insisted. ""It would be sacrilege merely to 'redecorate' it—a word I hate. It must be restored—and that has nothing to do with decoration. That is a question of scholarship.""  As the culmination of her project, Onassis gave a tour of the restored White House on national television on February 14, 1962. A record 56 million viewers watched her televised special, and Onassis won an honorary Emmy Award for her performance.  As first lady, Onassis was also a great patron of the arts. In addition to the officials, diplomats and statesman who typically populated state dinners, Onassis also invited the nation's leading writers, artists, musicians and scientists to mingle with its top politicians. The great violinist Isaac Stern wrote to Onassis after one such dinner, ""It would be difficult to tell you how refreshing, how heartening it is to find such serious attention and respect for the arts in the White House. To many of us it is one of the most exciting developments on the present American cultural scene.""  Additionally, Onassis frequently traveled abroad, both with the president and alone, and her deep knowledge of foreign cultures and languages (she spoke fluent French, Spanish and Italian) helped garner goodwill toward America. She was so adoringly received in France that President Kennedy introduced himself as ""the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris."" Presidential advisor Clark Clifford wrote to Onassis, ""Once in a great while, an individual will capture the imagination of people all over the world. You have done this; and what is more important, through your graciousness and tact, you have transformed this rare accomplishment into an incredibly important asset to this nation."""

"Marvel’s Runaways are finally living up to their name.  The Hulu superhero series, from executive producers Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage (Gossip Girl), returns for its second season on Dec. 21 and EW has an exclusive look at the new trailer above.  At the end of season 1, the titular band of teens, after discovering their parents are supervillains, finally ran away from home. “This year is much more the cat-and-mouse [game] and the two sides going to war,” says Savage. So, naturally, season 2 begins with the friends finding a new place to hide as they strategize on how to deal with their diabolical parental units. “It’s in Griffith Park,” Savage explains of the hideout, which is called the Hostel in the comics that inspired the streaming series. “It was originally built in the 1920s by a magician. It was lived in for many years, [but] perhaps sometime in the ’60s or ’70s there was an earthquake or mudslide that made it uninhabitable.” Adds Schwartz, “We wanted it to be our equivalent of, like, the Batcave.” Teenagers really need a place to hang out…even if it’s an underground dust-filled mansion.  Greg Lewis / Hulu  In the above photo from episode 4, the gang enjoys a candlelit meal in the dining room with Molly’s (Allegra Acosta) enigmatic new acquaintance Topher (Jan Luis Castellanos). “He is a character who’s from the comics,” Schwartz teases of the character also seen in the new trailer. “He’s not all that he appears to be.” Interiors for the Hostel were constructed at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles and were massive. “It’s the biggest set that Marvel Television has ever built,” says Schwartz. “When [comic co-creator] Brian K. Vaughan came to the set for the first time, he had tears in his eyes.” We’re pretty sure it wasn’t the dust.  Greg Lewis / Hulu  The Hostel even blesses the group with some new accessories thanks to an antiquated but full closet. “There’s the perfect wide-legged 1970s jeans for Karolina (Virginia Gardner) and the perfect leather jacket for Gert (Ariela Barer) and an adorable tiny tuxedo jacket for Nico (Lyrica Okanu),” says Savage. “So everything you’d want from every era is hiding in that closet.” No one wants to be dressed in sweats when you’re saving the world.  Marvel’s Runaways returns Dec. 21 on Hulu.  Related content:"

"Two former partners of Chip Gaines in the creation of the Magnolia Real Estate Company are suing the “Fixer Upper” star for fraud, claiming that Gaines bought them out without telling them that HGTV had decided to broadcast the show nationally “and that the show prominently featured the ‘Magnolia’ brand name.”  (Photo by Neal Klaeser)  In the 24-page lawsuit filed Wednesday in state district court in Waco, Gaines’s two former partners, lawyers John L. Lewis and Richard L. Clark, are seeking more than $1 million in damages and non-monetary relief, as well.  Gaines’ spokesman declined to comment on the suit, but his attorney, Jordan Mayfield, told KWTX Thursday, “We are confident that these claims will be found to be meritless, and it is disappointing to see people try to take advantage of the hard work and success of Chip and Joanna Gaines.""  Lewis and Clark were equal partners with Gaines in founding the Magnolia Real Estate Company in 2007.  The suit says that for the first six years, the company largely operated in Waco with a single real estate agent.  The suit claims Gaines worked out a deal with HGTV for the “Fixer Upper” program without telling his partners and that Gaines planned on featuring the Magnolia brand name.  Gaines bought their shares of Magnolia Real estate for $2,500 each, the suit says.  ""With this insider information in hand, Chip Gaines convinced plaintiffs to sell their membership interests in Magnolia Realty quickly to him before a public announcement that “Fixer Upper” was picked up by HGTV.""  The suit, which also names Magnolia Realty, Scripps Networks Interactive, Scripps networks LLC and High Noon Entertainment which produces the show, claims Gaines pressured Lewis and Clark to sell “before they discovered the company’s value was radically enhanced by ‘Fixer Upper.’”  When Clark balked at the terms of the buyout, the suit alleges Gaines sent a text advising Lewis to tell Clark “to be careful.”  “I don’t come from the nerdy prep school he’s from. And when people talk to me that way they get their asses kicked. And if he’s not ready to do that he better shut his mouth. I’m not the toughest guy there is, but I can assure you that would not end well for [R]ick,” the text read, according to the suit.  Since the show debuted, the suit says, Magnolia has grown from a single-agent firm to one that employs “over 93 real estate agents, and a support staff, and now operates in nearly every major city in Texas.”  In addition to monetary damages, the suit seeks rescission of the sale of the company or fair value for Lewis’ and Clark’s interest, payment of salaries, bonuses in-kind benefits and distributions they would have received as partners"
"It's too early to tell if the film is even gonna happen, but it's not looking good for A.  Our insider says Kristen was approached to fill Jolie's hot-woman void in the franchise and met at least once with Timur Bekmambetov, the director of the series.  However, Angelina's participation in the project is still up in the air.  While her character died in the first installment of the film, Bekmambetov told MTV that he would bring her back in some capacity, in the sequel.  Only problem is A.J. reportedly backed out of the film. We hear details (aka money and exactly how much time she'd need to give to the flick) were never worked out, which is why Angelina is out, for now—but she could possibly make a cameo if the film actually happens.  So can Kristen save the franchise?  Our dishy source says the Stewart-McAvoy version of the project might not come to fruition, but it remains a slim possibility—and wouldn't it be damn hot! (Sure would be a lot happier news than that horrible fake car accident stuff which had K.Stew fans in a tizzy yesterday.)  Kristen is set to start filming Breaking Dawn possibly as early as October, while the Wanted follow-up was originally slated to start shooting around the end of August.  No production date has been set in stone for the final Twilight flick(s), which is making it difficult, we're told, for many of the actors involved in the vampire franchise to figure out their schedule allowed for outside projects. Anyone remember Rachelle Lefevre?  Be careful before you sign up for other projects, dearies!  Neither Bekmambetov nor a rep for Stewart responded to E!'s request for comment. While no offer was officially given to Kristen, word is that Bekmambetov is—for now—looking at other projects for the fall, given the scheduling conflicts.  Bummer! Nobody kicks ass like K.Stew."

The comedian appeared on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” on Tuesday night and showed off her Gadot impersonation skills.  She talked about her interactions with the “Wonder Woman” star when the Israeli-born actress hosted “Saturday Night Live” in October.

"T.I. has a few words for Rob Kardashian after the reality star claimed the rapper had a threesome with his ex-fiancée Blac Chyna and T.I.’s ex-wife Tameka “Tiny” Harris back in the day.  TMZ caught up with the 36-year-old rapper at Los Angeles International Airport over the weekend.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Don’t tell women’s business. That’s bad. That’s very, very bad. Poor character. Flawed, you know what I mean?” T.I. — born Clifford Harris — said. “If a woman trusted you and confided in you with secrets and stuff like that, you don’t ever let that — you don’t do that. Secrets are sacred, you don’t do that. That’s a whole other level of f—boy s— right there.”  T.I. added that he thinks Kardashian, 30, is going to have a hard time hooking up with women after exposing Chyna, 29, in a series of now-deleted rants on social media.  One post called out T.I. after the rapper criticized Kardashian for taking his feud with Chyna public.  “Why bring ya business to IG tho? Look, You got worked bro….but at least keep it to yourself, you letting the world know you a duck. I mean a BIG DUCK, a mighty duck, Ronald McDonald the Duck, Scrooge McDuck, Howard the Druck, Huey Dewy & Lewie… save the #DuckTales Just hold this L, kiss ya kid & cut ya losses& move on… u got no moves bro,” T.I. said, according to a Instagram comment captured by Baller Alert.  “Since TI wanna chime in on business that don’t concern him let’s talk about the threesome you had with Chyna and your baby mama Tiny,” Kardashian replied. “Don’t speak on my daughter when u having threesomes with young Chy and Tiny ::: and I put that on my daughters life since u wanna speak on my daughter,,, damn shame. Chyna told me everything about your threesomes with you and her and Tiny. U got no moves bro ;;; Correction ::: TI paid Chyna to have sex with Tiny and him.”  RELATED VIDEO: Rob Kardashian Puts ‘Cheating’ Ex Blac Chyna on Blast with Explicit Photos  After Kardashian put Chyna on blast, including posting explicit photos of her, high-powered civil rights attorney Lisa Bloom announced Friday that she is now legally representing Chyna and is seeking restraining orders against Kardashian on behalf of her client.  “I represent Blac Chyna,” Bloom tweeted Friday. “I just gave Rob Kardashian notice that we’ll be in court Monday seeking restraining orders against him.

"Just because two people are in love and are great together doesn't mean the idea of marriage should continuously be forced upon them. For example, once again, Jennifer Lopez has said she's not marrying Alex Rodriguez — at this point in time. The marriage question is one the World of Dance judge is repeatedly asked. It's also an exhausting topic that Lopez should no longer have to discuss during every interview.  During Thursday's The Ellen DeGeneres Show, host Ellen DeGeneres brought up Lopez's relationship with Rodriguez and the possibility of the two saying ""I do."" DeGeneres began the conversation by telling J. Lo and referring to A-Rod, ""He said that y'all are gonna be getting married.""  The former Shades of Blue star quickly denied that statement by declaring, ""He did not say that. He did not say that.""  The two went back and forth a bit in a joking manner about Rodriguez's supposed declaration of marriage. But, that wasn't enough to stop DeGeneres from, once again, asking Lopez, ""So, you'll be getting married?""  The multifaceted Lopez answered, ""I don't know. I don't know."" DeGeneres pushed further by stating, ""You should, cuz y'all seem very happy."" The Second Act star agreed with the latter. ""We are,"" she said. ""We've been together a couple years, it's nice.""  TheEllenShow on YouTube  Of course, DeGeneres didn't stop there and said about them having a wedding, ""It would be good to do for Christmas.""  However, rather than giving a verbal response, Lopez reacted with the most telling facial expression. Here it is:  At this point of the marriage conversation, Lopez was still laughing and going along with DeGeneres, but it also seemed like she didn't know what else to say. It was almost like The Fosters executive producer was ready to move on to something else.  Was DeGeneres mainly teasing? Yes. Is she happy for the duo and wants them to live a beautiful life together? Of course. Does she really care or is trying to force them to get married? No. The interview was all in good fun and one Lopez took extremely well. That said, it has to get old reciting the same thing over and over again about your personal relationship.  Andrew Toth/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  In a Harper's Bazaar interview published on March 15, Lopez once again said about getting married, ""I do believe in marriage. And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now. It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well.""  Then, during a June 11 Good Morning America interview, Lopez said about marrying Rodriguez, ""We have to take our time. I've made plenty of mistakes in my past and ... we're mature now."" She continued,  ""We're grown ups and we're going to take our time and we're going to do things at our own pace. And our life right now is incredibly wonderful. Between our kids and our work we're truly blessed. We don't need anything more right now.""  How many more times does she need to say it? They are content with the current status of their relationship. The two certainly aren't in any rush to walk down the aisle. Even if someone's just joking around with Lopez and Rodriguez about marriage, having to repeatedly field those types of questions and to reaffirm their happiness is tiring. Let's all just let them enjoy their relationship without the pressure of marriage."
"Allison Janney has celebrated her Oscar win by sporting a top bearing the slogan: “I survived awards season and all I got was this lousy T-shirt!”  The 58-year-old Hollywood star ended her successful run at the recent spate of awards ceremonies by taking the best supporting actress award for her performance in I, Tonya at the Academy Awards on Sunday.  Hours later, Janney went back to work on her sitcom Mom, where she showed off a new garment given to her by a colleague that poked fun at her many wins over the past few months.  In a picture shared on Instagram, Janney – standing next to her Oscar – sported a top that read: “I survived awards season and all I got was this lousy T-shirt!  “And a Golden Globe, SAG Award, Bafta, Critic’s Choice, Spirit Award, Hollywood Film Award, AACTA International Award, SB Outstanding Performer of the Year and a freakin’ Oscar.”  She wrote in the caption: “I LOVE this shirt Chelsea (from our @mom_cbs writing team)! It pretty much sums up the past few months. #Oscars.”  Janney’s hairdresser Jill Crosby previously shared a video of the star showing off her Oscar to her team in her hotel room as they all scream in delight.  Janney triumphed in her category for her portrayal of LaVona Golden, the mother of disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding."
"Chris Brown has opened up about his assault on Rihanna that landed him in court in 2009.  “I felt like a f**king monster,” the 28-year-old singer said in the documentary Chris Brown: Welcome To My Life.  Brown said the fight with Rihanna started when she became jealous that his ex showed up at a pre-Grammys party they attended.  “She starts going off, she throws the phone, ‘I hate you!’, whatever, whatever, she starts hitting me, we’re in a little Lamborghini, you know she’s fighting me,” Brown claimed.  “Like I remember she tried to kick me, just like her beating s**t, but then I really hit her. With a closed fist, like I punched her, and it busted her lip, and when I saw it I was in shock, I was ‘f**k, why did I hit her like that?’”  Brown recalled: “So from there she’s…spitting blood in my face, it raised me even more. It’s a real fight in the car, and we driving in the street.  “She grabbed my nuts. And when she did that, I bite her arm while I’m still trying to drive.”  Brown was arrested and eventually pleaded guilty to assault and got five years of probation and was ordered to do six months of community service and attend domestic violence counselling.  In the documentary, the singer said his relationship with Rihanna was always violent.  “We would fight each other. She would hit me, I would hit her and it never was OK,” he said.  “There was always a point where we’d talk about it like, ‘What the f**k are we doing? Like, ‘I don’t like you slapping me.’ If I go on stage I got a scratch on my face and I gotta explain it like, ‘Oh, no I fell.’ If you got a scar or a bruise you gotta put makeup on.  “I’m not ever trying to put my hands on any female.”  Rihanna has not yet publicly responded to Brown’s version of events."

"How sad. Another Hollywood romance allegedly bites the dust. After dating for 9 months, ‘X-Men: First Class’ star Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander have broken up, according to a new report.  Oh no! It seems like the summer of break-ups is not over yet! The latest reported romance to fall apart is the one between Michael Fassbender, 38, and Alicia Vikander, 26. The Steve Jobs star and the Swedish actress have allegedly split after nine months together!    Love is dead! Michael and Alicia have reportedly called it quits, a source tells Us Weekly. Aww, bummer. Alicia and Michael have been together for not even a year. They reportedly first met on the set of their film, The Light Between The Oceans, in late 2014 and sparked a new romance.  The last time Alicia and Michael were photographed together was in May 2015. The two attended the Formula One Grand Prix in Monaco, looking affectionate while posing in front of one of the sports cars. It may just be their romance ran out of gas?  Michael has a reported history of dating his co-stars, according to the Daily Mail. He was involved with his X-Men: First Class co-star, Zoe Kravitz, from 2010 to 2011. Afterward, he later was involved with his fellow Shame star, Nicole Beharie.  Though their romance is allegedly over, both Michael and Alicia’s careers are going strong. In addition to his turn playing the Apple co-creator in Steve Jobs, Michael will reprise his role of Magneto in X-Men: Apocalypse. As for Alicia, she’ll appear opposite Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller in Burnt. She also has been cast in the next Bourne movie, featuring Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones.  Michel and Alicia’s reported split is the latest in a long line of Hollywood break-ups. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced their divorce after a decade together. Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert called it quits. Blake’s The Voice co-star, Gwen Stefani, divorced Gavin Rossdale.

"Muslim convert and would-be domestic terrorist Everitt Aaron Jameson, who planned to carry out a Christmas Day massacre on Pier 39 in San Francisco, was a supporter of Antifa and counted amongst his favourite news organisations CNN, BuzzFeed and Al-Jazeera.The former US Marine was arrested after he told the FBI of his plan to carry out the atrocity, noting that December 25 would be “the perfect day to commit the attack” because Pier 39 would be crowded with people.Media reports confirmed that Jameson “had recently been posting and liking pro-terrorism content on Facebook” and had expressed support for the ISIS-inspired Halloween truck attack in New York. He converted to Islam two years ago.However, what those reports don’t mention is that the would-be terrorist also ‘liked’ numerous Antifa pages, suggesting he supported the movement.Jameson liked Berkeley Antifa, Antifa California, Antifa Scaramento and White Rose Antifa Portland, an archived version of his Facebook profile confirms.He also liked a number of other far-left pages, including ‘Trump Resistance Movement’, ‘Things Trump Supporters Say’, ‘US Democratic Socialists’, ‘Progressive Politics’, and ‘Jeremy Corbyn’.Some of Jameson’s favorite news organisations were The Young Turks, CNN, BuzzFeed and Al Jazeera.

"Robert Pattinson still has ‘a lot of love’ for Kristen Stewart! Does that mean he wants to get back together with her? Get the EXCLUSIVE details!    People LOVE when couples rekindle their romances, but is a reunion in the cards for Kristen Stewart, 27, and Robert Pattinson, 31? The Twilight alums were spotted “hanging out” together on Feb. 11, and we’re hearing that the former couple are on good terms now! “It’s taken a long time to get there, but Rob and Kristen are finally friends again,” a source close to Rob told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Their break-up was so painful for Rob, and he felt so angry and humiliated by Kristen cheating, that at one point he doubted he would ever be able to fully forgive her. But, time heals and Rob’s now managed to put the past behind him and let bygones be bygones.”  But even though the pair have a past with each other, don’t expect them them to be getting together in the future. “Rob and Kristen have so much shared history, they were together during the craziest time in their lives, they pretty much grew up together during the whole Twilight madness, and they really understand each other better than anyone else could. Rob still has a lot of love and respect for Kristen, but it’s evolved from romantic feelings into a deep friendship,” the insider added.  If you’re bummed that Bella and Edward won’t be living the rest of eternity together IRL, listen, I get it. We all are gunning for our faves to rekindle their lost love. Personally, I’m still not over the fact that Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron broke up! But, unfortunately, not every couple is Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber. And also, Kristen herself has said in a monologue on Saturday Night Live that she is “like so gay dude.” She’s currently dating Victoria’s Secret model Stella Maxwell, 27. So yeah, Kristen and Robert aren’t getting back together any time soon, and that’s probably for the best. (And while we’re at it, quit it with the Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston shipping! They’re not getting back together! Stop it!)  HollywoodLifers, what were your thoughts on Kristen and Robert hanging out?"

"There's no need to worry about Ellen DeGeneres' marriage to Portia de Rossi. How do we know? DeGeneres said so herself.  The 55-year-old comedian took some time out of her talk show on Wednesday to address rumors that have surfaced in the last several months suggesting she and de Rossi are split-bound.  ""The other day I was at the hair salon getting these extensions put in,"" DeGeneres joked. ""And there were tabloids all over the hair salon... and on one of them, Portia and I were in the top right-hand corner. And I thought, 'Oh that's so sweet, they're honoring us.' But then I read the headline underneath. And it said, 'Ellen and Portia Marriage Crumbles.' And I was like, 'Oh, what happened? They seemed so happy.' And then I was like, 'Wait, I'm Ellen.' And I should know if that was happening.""  The talk show host's monologue took a more serious turn -- at least for a little while -- when she shot down the rumors.  “It’s so ridiculous to me. There’s not one ounce of truth to any of it. I’m very happily married. In fact, the only thing we ever argue about is who loves who more. That is all. It really is true,"" she said. ""And we argue if we’d let a kangaroo carry us around in its pouch for a year. I would. She wouldn’t. She’ll change her mind. Who wouldn’t want to be in the pouch of a kangaroo for a year? Hopping around. And she’s like 'no' but anyway.”  And if an announcement about some big change in her life ever needs to be made, DeGeneres promised, ""I'll announce it here first.""  DeGeneres and de Rossi married in August 2008 after four years of dating. At the time, the talk show host called herself ""the luckiest girl in the world.""  Keep in touch!

"A lawyer representing the diver who Elon Musk recently accused of being a pedophile said on Wednesday that he sent the Tesla chief a letter that says that he’s preparing to file a libel lawsuit.  The development is the latest twist in the entrepreneur’s turbulent summer on Twitter and comes one day after Musk questioned why the diver hadn’t sued him if his claims were untrue.  “You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? He was offered free legal services,” asked Musk in reply to @Yoda on Twitter.  Also Read: Elon Musk Needled for Tearful NY Times Interview About Having to Work Through His Birthday  Attorney L. Lin Wood, who is representing diver Vernon Unsworth, replied to the thread on Wednesday, saying that Musk “should check his mail before tweeting.”  Musk originally called Unsworth — a diver that criticized Musk’s attempts to help the Thai soccer team trapped in a cave as a “PR stunt” — a “pedo guy” in July. Musk later apologized for his comment, saying it was “spoken in anger.”  Also Read: Elon Musk Says He Won't Take Tesla Private After All  “You published three different tweets to your twenty-two million followers that Mr. Unsworth engages in the sexual exploitation of Thai children, and you did so at a time when he was working to save the lives of twelve Thai children,” Wood said in his letter, dated August 6, to Musk. “You did so without any basis.”  Wood added that he’s prepping a civil libel complaint against Musk.  A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.  Even without a potential civil suit on his hands, it’s already been a controversial month for 47-year-old entrepreneur. Musk is under the regulatory microscope after bringing Wall Street to a halt earlier this summer, tweeting he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private. Musk announced last Friday, after talking to shareholders, to keep Tesla a publicly traded company. Tesla shares have dropped about 20 percent to $305 a share since Musk tweeted about going private."

"Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt‘s split in September 2016 was sudden and shocking — but after an initial flurry of ugly accusations, the couple entered divorce mediation and largely kept their negotiations private.  Now their divorce has exploded into the headlines again as the couple battle over visitation and child support for kids Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox. Here’s a brief history of how things between them got so heated.  Their Shocking Split  Jolie and Pitt were last photographed together in public in July 2016, when they stopped into a Jamba Juice store in L.A. with Shiloh.  On Sept. 19, 2016 Jolie filed for divorce. She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split and asked for physical custody of their six children.  Pitt and Jolie with (from left) Pax, Zahara, Knox, Shiloh and Maddox in May 2014. Charley Gallay/Getty  Troubling Allegations and an Investigation  Pitt was investigated by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services over allegations he got “verbally abusive” and “physical” with one of his children on the pair’s private plane the day before Jolie filed for divorce.  A source told PEOPLE at the time that Pitt “made contact” with Maddox, then 15, in the shoulder area, but Maddox wasn’t injured. “There was a parent-child argument which was not handled in the right way and escalated more than it should have,” the source said.  DCFS concluded its investigation in November. “It was a full and thorough investigation and the determination has been made that no charges should be brought,” a source said at the time, adding that there was no finding of abuse.  An Agreement to Keep the Divorce Private  Starting in October 2016, Pitt was allowed weekly visits, supervised by a therapist, with his youngest kids, a January 2017 court filing revealed. The papers stated that weekly visits of “five hours each” had been scheduled through the end of January. That same month, Jolie and Pitt put out a joint statement saying they had reached an agreement to hash out their divorce confidentially in front of a private judge and “act as a united front.”  Custody Issues Surface  In the following year-plus, the exes kept the peace and got back to their lives. Jolie continued her advocacy work, produced an Oscar-nominated animated movie and resumed acting with Maleficent 2. Pitt starred in and produced numerous movies and started dating, according to source, being seen with MIT professor Neri Oxman in April.  Then in June 2018, their clash over custody wound up surfacing in public court documents. A judge ruled that Jolie could lose primary custody of their kids if she didn’t allow them each to form a “healthy and strong relationship” with Pitt. The judge set a detailed visitation schedule of when Pitt could spend time with the children in London, where Jolie has been filming for the summer, and in L.A. The ruled also granted Pitt unsupervised cell phone contact with the kids.  A spokesperson for Jolie called the public release of the documents “deplorable.”  “From the start, Angelina has been focused only on their health and needs,” the statement to PEOPLE continued, “which is why it was so important that this last court hearing be conducted privately.”  Pitt and Jolie at the 2014 Oscars. Kevin Mazur/WireImage  Pitt and Jolie in 2014.  A Child-Support Spat  Jolie’s attorney Samantha Bley DeJean filed papers on Aug. 7 stating that Pitt “has a duty to pay child support. As of present, [Pitt] has paid no meaningful child support since separation.”  In the documents, Jolie’s lawyer added, “Given the informal arrangements around the payment of the children’s expenses have not been regularly sustained by [Pitt] for over a year and a half, [Jolie] intends to file an RFO [request for a court order] for the establishment of a retroactive child support order.”  In a filing the next day, Pitt’s lawyer Lance Spiegel slammed Jolie’s filing as “unnecessary” and “a thinly-veiled effort to manipulate media coverage.” The filing state that Pitt “loaned” Jolie $8 million to help her purchase her current home and has contributed over $1.3 million “for the benefit of [Jolie] and the minor children.”  Jolie’s lawyer shot back in a statement calling Pitt’s filing “a blatant attempt to obfuscate the truth and distract from the fact that he has not fully met his legal obligations to support the children.” Bley DeJean said Jolie is paying interest on the $8 million loan: “A loan is not, however, child support and to represent it as such is misleading and inaccurate.”"
"One of the Internet’s favorite coupled might have called it quits again.  Chris Evans, 36, and Jenny Slate, 35, are not together anymore after rekindling their relationship late last year, according to a new profile of the Infinity War actor in the New York Times. As Evans recalls a book he read while they were still together, the article states that the two called it off recently. Evans says he learned to listen more while reading Rebecca Solnit’s The Mother of All Questions: “The hardest thing to reconcile is that just because you have good intentions, doesn’t mean it’s your time to have a voice,” the actor, now starring in Lobby Hero on Broadway, told the Times.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The on-again, off-again couple was spotted together again in October 2017 after first breaking up in February following nearly a year of dating. Flirty Twitter exchanges between the two soon followed, sending fans into a frenzy about the possibility of their reunion.  Emma McIntyre/Getty  The rumors gained more steam when Evans posted several videos of his beloved dog appearing to sing along to music while a woman who sounded suspiciously like Slate laughed in the background. PEOPLE later confirmed the rekindling in late November.  Slate spent Christmas with Evans and his family. She posed with his brother Scott for a selfie he posted to Instagram. “Christmas with my favorite Jew!” the look-alike Evans brother captioned the shot.  The former couple met on the set of their drama Gifted in 2016, where sources told PEOPLE their connection was undeniable. When they weren’t busy filming, Evans and Slate would spend much of their free time hanging out together.  Slate gushed about Evans on the The Secret Life of Pets‘ red carpet, telling Entertainment Tonight, “It’s kind of like I got my dream seventh grade boyfriend. We didn’t know each other growing up, but we grew up about a half hour away from each other. We’ve been friends for a while.”  She later opened up about her split from the superhero movie star, saying differences in their careers eventually led to their breakup.  “Chris is a very, very famous person,” she said in a interview with Vulture. “For him to go to a restaurant is totally different than for me to go. I sit in my window and I say ‘Hi’ to people on the street. I have more freedom because I’m not Captain America. I’m mostly a cartoon.”  Slate said the attention eventually became too much.  “This is what I needed to do to feel normal,” she explained. “To be alone.”  RELATED VIDEO: Jenny Slate On What Makes “Gifted” Costar Chris Evans Such A “Beautiful” Human Being  But in the months following their original split, Evans and Slate remained amicable and supportive, often praising each other in the press.  “We all love each other so much, and it’s a real, real love,” Slate told PEOPLE while promoting their film Gifted. “I mean, I have gone on and on about how beautiful Chris is. He is, inside and out.”  Evans echoed her comments, saying she was his “favorite human.”  “She’s the best. I’ve never ever ever met someone in my life who has a mastery of the English language the way she does,” Evans told PEOPLE of Slate. “She’ll give you one sentence and there’s no fat to it. You’re like, ‘You just chose such an unbelievable collection of words that beautifully articulate what you say.’  “It’s like an art form talking with her, because the visuals associated with her expression are just so colorful,” he continued. “She’s so vulnerable, so honest, so interested in other people more than herself, she’s incredibly compassionate, there’s just nothing to not love about her.”"

"Melanie Martinez Rape Accuser Says 'I Had This Sick Need to Protect Her': Report  Former Dresses singer Timothy Heller says that a month before she accused former The Voice star Melanie Martinez of rape, Martinez attempted to get in touch with her after a long period of silence.  In an interview with Newsweek, Heller claims that after she tweeted last month asking ""what if I have my own story of abuse but I'm scared to ruin the persons life and I still love them in a fucked up way and the public really loves them and most probably wouldn't believe me,"" Martinez tried to contact her 20 minutes later, after the two hadn't spoke in more than a year.  On Monday (Dec. 4), Heller posted a lengthy tweet in which she described a night during which she ""repeatedly said no"" to advances from her ""best friend"" Martinez, claiming she kept the secret for years and alleging that Martinez performed oral sex on her and used a sex toy without her consent. Martinez adamantly denied the claims, saying she was ""horrified and saddened"" by them and that ""she never said no to what we chose to do together.""  After Heller's original tweet, she told the magazine, ""I started sobbing when I saw [Melanie] was calling me, and I blocked her."" She also claimed that Martinez attempted to call Heller's boyfriend and texted him several times seeking to get in touch with Heller, whom Martinez said she had recently dreamed about. ""Her fans see her as this angel who understands them,"" Heller told Newsweek. ""So I assumed no one was going to take me seriously if I explained what she did. I've been reading all the #metoo stories, and though I'm obviously in support of the people coming forward, I wasn't sure if my story of being assaulted fit.""  It is one of the rare allegations of sexual assault by a woman in the midst of the torrent of stories surrounding prominent men in entertainment, business, politics and sports assaulting or harassing women that launched the #MeToo movement, which Time Magazine named its Person of the Year on Wednesday (Dec. 6).  Heller's claims about what she says happened that night in June 2015 -- including pictures she gave the magazine of her in a mask and furry handcuffs that were allegedly taken on the night in question -- include her admission of being wracked with guilt for years as the pair remained friends.  ""I think I was invalidating my own experience for so long because she's not a man,"" Heller said. ""Plus, she was my friend, and I sat with what happened in silence because I didn't want to be malicious."" A representative for Martinez told Newsweek that ""Melanie stands by her statement.""

"Melissa Etheridge has revealed that smoking cannabis with her children has brought them closer together.  The GRAMMY-winning singer became an activist for the drug after using it for medicinal purposes during her battle with cancer and says her kids now refer to it as medicine.    WATCH: Melissa Etheridge Says Brad Pitt Was Almost Her Sperm Donor  “My children have a very clear understanding of cannabis,” the 55-year-old mom of four told Yahoo during an interview for their Weed & the American Family report. “When I hold it without shame or confusion they can understand it as simple as if I was pointing to a bottle of Percocet and saying, ‘That’s mama’s medicine.’ You take the naughtiness out of it and it’s not something kids then run to.”  “I have smoked with my older two,” Etheridge continued, referring to 20-year-old daughter Bailey and 18-year-old son Beckett. “It was funny at first and then they realized it’s a very natural end-of-the-day and it brings you closer, so I’d much rather have a smoke with my grown kids than a drink.”  The Kansas native underwent a lumpectomy and several rounds of chemotherapy and radiation after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004. Although doctors prescribed various prescription drugs to help her deal with the side effects of treatment, she took the advice of singer and close pal David Crosby and instead turned to medicinal marijuana.    WATCH: Melissa Etheridge Defends Brad Pitt, Says She ‘Lost a Friend’ When He Married Angelina Jolie  “It was a wake-up call for me,” she said. “When I used it as medicine, it became so clear to me that it has been maligned and misunderstood, and I really wanted to help people who are suffering. Going through chemotherapy is suffering… and cannabis helps so many parts of just that. That’s just the beginning of what it does medicinally.”  “I smoked to be normal. I smoked to be out of pain. I smoked to lighten myself because you’re poisoning yourself with chemo,” she added. “It wasn’t about being high. It was just [getting] to a place where I could communicate with my children, to where I could get up, to where I could eat, where I didn’t have to go to the hospital. It was great medicine.”  Despite beating cancer, Etheridge added that she still gets high today to maintain the “health benefits,” like easing stress and sleeping better.    WATCH: Melissa Etheridge Opens Up About Surviving Breast Cancer  The musician, who is married to Linda Wallem, also noted that the drug has been “the best marital aid.”  ""When it's date night ... it takes down your inhibition; your sexual desires are enhanced,” she said. “We take a bath every night and smoke and talk and wind down and sleep a very, very good night's sleep -- and sleep is extremely important.""  See Etheridge discuss her battle with cancer below."

"Mary J. Blige has been ordered to pay her estranged husband Martin “Kendu” Isaacs $30,000/month in temporary spousal support, according to various reports.  The singer, 46, filed for divorce in July 2016 after 12 years of marriage.

In April, Blige claimed in court documents obtained by PEOPLE that Isaacs spent more than $420,000 during their marriage on “travel charges” that involved his girlfriend, not her.  Blige also claimed that Isaacs drives a Mercedes that she pre-paid the lease on and that he refuses to turn over possession of her “Grammy and other achievement awards.”  WATCH: Hillary Clinton Talks to Mary J.

"Less than three weeks after Andrew Kreisberg, co-creator/executive producer of the CW’s DC series The Flash, Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow and Arrow, was suspended from his duties over allegations of sexual harassment, he has been fired by the studio, Warner Bros TV Group, following an investigation into the accusations.  “After a thorough investigation, Warner Bros Television Group has terminated Andrew Kreisberg’s employment, effective immediately,” the company said in a statement. “We remain committed to providing a safe working environment for our employees and everyone involved in our productions.”  WBTV  Kreisberg has been one of the top lieutenants of Greg Berlanti, architect of the CW DC universe, whose company Berlanti Prods. produces all series. Kreisberg had been hands-on involved in The Flash and Supergirl, serving as co-showrunner on both. Following his exit, Berlanti, co-creator/exec producer of the two series, will step in for him, assuming additional responsibilities on both The Flash, where he will work closely with executive producer/co-showrunner Todd Helbing, and Supergirl, where he will work closely with executive producers/co-showrunners Robert Rovner and Jessica Queller.  “Warner Bros Television Group recently concluded its investigation into the allegations against Andrew Kreisberg,” Berlanti Prods.’ Berlanti and Sarah Schechter said in a statement. “We encouraged and supported this investigation, we believe and support the individuals who came forward, and we agree with the studio’s decision. Nothing is more important to us than the safety and well-being of all our colleagues — coworkers, crew and staff alike.”  As Deadline previously reported, a number of staffers on The Flash and other DC series had complained about Kreisberg’s behavior. On at least one occasion, Kreisberg had interacted with a young female writer on The Flash early in the show’s run in a manner that was described as “inappropriate” and creating “a hostile work environment,” according to a source close to the situation. There had been specific allegations about Kreisberg from at least one other woman. In that case, a director who helmed episodes of Arrow and The Flash, had also complained of similar inappropriate behavior by the executive producer.  Following Kreisberg’s suspension, actors from the CW DC series, including Supergirl and The Flash stars Melissa Benoist and Grant Gustin, spoke out against sexual harassment and in support of the victims.  Meanwhile, E! and Lionsgate TV recently suspended The Royals showrunner Mark Schwahn over sexual harassment allegations by cast and crew members of both his previous show, One Tree Hill, and The Royals."
"If Justin Bieber is your boyfriend, Taylor Swift would let you go! The ""Red"" singer, 24, has distanced herself from former best friend Selena Gomez after the Disney star reconnected with her infamous ex-boyfriend, 20, sources confirm to Us Weekly.  PHOTOS: Justin and Selena's complicated romance  Swift is disgusted that the pair are back together, cutting off her bestie after tweeting just last July that Gomez was ""the closest thing I've ever had to a sister.""  The ""Boyfriend"" singer sent his ex $10,000 in flowers and flew from Miami to McAllen, Texas to see her on March 7. Two days later, the ""Come And Get It"" crooner accompanied the Biebs to the SXSW music fest where he sang his hit ""As Long as You Love Me"" to her.  PHOTOS: Taylor Swift's best surprised faces  But Gomez rekindling of the Jelena flame isn't the only thing peeving Swift. She believes Gomez ""used"" a brief romance with the Grammy winner's pal Ed Sheeran last June to make her jailbird sweetie jealous.  ""After Selena pulled that move, Taylor started distancing herself,"" a source tells Us.  PHOTOS: Justin's biggest scandals  And Swift has plenty of besties to spend time with otherwise. Recently she's been spotted with Modern Family's Sarah Hyland, True Grit's Hailee Steinfeld, Victoria's Secret model Karlie Kloss, and even Gomez's enemy, New Zealander Lorde.

"From Miley Cyrus' secret marriage to her pregnancy, there have been a lot of rumours in the air lately about the Malibu hitmaker's personal life.  Recently her Thanksgiving tweet sparked speculation about the songstress being pregnant which apparently drove her so crazy that she took to Twitter to retweet the picture and addressed all the rumours.  Also read: Miley Cyrus pregnant? Malibu singer has a hilarious response to the baby bump rumours  She wrote: ""RUDE!!! Not pregnant just eating a s— ton of tufurkey.""  Even after that, Hollywood Life reported that the Wrecking Ball singer wanted to get 'pregnant ASAP' with fiance Liam Hemsworth.  An insider reportedly told the website, ""Miley's totally ready to start a family with Liam.""  Although she did not appreciate the speculations that she was pregnant ""because it is something she has thought about for a while that hasn't happened yet.""  RUDE!!! Not pregnant just eating a shit ton of tufurkey pic.twitter.com/rjNjquxvLb — Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) November 23, 2017  The source reiterated: ""She wants to be married, she wants to start a family but Liam isn't 100% ready for all of that just yet. She can only hint about it so much.""  Hence those kinds of baby bump rumours have driven her crazy ""because she would want nothing more than for those rumours to be true.""  ""Miley is just waiting for Liam to be just as ready as she has become. She knows that it is all in time but if it was up to her, she would love to speed up the process,"" the source also told Hollywood LIfe.  But as usual, Gossip Cop exposed the truth behind all these speculations and claimed that the insider's statement is entirely fabricated.  Given that, the Hollywood Life's report looks contrary to its own insider's statements. While Miley herself rubbished all the pregnancy rumours on Twitter during Thanksgiving, how is it possible that she told the insider about her willingness to get pregnant?  Besides this, the songstress clarified in a radio interview a few months back that she is in no rush to have kids. Talking to 104.3 Myfm, Cyrus said, ""No, I love pigs more than kids, to be honest.""  Thus it is quite clear that the story about Cyrus wanting to ""get pregnant ASAP"" and ""have babies with Hemsworth"" is entirely made up."

"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding at St. George’s Chapel is only a few short weeks away at this point (May 19), and Kensington Palace is keeping the public updated on all the latest details, including her parents’ roles in the wedding.  Press Secretary Jason Knauf announced that Markle will not have a Maid of Honor because she “has a very close-knit circle of friends and she didn’t want to choose one over another.”  The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now  Many royal wedding enthusiasts had their sights set on Markle’s future sister-in-law Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge as the Maid of Honor. Others speculated that if the maid of honor title didn’t fall on Kate Middleton, it would have gone to Markle’s friend Jessica Mulroney. According to Vanity Fair, Mulroney is Meghan Markle’s “secret wedding planner” and one of her best friends.  Although Markle will not have a Maid of Honor, Prince William and Kate Middleton’s children Prince George and Princess Charlotte are expected to have official roles during the ceremony. George and Charlotte were a page boy and bridesmaid at Aunt Pippa Middleton’s wedding in 2017. Newborn royal baby Prince Louis Arthur Charles is probably too young to be a page boy.  On April 26, Kensington Palace announced that Prince William will serve as Prince Harry’s Best Man, just like the Harry did for his brother’s wedding in 2011.  Contact us at editors@time.com."

"Caitlyn Jenner has undergone a physical milestone in her transition.  In her new memoir, The Secrets of My Life, the gold medal-winning Olympian–who confirmed her transition from male to female and revealed her new identity as Caitlyn in June 2015–says that she underwent gender reassignment surgery in January 2017, PEOPLE has confirmed.  “The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated,” she writes in the memoir, according to RadarOnline, calling the decision to undergo the surgery “complex.”  Jenner says she decided to be open about the surgery in order to stop the questions and inquiries about when — or if — she would have it done.  “I am telling you because I believe in candor,” she says. “So all of you can stop staring. You want to know, so now you know. Which is why this is the first time, and the last time, I will ever speak of it.”  RELATED VIDEO: Caitlyn Jenner Considered Sex Change in 1985, Ex-Wife Linda Thompson Reveals  “I just want to have all the right parts.

"A dispute in Angela Merkel’s coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship.The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader’s own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor’s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent’s struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That’s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel’s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it’s hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn’t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party’s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It’s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany’s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.Split on the rightThe CDU and the CSU are sister parties, with a joint parliamentary caucus and electoral program. Think of the CSU as the center-right’s Bavarian chapter — the CDU operates in all of Germany’s 16 states except Bavaria.So a breach would be drastic, but not unprecedented. In 1976, CSU chairman Franz-Josef Strauss called off the joint caucus, but the split was short-lived. For the Bavarians, going it alone would theoretically open a path for the CDU to campaign in Bavaria, weakening the CSU’s position.A hoax tweet that rattled markets on Friday raised exactly that possibility. It presented a fake quote from the CDU state premier of Hesse, Volker Bouffier, as saying his party should prepare to set up a Bavarian chapter for the next national election. Merkel’s chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, quickly stepped in to say the report was invented. “We should all remain calm,” he said."

"Beyonce is just one of many celebrities who has admitted to being demon possessed and worshipping Satan. Be aware of what your kids are being exposed to.  “Right before I performed for the BET awards, I raised my hands up and it was the first time I felt something else come into me. I knew that was going to be my coming out night at the award show,” explained Beyonce in a recent interview. Satan works overtime to deceive the masses through none other than the entertainment industry. Satanism is being promoted by hundreds of celebrities and we are blindly idolizing the very people who are Satan worshippers.  When speaking at a music festival in Wisconsin last week, a man standing in the back of the packed room, loudly confirmed my information regarding Beyonce and her demonic influence over our kids. I mean, who would just randomly YouTube search “celebrities who practice Satanism.” Well, I did and I was shocked. Check it out for yourself. At first, I just wanted to confirm what I had seen first hand while working in LA and verify some of the stories friends shared with me who had the 411 from the inside. What I discovered was shocking!  Back to Beyonce. This chick is one of the most powerful influencers of adults and children alike. However, many people don’t know that she has admitted countless times that she is possessed by a spirit guide she named Sasha Fierce. In Russian the meaning of Sasha is: defender of man. Deceptive, isn’t it? What she is promoting is deceiving man not defending man. Satan is the great deceiver. He twists the truth and she is one of his instruments.  What does possession mean? Possession is when a spirit or soul hijacks a body and takes over the function and control of that body. The person possessed is not consciously present and will usually have no memory of the actions that happened while possessed. Beyonce talks about how she’s a relatively reserved young woman but says, “When I see videos of myself on stage and on TV, I am like, ‘Who is that girl? That’s not me!’ I wouldn’t dare do that!” Beyonce is possessed.  Click here to see a photo that shows Beyonce wearing the emblem of a goat’s head during a photo shoot. This symbol is used exclusively for Satanic worship. Millions of fans are actually worshipping Satan when engaging in her music, watching her videos and trying to copy her “dance moves” without even knowing it! The reason this is so alarming is because music has been scientifically proven to be one of the most powerful medians for communicating a message. It bypasses the brain and goes straight to our emotions, thought-process, subconscious and the heart of the listener. Satan is using the music industry to lead many people astray. Here’s a clip that’s a must see to give you an in-depth look at Beyonce and how her demonic possession affects her millions of followers.  Sadly, Beyonce is just one of many celebrities who is working on behalf of Satan and encouraging us to follow and practice Luciferianism. It’s that serious. Katy Perry, Britney Spears, Fergie, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, Justin Timberlake, Kanye West and Jay-Z are some of the other more well known, professing Satanists. For example, Fergie states, “The Devil comes and soon my conscious and unconscious might start to brawl as this cunning Demon takes me as it’s voodoo doll.” Katy Perry explains, “I swear I wanted to be the Amy Grant of music, but it didn’t work out and so I sold my soul to the devil.” Nicki Minaj has said in the past that there’s a crazy boy named Roman who lives in her and says things she would never say. She has told him to leave but he resists and she said he’s in her for a reason. Justin Timberlake boastfully announced, “All you people out there, Satan is my master. He has always been.” As you can see, many stars tell their fans just who they follow. Are we listening?  Do we catch celeb’s words when they describe their involvement with the occult? We need to be educated on what role models we should follow so that we are not pulled into the devastating, deceitful destruction of demonic possession. Satan is attacking the masses with his lies and using the entertainment industry to carry out his plan. The word “industry’ means “production and construction.” What is Hollywood producing as a result of millions of fans idolizing celebrities who are promoting this message? The more research you do in regards to Satanism in the industry, the more your eyes will be opened and the dots will start to connect.

"It’s International Women’s Day, and we should all be celebrating — especially this year. Why? 2018 has been a productive one for women, thanks to the actresses, journalists, athletes and other survivors who bravely shared their experiences with sexual assault, as well as Hollywood’s historic launch of Time’s Up, a movement stars like Big Little Lies‘ Laura Dern has been supporting since its inception this awards season.  “Many of us were taught not to tattle. It was a culture of silencing and that was normalized,” Laura Dern shared of women, at the 2018 Golden Globes, adding that we should all aim to instill confidence in younger generations. “I urge all of us to not only support survivors and bystanders who are brave enough to tell their truth, but to promote restorative justice. May we teach our children that speaking out without the fear of retribution is our culture’s new north star.”  Hollywood stars have certainly continued to take note of the positive changes, and have taken to their respective social media accounts to pay tribute to the progress made on International Women’s Day.

"Meghan Markle is counting the days until her royal wedding to Prince Harry. But even as Meghan joyfully prepares for her walk down the aisle and marriage to royalty, Markle reportedly is finding herself haunted by ghosts from her past. Ranging from Meghan’s former best friend, Ninaki Priddy, who allegedly betrayed Markle in a shocking way to jealous relatives and a possibly hostile ex-husband, those “ghosts” are darkening Meghan’s wedding plans, according to E! News.  Meghan Markle Reportedly Is Faced With Individuals From Her Past Who Want To Wreck Her Wedding Plans  While most of the people in Markle’s life are thrilled about her marriage to Prince Harry, some of those “ghosts” from her past are tormenting her, according to the publication.  “A few [individuals] seem hell-bent on trying to ruin the big [wedding] day. The torment Meghan Markle must be going through, thanks to a best friend from hell, jealous family members and a former spouse, is unimaginable.”  With a mere six weeks until Meghan and Harry tie the knot, the public Markle is focused on tasks such as getting fitted for her wedding dress, taking royal etiquette classes, and figuring out the politically charged seating arrangements. But it’s the behind-the-scenes antics that are reportedly the most intriguing.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot on Saturday, May 19, in St. George's Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle. Featured image credit: Chris Jackson Getty Images  Meghan Markle’s Brand Gets Makeover: Two “Ghosts” Get Killed Off  As an actress, Meghan was viewed as a brand with a distinctive voice, including her popular social media accounts. But as Markle prepares to become a duchess and member of the royal family, she is having to reinvent that brand. Meghan was fond of her social media platforms, sources told E! News, but now she must follow in Prince William’s, Kate Middleton’s, and Prince Harry’s footsteps. The trio use the same @KensingtonRoyal handle, and Markle’s appearances with Harry now are reported on Twitter with that handle.  null  Initially, Meghan’s social media platforms, including Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, were among the ghosts who haunted her. But those platforms, as well as her lifestyle website, the Tig, have been deleted.  In addition to social media, Markle’s style when she dated Prince Harry first reflected her old life. Short skirts, ripped jeans, and low necklines turned heads as she stepped out with a member of royalty. But just as she deleted her social media, Meghan has laid to rest her actress-era fashion.  “Gone [are Meghan Markle’s] short skirts and low necklines from her red-carpet days, replaced by more demure outfits of pants, skirts with longer hemlines, tailored coats and even a fashion-forward beret. Meghan 2.0 now looks every inch a style-conscious-yet-sensibly attired member of the regal elite.”  While Markle was able to deal with the end of her personal social media accounts, her website, and her former fashion in private, the people who form the “ghosts” in her life haven’t stopped haunting her.  Meghan Markle’s “Ghosts” Include People Who Betrayed Her  E! News pointed to Meghan’s half-sister, Samantha, as an example of one of the ghosts from Markle’s past who she can’t escape. Markle’s relative alleged that Markle had always wanted to be a princess, labeling her a social climber. Samantha even began penning a memoir titled The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister and announced plans for a reality show.  One of the most hurtful “ghosts” from Meghan’s past, and the most shocking, however, is her former best friend, Ninaki Priddy. For 30 years, the two were like sisters, from growing up together to Priddy’s role as the maid of honor at Markle’s wedding to Hollywood producer Trevor Engleson.  null  But as invitations to Meghan and Harry’s wedding are issued, Markle has been wounded by Ninaki spilling her secrets, pointed out E! News.  “When [Meghan Markle’s former best friend] Ninaki started to spill stories of their intimate conversations, it was a betrayal that must have felt like a stab in the heart to Meghan. Ninaki [claims] she is a calculating manipulator who was so obsessed with Princess Diana she made it her aim to marry Di’s son.”  Markle’s concerns about what might be revealed or alleged about her past don’t end with the betrayal from her best friend, however. Biographer Andrew Morton, known for infuriating the Palace with his book Diana: Her True Story, is set to publish his version of Meghan’s life. Morton reportedly will portray Markle as intensely ambitious, driven to become a member of the royal family.  There’s one person in Meghan’s life who supports her, and that’s her future husband, Prince Harry. Harry previously said that when he found the right woman, he would “ensure we get to the point where we are actually comfortable with each other before the massive invasion into her privacy.” With that “invasion” currently taking place, it’s thought that Prince Harry will stand by Meghan no matter what those ghosts claim about his beloved bride."
"The Kardashian baby daddy drama continues, except this time, the spotlight is on Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. (Move over, Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson!) With Kanye's behavior growing more erratic by the second, no one can blame the mother-of-three for wanting a divorce.  According to Life & Style, Kim believes Kanye is too focused on his career right now, and she's ""done with her husband always putting himself first."" When the rapper announced he'll be dropping two new albums in June, it was the final straw.  Trouble is, Kim and Kanye have kids in the mix — North, 4, Saint, 2, and Chicago, three months — who make the situation all the more complicated. “Kim is pissed that [Kanye will] be off traveling the world promoting his music while she’s left at home feeling like a single mom with three small kids,” the source explained. “She accuses Kanye of being selfish."" Kanye definitely doesn't see things that way. In fact, he “disagrees and blames ‘selfish’ Kim for their issues,” noted the source. “He doesn’t believe Kim is always there for him.”  Despite the 40-year-old's reservations about his wife's support, Kim has been on Team Kanye since the beginning — making his claims all the more outlandish. Even after her sisters Kylie, Khloé, and Kourtney all unfollowed Kanye on Twitter for his Trump-loving rant, she defended him.  In fact, Kim didn't just risk family, but friends too! John Legend and wife Chrissy Teigen both unfollowed Kanye in the wake of his ""MAGA"" tweets, Pedestrian reports, as did Harry Styles, Kendrick Lamar, Rihanna, Teyana Taylor, and Travis Scott.  While the KKW Beauty mogul was willing to put up with Kanye's antics then, she's had enough. With two young children and an infant at home, it's just gotten out of hand.

"Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani have been going strong since they began dating in November 2015, and apparently their romance has been hot and heavy since the beginning!  The 41-year-old country singer was joined onstage by Stefani for an intimate concert at his Ole Red Tishomingo venue in Oklahoma Friday night. The event — which was thrown for 150 lucky fans to benefit J.C. Reaching Out, a local charity that provides assistance to family members of people battling cancer — was a prelude to Saturday’s block party, which will officially open the venue.  In between songs like “Neon Light,” “A Guy with a Girl,” “The Baby,” “Every Time I Hear That Song,” and fittingly, “Ol’ Red,” Shelton joked about the origins of their relationship — explaining they “started hanging out together and messing around.”  Kevin Mazur/WireImage  His admission had Stefani, whose oldest sons Zuma, 8, and Kingston, 10, were in the audience, shook. In video captured of the moment and shared online by her fans, Stefani can be seen lifting her head from Shelton’s shoulder and flashing him a shocked expression.  But Shelton, with the cheers of the audience behind him, quickly recovered from the apparent snafu. “You know, texting each other,” he said.  Good morning. I love Gwen and Blake so much!💕 pic.twitter.com/V2rT8nDFmf — Laura (@BSxGS) September 30, 2017  B: ""We were just starting to hang out and mess around""  G: 😮😊😊 pic.twitter.com/fIwKWKLBmU — Cat 😽✨ (@izzle284) September 30, 2017  Shelton and Stefani, 47, met as coaches on The Voice and started dating not long after Shelton’s divorce from fellow country crooner Miranda Lambert and Stefani’s divorce from husband Gavin Rossdale.  They’ve been inseparable ever since. From red carpet appearances and on-stage performances to their undying support of one another from a distance and their sweet selfies, the pair are a match made in heaven — blending their families together, sharing holidays, and even collaborating on songs including “Go Ahead and Break My Heart” (off of Shelton’s album, If I’m Honest), and “You Make It Feel Like Christmas” (the title track of Stefani’s upcoming Christmas album).

Everybody loves Blake, and that’s the thing. There’s no way around it. He’s just a sparkly like happy, amazing person.”"
"Read original article hereLiberals sure are afraid of Roy Moore. Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she’s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn’t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore “groped her in the alley behind the” church they both attended in 1957. “It was the most horrifying moment of my life,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. “Roy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,” she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.Maddow then interviewed Dourif’s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn’t say anything until he was running for Senator because they “feared for their lives.” Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion “she” and her “husband” Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that “Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.”“Why would Barack and Michelle Obama’s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office – someone of the opposing party,” Johnson writes. “This stinks more than Malia Obama’s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.”What exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source."

Sharon accentuated her age-defying appearance as she worked her blonde locks into a tousled coif and sported minimal make-up.

"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, “This is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.”According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website."
"Ellen DeGeneres — after a fight to end all fights that climaxed with Ellen ripping off her wedding ring — has fled the marital home she shares with Portia de Rossi , and multiple sources have claimed the stage is set for a blockbuster $400 million divorce! Photo credit: Getty Images/InStar  The National ENQUIRER has learned Ellen left In a bombshell world exclusive,has learned Ellen left the couple’s love nest and has agreed to an off-listing sale of the marital estate they bought together just eight months ago! Photo credit: Mega  “It’s all very shady and ominous. Ellen went to great lengths to keep the news from their close friends to avoid being asked questions,” an insider claimed. “She and Portia were fighting more and more. Eventually, what normally would have been a routine back-and-forth turned nasty .” Photo credit: Mega  Ellen has publicly insisted the couple’s marriage is on solid ground. But sources have exclusively told The ENQUIRER the pair have been spending nights alone, and now they appear to be living completely apart. Photo credit: Mega  Property records show Ellen and Portia — who will be married for ten years on Aug. 16 — maintained two separate residences on the six-acre equestrian estate in exclusive Montecito, Calif., which recently sold for $11 million. Photo credit: Files  In yet another clue to their marital woes , just weeks after they paid $7.2 million for the sprawling property last September, Ellen quietly snapped up a place of her own nine miles away in Carpinteria! Photo credit: Files  Sources claimed the $77 million-a-year TV chatterbox is holed up at this $18.6 million beachfront mansion, which she secretly purchased in October 2017. “It didn’t bode well for the long term when Ellen bought that home,” a source claimed. Photo credit: Mega  The talk-show host is a notorious house-flipper — investing in properties before cashing out when the real-estate market heats up. But according to sources, her recent spree is less about the money and more about having separate residences as she and Portia inch closer toward officially separating. Photo credit: Mega  “They spend less and less time together ,” said one source. “In fact, they’ve been living separate lives. It’s gotten so bad that they hardly say a word to each other all day.” Photo credit: Mega  “Portia feels neglected and mistreated,” another insider told The ENQUIRER. “She feels as if she supports Ellen in everything she does, while Ellen just gets aggravated and judgmental when it comes to her needs.” Photo credit: Mega  If they do announce a divorce, it promises to be one of the most expensive in Hollywood history! “With their combined fortune, future earnings and property totaling $400 million, it’ll be a good day to be their divorce lawyers!” claimed an insider.

But The ENQUIRER’s mole fears the worst as Portia continues to spend days alone at her own $17.3 million bolt-hole in Beverly Hills. Photo credit: Mega  “It’s usually Portia who walks out whenever they fight,” the insider claimed. “Ellen has a great TV personality, but at home she’s a bore who goes to bed every night at nine.” “Arrested Development” star Portia has also complained Ellen cares more about her fur-shedding cats and dogs, said the source.

"CLOSE Among her many unforgettable qualities, Diana was known for her fabulous style. From ditching her gloves to speaking to the people through her clothing, Diana's flawless style lives on. USA TODAY  Princess Diana and her mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II in London, August 4, 1987. (Photo: Associated Press)  Princess Diana mystified and irked the British royals in life, but in death she changed them in ways that strengthened the monarchy by making them seem a bit more like her — warm, approachable, human.  Exhibit A has to be the 2012 London Olympics when Queen Elizabeth II, then 86 and celebrating 60 years on her throne, participated in an extraordinary video skit to open the Games, featuring James Bond actor Daniel Craig and ""the queen"" as a Bond girl skydiving from a helicopter into Olympic Stadium. Mouths dropped, especially those of her grandchildren, as tens of thousands of Brits watching cheered and roared.  RELATED: Princess Diana remembered  ""Would she have done that cameo had it not been for Diana, all those years earlier, who emboldened them to do things in a fresh way and be more relatable?"" says American biographer Sally Bedell Smith, who's written best-sellers about both the queen and Diana.  The Princess of Wales' feelings about the Windsors were as mercurial as she was, toggling between awe and admiration to rage and despair during the years she was the desperately unhappy wife of Prince Charles and the daughter-in-law of the queen and Prince Philip.  As the queen herself said at the time, there were ""lessons to be drawn"" from the story of Diana, and these are now apparent, says British PR consultant and royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams.  ""Diana's more approachable, endearing and emotional style, her conviction that the royal family had no heart, the way she appealed to the public in (interviews), all this was unique but had real impact,"" Fitzwilliams says. ""It is a tribute to the resilience of the Windsors that they have made certain changes yet kept the monarchy's mystique.""  Despite her troubles with her in-laws, Diana said she wanted to bolster the ties between the monarchy and the people; she was, after all, the mother of a future king.  ""It's vital the monarchy keeps in touch with the people — it's what I try to do,"" she told former Times editor Peter Stothard at a lunch in 1994, according to Phil Dampier's new collection of Diana quotes, Diana: I'm Going to Be Me.  British royal reporter and broadcaster Katie Nicholl, author of several royal biographies, says Diana broke the royal mold: She did and said things considered ""very un-royal"" that had a positive effect, especially in the way her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, were raised to be aware of life beyond palace walls.  ""As they have said in recent interviews they are the princes and the men they are today largely because of the way Diana raised them and the things that she exposed them to from an early age,"" Nicholl says.  Queen Elizabeth and other members of Britain's royal family bow their heads as Princess Diana's casket moves slowly past the gates of Buckingham Palace in London, Sept. 6, 1997. (Photo: Associated Press/BBC TV)  ""There is a rawness in these interviews, an openness that Diana would have approved,"" says Fitzwilliams. ""The princes are following directly in her footsteps.""  Diana campaigned for ""politically sensitive"" causes not previously connected to the royals, including AIDS, homelessness and landmines — issues that touched real people and people who had no voice, Nicholl says.  ""Ultimately, this was all very positive for the royal family even though the queen and others were concerned at points that some of the issues Diana was campaigning for weren’t synonymous with what royals should be doing,"" Nicholl says. ""To the people, Diana was seen as in touch. She was a princess, but one who wasn’t afraid to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in and that did the royal family a huge amount of good.""  No doubt the 1,000-year-old British monarchy already knew a thing or two about keeping in touch with the people (to do otherwise risked execution and exile over the centuries), but it was Diana — equal parts beguiling and bewildering — whose shocking death helped remind them of this fundamental survival skill.  After she was killed in a Paris car crash in 1997, an almost-as-shocking tsunami of grief washed over Britain and the world, and nearly swamped the royals.  Tucked away at their usual summer bastion of Balmoral, their vast estate in Scotland, they were unprepared for the unprecedented reaction back in London: The hysteria, the headlines, the 24/7 media coverage. Also, the persistent importuning, from then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and many others, that the queen return, respond to the public grief, and put on a semi-royal funeral for Diana.  ""The queen has an unchanging style which has been perfection; the death of Diana was the one occasion where reliance on tradition and precedent were not appropriate and Blair was fortunately there to advise her,"" Fitzwilliams says.  The queen met all the demands and more, after first balking. She rose to the occasion with a stirring live speech to the nation (a rarity) before the funeral in which she paid tribute to Diana.  Queen Elizabeth II speaks from Buckingham Palace to pay tribute to Princess Diana, on Sept. 5, 1997. (Photo: AP)  In deed and metaphor, the queen bowed her head to Diana's coffin, and it was sincere. Diana was no longer a member of the royal family, and she had behaved in obnoxious ways in the years before her 1996 divorce, but she was still the mother of the queen's young grandsons; this was a gesture no loving grandmother would withhold.  ""Diana had a real effect on the monarchy,"" Smith says. ""They realized, in their practical and efficient way, that Diana had touched people in a special way, in accessibility and informality. They commissioned research, polling, focus groups, and they responded, not in a dramatic way, but in an incremental way. The queen did things a little more informally, she loosened protocol.""  Immediately, public opinion about the queen and her family swung back to its previous high levels. In the years since Diana's death, the royals have been more popular than ever, culminating in extravagant displays of affection for the queen during her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 and for her 90th birthday in 2016.  Even Prince Charles and his second wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the longtime mistress Diana blamed for her marital woes, are popular (if only because they are not as widely despised as they were in 1997).  Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry inspect floral tributes to Princess Diana outside Kensington Palace, Sept. 5, 1997. (Photo: DAVID BRAUCHLI, Associated Press)  Victoria Arbiter, daughter of the queen's former press secretary and a royal commentator for CNN in New York, says ""little glimpses of Diana"" are everywhere apparent today. But she also gives credit to the queen.  ""You can't take anything away from the queen and her ability to adapt and evolve and meet the needs of the people at any one time,"" Arbiter says. ""Diana should be credited with many changes, one of which is the royal family is very much more hands on. They're getting much more involved on a visceral level as a result of Diana.""  Society's expectations have changed, Arbiter says. The deference and formality associated with the royals are disappearing. You might not see the queen sipping tea in a Starbucks, but she's no longer quite as remote as she once was.  ""It's been slow, gradual change,"" Arbiter says, ""and Diana was definitely the trigger.""      .  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2xNwLFP"

"So Kim Kardashian is set to appear on Ellen today, which means she’ll be the first family member to finally let everyone know what’s up with Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson’s relationship. That is, if they even have one anymore.  To jog your memory, Khloé just gave birth to a baby girl named True and in the same week that happened, rumors of Tristan’s alleged affairs surfaced. Kim and other members of the Kardashian-Jenner family had flown out to Cleveland, Ohio to be by Khloé’s side when she gave birth, and Kim is graciously sharing what it’s been like ever since.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  In a sneak-peek released last week, Kim said it's not going that great for the youngest Kardashian sister.  In Kim’s interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Kim said, ""Like, I don’t even know how to describe it besides it’s just so f*cked up."" Indeed it is, Kim.  And in the full interview clip, Kim said Khloé is taking some time for herself and True and isn't making any hasty decisions about her and Tristan's relationship.  According to Kim, Khloé is currently alone in Cleveland to have time to bond with her baby and is still on the fence about whether or not she and Tristan will stay together.  ""You know, I think she’s not thinking of anything,"" Kim said. ""I think she just wants a clear head and just wants to be alone with her baby and figure that out and the family’s flown out there a few times.""  She went on to say, ""I think it must be so hard to have your heart broken and fall in love all in a day or two, all happening at the same time and I think she just needs some [space].""  Kim said her whole family is just trying to be supportive of Khloé.  ""We really were rooting for Khloé, and we still are. She's so strong and she's doing the best that she can. It's a really sad situation all over.""  The only thing she didn't talk about was if she ever liked Tristan.  When Ellen asked her about her opinion of Tristan, Kim danced around the question and threw some shade toward him.  ""I kind of made this rule with my brother, if there's a baby involved, I'm not going to talk. I'm going to keep it cute and keep it classy and not talk too bad. I'm going to try not to say anything so negative because one day True is going to see this.""

"We all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything, crawl back to bed under a layer of blankets and live there until we feel better. We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it’s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.If you’re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you’re prepared for.NASA has put out an ad looking for people who’re willing to take part in their “Rest Studies” – a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.So what is the exact purpose of these studies?These studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts’ health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.The Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:Examining how the astronauts’ changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.Examining if the astronauts’ physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The study’s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.The exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.The entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you’re in the exercising or non-exercising group.Once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you’ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you’ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You’ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.During the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body’s immunity system.But is it worth it?You may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can’t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.This will probably be your only opportunity to say that you’ve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.Source:http://mysteriousearth.net"

"[This story contains spoilers from the March 14 episode of The X-Files.]    When first-time The X-Files scribe Karen Nielsen wrote Wednesday’s episode, “Nothing Lasts Forever,” she set out to tell a character-based piece.  “I wanted to have some character moments with Mulder and Scully — that was super important to me,” says Nielsen. “I thought it would be interesting to have Scully reflecting on her religion. My sister is very Catholic, and I’m not. So I liked the dynamic of Scully being very Catholic and Mulder not; I related to that.”    What Nielsen didn’t know at the time was that her episode would shift back one to become the penultimate episode of the season and potentially the series as a whole. Wednesday's episode revolved around a cult led by a former actress (Fiona Vroom) who was obsessed with maintaining their youth and the woman (Carlena Britch) trying to save her sister from them. The installment also could be the last “monster of the week” episode the iconic series does with its core team intact as star Gillian Anderson has said this will be her final year playing Scully.  “The pressure that society puts on women to be perfect, to be beautiful is intense, because we’re such a consumerism society that we have to prey off of women’s insecurity to sell, sell, sell,” Nielsen says. The writer, who doubles as the show's script coordinator, also made sure the female characters were well-rounded and the episode also featured an inclusive cast. “Especially in Hollywood, you’re a write-off after 30. That pressure is quadrupled as an actress. That was a horrible and wonderful rabbit hole to go down [in writing]: having an actress try to hold on to her youth and obtaining that.”  Nielsen credits longtime X-Files writers James Wong (who directed the hour) and Glen Morgan with being the genesis of Scully’s (Gillian Anderson) religious origin story in the episode. When Scully was younger, her brother was sick, and her mother asked the family to pray for him. The first few days, a young Scully asked for a puppy … which she got shortly after her brother recovered. “It was the architecture of Jim and Glen knowing this character for so long, and seeing the things that she should be coming from,” she says, calling the duo her “dream team” collaborators. Morgan was also the one to suggest they have a visual callback to the mysterious coin Scully’s mother had on her when she died last season.    The hour ended up being pivotal for Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully, whose relationship has grown increasingly murky. The dynamic duo’s partnership was always complicated during the original run of the series: after years of closeness, they slept together in season seven — a move that appeared to be responsible for the conception of Scully’s son, William — but due to outside forces (and Duchovny’s increased absence from the franchise) they were never properly a couple. The second feature film, The X-Files: I Want to Believe, found the two living together, away from the FBI life, but there was obvious tension in the relationship as they worked the movie’s case; they were broken up by the 2016 television revival.    However, they appeared to potentially reconcile early in season 11, when they slept together and arranged a couple of dates. But in true Mulder and Scully fashion, they simply seemed to be existing together (they still reside in separate homes, for instance) versus actively engaging the shift in their relationship and what it could mean. But Scully took a step forward to break them out of their standstill in the final scene of the episode: when Mulder mentioned they were good together, she simply asked, “Are we together?”  “To me it was about having a honest moment,” Nielsen says, acknowledging the open conversation between the two was part of why the episode moved directly pre-finale. “We need to be real, we need to be honest, we need to start saying something. They’ve gone through so many emotional things with their son, coming back to the X-Files and things not going so smoothly. And [also] coming back to the relationship, because they were away from it for so long; to see where that relationship sits now. It’s exhausting not being honest when you get to that stage. To be true to these characters, you had to have a true moment. It’s what those characters needed.”    But what was it that Scully needs? ""I don’t know if any God is listening, but I am standing right here,” Mulder told his partner. “And I am listening. Right besides you, all ears. That’s my choice.” She paused, looked around at the empty church, before whispering her hope for her future in his ear. “That’s not my 4-year-old self looking for a miracle,” she said. “That’s my leap of faith forward. And I’d like to do it together.”    The audience is in the dark about Scully’s request during the hour, intentionally. “That’s between Mulder and Scully,” Nielsen notes. “Having those private moments, it’s important for any couple.” And it won’t be revealed going forward, either: “It’ll always be between Mulder and Scully,” she says with a laugh. “It’s not for anyone else. That was their moment.” (Chalk it up to another unsolved mystery, a la the duo’s Christmas gifts to each other.)  With that exact sentiment remaining unspoken, it was essential the tone be handled correctly while filming the scene. “It’s just [them] being honest with each other,” Nielsen notes. “When you’re used to having that playful banter with someone, when they’re suddenly honest, it takes you aback. It’s, ‘Oh, we’re actually going to have a real conversation about this.’ Sometimes those things can be scary. It was something from the heart, which can be terrifying for her to do, especially given how much she’s been through and how much her heart has been broken, especially this season. That’s where I wanted it to come from: her vulnerability.”    And, yes, in Nielsen’s mind, Mulder and Scully are meant to be together. “I feel like they’re each other’s soulmates and they know it,” she says. “They get in each other’s way, they’re complicated, they both have reasons why they hold back. They both have reasons they need each other. That’s why they’ve had such an up and down relationship: it’s not as easy as saying, ‘I like you, let’s make this work.’ The world they live in just doesn’t allow for that. Their love for each other, mind and body, makes them go, ‘There’s nobody else.’ There are so many moments you see them, they look at each other, and just from a look, [it’s] no one will get me like you do. That’s my personal take on it: they’re soulmates.”    What do you think Scully whispered to Mulder?"

"Ming Xi Breaking Down in Tears After Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show Fall She took a tumble while on the catwalk in Shanghai.  Model Ming Xi took a tumble during the 2017 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, which was filmed on Nov. 20. Originally, it was reported that the fall would not be televised, but it was shown on Tuesday night’s CBS broadcast, reports E News. It appears that the 28-year-old model got tangled in her flowing, sheer ensemble.  But the Chinese model was a total pro, and did not let the fall affect her on stage. She kept a smile on the whole time, and even seemed to laugh at herself as she adjusted her hair and continued to walk down the catwalk.

"Miles Teller Busted for Public Drunkenness Uncooperative with Cops  Miles Teller Arrested For Being Drunk and Uncooperative In Public (UPDATE)  EXCLUSIVE  2:08 PM PT -- Miles just tweeted, ""Went down to SD to see my buddy before he deployed. I wasn't arrested I was detained bc there was no evidence to charge me with a crime.""  For the record, the San Diego PD tells TMZ Miles was arrested and booked for misdemeanor public intoxication. They also took a mug shot. Miles Teller was arrested early Sunday morning after he was literally falling down drunk and refusing to cooperate with cops ... law enforcement sources tell TMZ.  Teller was partying with a group of guys in San Diego when an officer noticed the actor was having trouble standing on the sidewalk. We're told the cop walked up to Miles and started questioning him, but he quickly became uncooperative.  Our sources say that's when Teller lost his balance and almost fell into a traffic lane. The cop cuffed him, and Miles had trouble standing in one spot.  Now the turning point. San Diego offers a detox program where cops will take someone who is drunk to a center run by volunteers. The center has cots where someone can stay for 4 hours and sleep it off. The cop offered to take Miles there but we're told he refused.  At that point Miles could have been arrested, but cops still took him to the detox center ... hoping he'd cooperate. That didn't happen. We're told he refused to follow directions so the staff rejected him.  At that point, Miles was arrested for being drunk in public ... a misdemeanor. He was in jail for around 4 hours and he was released without bail.  Miles' rep had no comment."
"Angelina Jolie abruptly split from her partner of 12 years and husband of two, Brad Pitt, in September 2016. But their divorce still isn’t final, a new report says, because they still haven’t agreed to terms about their six children.  According to E! News, Jolie is resentful of Pitt for essentially locking her down in Los Angeles, because he’s chosen a film that will be shot in LA to be near his kids. Jolie, meanwhile, had planned on taking them to Europe. “Brad is opposed to that and is blocking it from happening. Brad will be filming in LA for the summer and wants to see the kids on his regular custody schedule,” a source told E.  He currently sees his children - Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne - a few times a week. Jolie, according to the report, is ‘furious’ at the situation.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie split in September 2016. (Shutterstock)  Jolie recently took Shiloh and Zahara to Jordan to visit a refugee camp in January, and later travelled to Paris with all of her children. “Angelina has been in London and is free to travel for shorter periods of time,” the source says. “Brad isn’t opposed to that. But she can’t leave with the kids for several months.”  Jolie had initially filed for sole physical custody of the kids, but in November 2016, Pitt filed for joint custody. By December, they’d reached a temporary agreement, after the FBI concluded their investigation of Pitt regarding an alleged incident of child abuse on a private plane. No charges were filed and Pitt was cleared.  Pitt opened up about the custody battle in his 2017 interview to GQ Style, his first since the split. “I was really on my back and chained to a system when Child Services was called,” he said. “And you know, after that, we’ve been able to work together to sort this out. We’re both doing our best. I heard one lawyer say, ‘No one wins in court—it’s just a matter of who gets hurt worse.’ And it seems to be true, you spend a year just focused on building a case to prove your point and why you’re right and why they’re wrong, and it’s just an investment in vitriolic hatred. I just refuse. And fortunately my partner in this agrees. It’s just very, very jarring for the kids, to suddenly have their family ripped apart.”  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie take their children Pax, Zahara and Shiloh to a park in Budapest, Hungary in 2010. (Shutterstock)  An US Weekly report goes on to say that Pitt is committed to staying in LA, even if that means staying away from his rumoured new girlfriend, the MIT professor, Neri Oxman. “Brad and Neri are still very much in each other’s lives, although not as much as he would like,” the US Weekly source said.  But without even a draft of the settlement being written by either side, it just goes to show ‘how at odds they continue to be,’ the report continued.

Celebrity marriages have not had the best of times: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale. Middle-aged, male A-list stars are taking a beating. The situation has become so dire that the celebrity news channel E! Online is predicting the “End of an era for celebrity idol worship”.  But nothing quite prepared the celebrity world for the totalling of Brangelina.  Brad Pitt: FBI evaluating whether to investigate airplane incident Read more  From alimony to palimony to the rise of the pay-as-you-go marriage (the wage-earning party to pay into a separation fund throughout the length of the marriage so there are no surprises when or if the marriage eventually ends), Hollywood couples have long been pioneers when it comes to marital innovation, but the end of Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie has left a nuclear pall over Hollywood-land.  The normally loquacious PR Howard Bragman, known for containing tabloid feeding frenzies, offered no advice. “Just sad to me,” he wrote in an email.  In some instances, say managers, both parties should be able to walk away with their careers and box-office potential enhanced. But the Brangelina marriage crack-up already looks to be heading in the opposite direction, with reports of the FBI looking into “an incident” on a flight the Pitt-Jolie family took on 14 September.  Pitt was reportedly “lawyering up” after the FBI announced the agency “is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued”.  “This one is going to end with both of them having their images bruised,” predicts Allison Hope Weiner, a lawyer and journalist who has covered Hollywood for more than 15 years.  What is clear is that in this confrontation nothing is left to chance and the leaks that appear in the media – usually via celebrity website TMZ’s host Harvey Levin, are deliberate and highly strategised.  “They know that if they can get to Harvey first, and he publishes first, they can set the tone because the rest of the media consider TMZ a first-party source,” says one talent manager familiar with the frontlines of Hollywood scandal. “Angelina needs some kind of leverage to go for full custody for the kids.  “If you’re wise enough you can see that websites like TMZ granulate – serialise – everything because it creates entertainment product for them to carry it. They’re making money off it.”  It’s no mystery, then, that barely a week into the split, the children are already the focus of the battle. On Thursday, the LA Times received a leak that Pitt was subject to the FBI investigation over the private plane trip back from France last week.

Photograph: Valery Hache/AFP/Getty Images  As TMZ reported: “Sources familiar with the situation tell us, Brad, Angelina and their kids were on a flight last Wednesday when he allegedly got wasted on the private jet. He allegedly went wild, screaming at the kids.”  The website continued: “We’re told the plane landed at an airport around 8pm, and witnesses say Pitt continued his rant on the tarmac, and even tried leaving in one of the fuel trucks.”  In her divorce filing, Jolie listed the couple’s date of separation as the following day, 15 September, and it was later suggested that the LA county department of children and family services had looked into the incident.  Queen of divorce: Angelina Jolie hires expert in separating Hollywood royalty Read more  Though LA celebrity divorce lawyers routinely deny leaking to TMZ – and blame court clerks for those leaks – both anti-Pitt items suggest that Jolie’s publicists and lawyers (she is represented by divorce specialist Laura Wasser) are setting the pace.  “How do you think the media find out that a parent is being investigated for not properly caring for a child?” says Weiner. “In many instances, the existence of an investigation is leaked to the press.”  By Friday, Pitt was fighting back, reportedly enlisting the help of attorney Lance Spiegel, who has worked with celebrities such as Charlie Sheen and Michael Jackson. One source told People magazine: “He was appealing to her to do this quietly – not to save the marriage but to consider the wellbeing of the children – and it was ignored. He is just wrecked by this.  “He was willing to do anything, change any habit, change any lifestyle, to do what had to be done to make this work,” adds the source. “And by ‘make this work’ that means doing what has to be done to make even a split one that is amicable and in the best interests of the children.”  Jolie’s demands are already clear: The actor, 41, has asked for physical custody of the children and is requesting that Pitt be granted visiting rights, while Pitt wants shared custody, sources have said.  While none of that is entirely new or surprising, the PR battle over both stars’ parenting skills is well under way, according to Weiner: “It’s managed so the client looks like a loving and caring parent. In some cases, nannies are instructed to walk in the back so parents can be photographed with their children and look as if they have no professional help with parenting.  “Moreover, paparazzi are informed when to catch parents out at the park with their children, providing an opportunity for the star to be photographed ‘spending quality time’ with his or her child.”  How Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt defined the 21st-century fame machine Read more  Could a celebrity divorce ever be harnessed to engineer a career lift? The answer, in at least one high-profile case, seems to be yes.  When Gwen Stefani divorced British rocker Gavin Rossdale for allegedly cheating with the nanny – “the two of us have come to the mutual decision that we will no longer be partners in marriage; we remain partners in parenthood” – Stefani came swinging back with a new relationship (Blake Shelton), and heartbreak-linked new material: a duet (Go Ahead and Break My Heart); a hit album (This is What Truth Feels Like) and a TV show (The Voice).  “They may say that but it’s a racket among the lawyers,” says the talent manager. “They want to inflame and create issues that extend the back-and-forth. Then it becomes a media thing – a crisis – and that becomes licence to bill.” And that’s before the whole thing gets wrapped up in a non-disclosure agreement.  When Depp and Heard’s marriage hit the rocks earlier this year amid reports of domestic violence, a settlement was quickly agreed before any further damage could be inflicted.  The couple concluded their relationship with this, somewhat enigmatic, statement: “Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm. Amber wishes the best for Johnny in the future.”  THE PRICE OF SEPARATION  Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren  The couple divorced in 2010 following reports of Woods’ serial infidelity. Details of the financial settlement have not been disclosed, but US media reports suggest the former Mrs Woods will receive more than $100m (£77m).  Steven Spielberg and Amy Irving  Reports suggest the film director paid $100m to Irving after they divorced in 1989. The couple had been married for three and a half years but cited career-related pressures as a reason for separating.  Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise  The couple, pictured, adopted a son and daughter, Connor Antony and Isabella, and were married for 11 years, separating in 2001. Cruise cited irreconcilable differences. It was not disclosed how the couple divided their £214m joint fortune.  Mel Gibson and Robyn Gibson  After their 30-year marriage ended in 2011, Robyn, the mother of Mel’s seven children, was reported to have been awarded half of her ex-husband’s estimated $850m fortune."

"I do — again! Teen Mom OG‘s Ryan Edwards and Mackenzie Standifer got married for the second time on Saturday, November 18.  E! News reports that the pair, who secretly tied the knot in May, a day before Edwards headed to rehab, wed in a church ceremony that Standifer told E! was their “original, intended” celebration.  “It’s been in the works since the day we got engaged,” she told E! “It was never just decided upon — we knew from day one this was going to be it.”  Standifer said that Edwards’ ex-fiance, Maci Bookout, had been invited to the wedding and the pair’s son, Bentley, 9, didn’t know that she and his dad were already married.  Edwards proposed to Standifer over a romantic meal in December 2016, which was shown in an episode of Teen Mom OG that aired earlier this year.  As Us Weekly previously reported, Edwards checked into rehab earlier this year to address substance abuse issues.  His decision to seek treatment came after Bookout, with whom he shares son Bentley, 8, tearfully spoke about her ex’s problems on the MTV hit and accused him of driving while under the influence of Xanax.  She told her husband, Taylor McKinney, that she planned to stage her own intervention with Edwards.  “I’m just gonna be like, ‘You have to go to rehab.’ It’s about saving his life,” she told her husband.  In June, Edwards addressed his recovery in a statement to Us, saying, “A little over 30 days ago, I made the decision to check myself into a rehabilitation facility. I am back home now doing well, and life could not be better. Without the support of my wife and parents I would not have been able to do this.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

"Splash; Cindy Ord/Getty; Robert Kamau/GC Images (2); Felipe Ramales/Splash  Selena Gomez is a master in the art of quick changing.  The songstress, 24, was spotted on Monday on her busy promo circuit in New York. As she swapped outfits from one appearance to the next, her style staples of the day were her Louis Vuitton’s crystal flower sandals that featured black suede baby goat leather and a transparent heel. You too can get the same shoe as Selena for $1,060.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  For her first look, Gomez styled her Vuitton heels with a Jacquemus mini dress in the early morning. The navy ensemble was loose at the top and fitted through the body with a large button accenting the crossover V-neckline and split skirt. With a price tag of $696, the star’s outfit cost nearly $2,000.  Next, the 13 Reasons Why executive producer stopped by the Elvis Duran and The Morning Show. Wearing the same LV sandals, Gomez changed into a bright orange dress from Christopher Kane’s pre-Fall 2017 collection. Her colorful look featured a deep V-neckline and a side slit.  After, Gomez visited the SiriusXM studios for her Morning Mash Up interview wearing a black slip dress over a white tunic. Her Victor Glemaud resort ensemble was styled with Tura Inc sunglasses and her go-to Vuitton heels.  Then, SelGo had all eyes on her when she opted for a matching neon pink-and-white printed polo shirt and pants set from Miu Miu’s Fall 2017 ready-to-wear collection. She changed up her hairstyle by gathering her beach waves into a high ponytail, and she gave her Louis Vuitton heels a fashion break by changing into silver Gianvito Rossi heels.

"Evan Bass and Carly Waddell's wedding, filmed during a halt in production, airs on Tuesday. The pair talk to THR about ""the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love.""  Paradise is back and so is one of Bachelor Nation’s favorite couples — but it didn't always look that way.  Bachelor in Paradise alums Evan Bass and Carly Waddell are set tie the knot on ABC Tuesday when the fourth season returns for the second half of its two-night premiere. The two chose to say “I do” in Mexico, returning to the beaches where they first fell in love on last year's Paradise. Chris Harrison officiated their intimate ceremony at the Vidanta Nuevo Vallarta resort near Puerto Vallarta in June.  But the state of their televised wedding hit a snag when production on the series shut down. After a June 4 sexual encounter between two castmembers who had been drinking, Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, a producer filed a misconduct allegation and studio Warner Bros. Television suspended filming on June 11 to investigate. Filming eventually resumed two weeks later, but Bass and Waddell's nuptials took place June 17, when the fate of the season was still up in the air.  Bass and Waddell now tell The Hollywood Reporter that the fate of their wedding, however, was never a question.  ""We were always going to get married,"" Bass tells THR of the ceremony happening amid the investigation. ""Obviously if production was shut down, then it wouldn’t have aired, but the most important thing for us was to get married in Paradise.”  Bass, 34, and Waddell, 31, met and got engaged during the summer of 2016 on the third season of Paradise. Bass, an erectile dysfunction specialist, was introduced to viewers on JoJo Fletcher's season of The Bachelorette. Waddell, a singer-songwriter on Chris Soules' season of The Bachelor, also appeared on the previous season of Paradise.  Now, the couple remains one of a handful of success stories to emerge from the franchise — and they now have their first child on the way.  When they returned to Mexico amid the summer saga, they both had to block out the production shutdown to keep their TV fairytale going. “We were sort of in that wedding glow,” Bass explains. “It felt like we were in a bubble. It was all about the wedding. I think everyone was super respectful of the fact that this was our big day. It was all about us.”  Waddell, who wore a dress by Israeli designer Idan Cohen, shared her favorite moment: Bass’ face when he first saw her walking down the aisle. “His jaw was on the floor.”  Bass added, “It felt so full-circle. A year earlier Carly was puking a few hundred feet away from where we were getting married on our first date.” The pair sealed the deal with a set of Neil Lane rings.  Other Bachelor franchise alums present at the ceremony helped to ensure that the behind-the-scenes drama didn't tarnish their big day. ""Nobody wanted to bother us with stuff that would take us away from our wedding,"" Bass says. Wells Adams, who is the bartender on the current season and appeared on their cycle of Paradise, was one of Bass’ groomsman and texted him during the shutdown to offer his support: “Wells was like, ‘I don’t care man. I’m there.’”  The morning of their wedding, Bass published a column on THR pleading with ABC to not cancel the show. With the investigation still ongoing, WBTV and ABC were unable to offer any details on if the show would return.  Looking back, Bass admitted that there was doubt in his mind that he pushed aside about whether filming on the show — and potentially the series — would ever resume. “I felt through sheer willpower that I could make it come back to life,"" he now says. ""I trust everyone that’s a part of the show. I felt like we knew it would come back.""  In the wake of the season four investigation, the amount of alcohol consumed on set became a hot topic. As a result of the controversy, Paradise kept tabs on the cast's drinking when they returned to set — something Harrison will discuss with the cast, also on Tuesday's episode. Though new Paradise drinking rules were later put in place, the newlyweds said alcohol wasn't an issue during their wedding. “No one drank that much. It wasn’t like a crazy affair,” Bass says, while Waddell says she didn't even have time to drink at her own wedding.  ""Paradise is a great parody of life,"" says Bass. ""I love the fact that it sort of illuminates the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love. It’s very American. We’re ridiculous, but it’s awesome.”  And he still disagrees that Paradise is ""a drunk hookup show,"" something both Harrison and ABC reality chief Robert Mills echoed to THR earlier this week. ""There’s sexuality on the show,"" Bass says. ""The parts that are shown are sort of the fun, wild parts, but there’s so much more that happens, like the hours that we spend with a potential significant other. People don’t really drink that much. The show was more about relationships and discovering yourself.”  Waddell adds, “We’re so excited to watch the season. The show has such a dear place in our hearts.”  Waddell, now 13.5 weeks pregnant, says their baby is the size of a peach. The pair, who are due around Valentine's Day, are calling it a ""love child"" and will find out the sex of the baby in a week or so.  ""We’re out of our minds with excitement,"" she says.  ""The Bachelor producers are some of our greatest friends now,"" she adds. ""We were texting them pictures of our ultrasound, that’s how close we’ve become.""  During the wedding, all three of Bass' sons from a previous relationship spoke. Waddell described 16-year-old son Nathan's speech as being incredible because he called Carly ""Mom."" ""He’s an introvert so him getting up at all and saying the things he did meant so much to us,"" she says.  As for the rest of the Paradise season — which returns to ""being Paradise"" after addressing the shutdown in the first two weeks — Bass and Waddell say they are ready to pass the torch.  ""There’s going to be another couple this season that takes our place,"" says Bass, whose advice to making it as a couple is to ignore the negativity. ""You can’t let the haters affect your relationship,"" he adds. ""There’s no way it doesn’t affect you, but you have to work through that together. It’s crazy how one person’s tweet affects you.""  Waddell adds, ""Just be real and be honest."""

"Edie Falco’s role as Leslie Abramson in Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders reunited her with Dick Wolf, and she told One Chicago Center about it.  Edie Falco is starring as hotshot defense attorney Leslie Abramson in Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders, but it’s not her first time working with Dick Wolf.  Before Falco was an award-winning actress, one of her first TV roles was recurring on the original Law & Order as another defense attorney (and Jack McCoy’s ex-girlfriend), Sally Bell.  One Chicago Center spoke to Edie Falco about Menendez Murders bringing her back into the Dick Wolf world, and if she approached playing a lawyer any differently the second time around.  “It was not intentional,” she told us of being cast in another Wolf project almost 20 years later. “I was looking for a good script, something interesting to do, and this came along. I liked the fact that I knew the people at the helm.”  Did she attack the role of Leslie Abramson with any significant differences to how she played the equally fierce Sally Bell? “I don’t know that I did,” she said. “I think so much is in the script, and all you have to do is what’s in front of you.  “A lot of the testimony was taken straight from Abramson’s words, so you approach it [the] way that you would any role.”  The series may be called Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders, but the show makes Abramson the star. It’s Falco who is front and center on the show’s poster, and the story is partly told through her eyes as she finds out about Lyle and Erik Menendez and then becomes the lead attorney in their trials.  Of course, Edie Falco has been the main draw of a program before; she was critically acclaimed for the title role in Showtime’s Nurse Jackie, too. She’s used to being the headliner, so she didn’t mind getting top billing in this particular project.  “I figure if they want me to do it and I agree to do it,” she explained, “We’re all capable, and I understand the motivation behind the person that I’m playing. It’s become less of a deal.”  With everything that she’s done over her career, from Nurse Jackie to Broadway, from Law & Order to The Sopranos, Edie Falco has been there and done that in the TV world. She’s one of the small screen’s best actresses, so we asked her to tell us what about being Leslie Abramson in Menendez Murders could possibly challenge her.  “[There was] a great deal of frustration, just over the actual story,” she reflected. “I do hope at the end, viewers will understand that there were so many things involved in this trial—and I venture to guess other trials as well—that were politically based.  “It was the climate in Los Angeles at the time, it was relationships between lawyers, and all this stuff that had nothing to do with these guys and their parents.”  Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on NBC.

"    Mariah Carey is famous for loving ""moments."" It could be a ""butterfly moment."" Or a ""hot tub moment."" But right now, it's a ""Las Vegas moment."" The sexy superstar just wrapped up Mariah: #1 to Infinity, her first-ever Vegas residency, where she performed all 18 of her #1 hits at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace. Fans who didn't catch Mimi's Vegas show will get another chance in December when she returns to the Colosseum for All I Want for Christmas Is You, a holiday concert series that, yes, will be sure to feature that iconic, titular hit. (For those unable to head out West for the holidays, you can also catch Mariah's Christmas shows at New York's Beacon Theatre.) On top of these performances, the pop star has her hands in two film projects: the first, All I Want For Christmas Is You, is an animated movie based on her holiday hit and out this November and the second, The Star, is another animated feature out the same month in which she wrote the film's titular song.  At our cover shoot, Carey's outfits channel the glittery, over-the-top extravagance of her new city. ""I think this is kind of a fairy princess moment,"" she says of one sparkly gold tulle gown. ""And I took off my shoes to be very Cinderella,"" she adds. ""Although I don't know that Cinderella went as plunging in the neckline."" So, an adult, glamorous Cinderella? ""Adult, glamorous...yeah, I guess so,"" she says. ""If I have to be an adult, sure.""  Click through for more Mariah photos from our 'Las Vegas' cover story!  What made you decide to do a show in Las Vegas?  Well, I just thought it would be something in between albums, because now I'm working on a new album and new singles, and I just thought it was a great place to be able to be. Because I have twins [Moroccan and Monroe], who just turned six...to have them be in one place for a period of time rather than, like, touring for all that time [is great]. They go with me.  And they say 'What happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas.' Do you have any of those kinds of moments that you really cut loose?  Well, it's hard because sometimes it's like two nights on back to back so I don't really [go out] -- it's not like, 'WOO HOO,' let's, like, go wild on the Las Vegas strip, but occasionally some of my friends and I will drive around, have fun, go to different places, do whatever.  If your friend was going to Las Vegas for the first time, besides seeing your wonderful show, are there other things you would suggest they do?  Well, if they have kids they should take them to the dentist that [my kids] go to, because it's a kids' dentist and they have all these games there...I'm sitting here waiting to go to the dentist, like, 'Let me get to Vegas so I can get to the dentist!'  I can't imagine many people would recommend going to Las Vegas for a dentist.  Darling, you've got to take care of your teeth.  Your fans love your many 'Mariah moments.' You know, like your 'butterfly moment' or an 'off-the-shoulder moment' is something you're always loving. Are there any moments you're particularly feeling these days?  I like good moments. There's often moments that I'm like, 'This is not a good moment.' But usually when I'm like, 'It's a moment,' I really mean it in a good way.  What about a diva moment?  I've never had a diva moment.  No?  No...Actually, I have had diva moments, and then people can't handle it. I guess it's a little intense, because I come from a true diva: My mother is an opera singer. And that's a real diva, you know -- Juilliard diva. And so other people that are like, 'I'm a diva,' it's like, 'Honey, you don't know what a diva is, you didn't grow up with my mom.' [Laughs] And I mean it as a compliment, or I wouldn't be the person I am without experiencing that. And so when people hear me say, like, 'Dahling da da da da' and talk that way, it's kinda like I'm channeling my mother. Not that she says 'dahling' all the time, but like that voice is... it's like I inadvertently do it, and I don't do it to be disrespectful, I just do it and it just happens and it's like, [in diva voice] 'I don't even know why.'  So you can't fight it; it's in your blood.  I can't fight it, no.  If you could start a rumor about yourself, what would it be?  Start a rumor about myself? Oh, do we have to do that? Can't we just leave it to all the other people who love to start rumors? I don't know. I've already said that I insist on having puppies everywhere I go, which would be great! Like, that would be great, no?  You're such a huge star, but can you remember the last time you were starstruck?  There's always people who I admire and when I see them [I get starstruck]. The last time I saw Prince, he came to my dressing room. I had said I wanted to go visit him to say hello because we've met before.When he was living we had had lots of conversations, and he helped me through certain moments that were not easy. I don't want to get too depressing, but I was having a conversation with Prince and then I looked around the room and I noticed that everyone in the room was looking up and staring like they couldn't believe he was standing there. But I would always be a little bit starstruck [when] I [saw] Michael Jackson as well.  Finally, in three words, tell me what it's like to be Mariah Carey.  Pshh, three words!?  You can do more, but that's the challenge.  [Laughs] So many things...Sooo. Many. Things. Those are my three words.

In April, Clinton held an 11-point advantage over Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent, and had led him consistently by double digits since December.In a more hypothetical matchup, Democrat Bernie Sanders leads Trump by 15 points, 54 percent to 39 percent.Looking inside the numbers of her race against Trump, Clinton holds the edge among African Americans (88 percent to 9 percent), Latinos (68 percent to 20 percent), women (51 percent to 38 percent) and those ages 18 to 34 (55 percent to 32 percent).Trump, meanwhile, is ahead among whites (52 percent to 36 percent), seniors (52 percent to 41 percent), men (49 percent to 40 percent) and independents (42 percent to 37 percent).The NBC/WSJ poll — conducted May 15-19 — comes after Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, but also as the ongoing Clinton-vs.-Sanders Democratic race has become more contentious in recent days.Play FacebookTwitterEmbed Analyst: Hillary Clinton will gain support if Sanders leaves race 4:26 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blogRepublicans are now supporting Trump over Clinton by an 86 percent-to-6 percent margin, which is up from 72 percent to 13 percent a month ago, suggesting that GOP voters are consolidating around their presumptive nominee.Complete Coverage: Decision 2016While Democrats are backing Clinton by an 83 percent-to-9 percent clip, just 66 percent of Democratic primary voters preferring Sanders support Clinton in a matchup against Trump (compared with 88 percent of Clinton primary voters who favor Sanders in a hypothetical general-election contest). Those numbers underscore Clinton’s challenge in winning over Sanders voters once the Democratic primary contest concludes.Mr. and Mrs. UnpopularTrump and Clinton are currently the two most unpopular likely presidential nominees in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll.Thirty four percent of registered voters have a positive opinion of Clinton, versus 54 percent who have a negative opinion (-20) — a slight uptick from her minus-24 score last month.Trump's rating is even worse than Clinton’s: Twenty nine percent have a positive opinion of him, while 58 percent have a negative opinion (-29) — an improvement from his minus-41 score in April.Play FacebookTwitterEmbed Poll: Voters Have Unfavorable Views Toward Presumptive Party Nominees 1:20 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog“This has never been matched, or even close to being matched,” Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff, says of these negative ratings for Trump and Clinton.By contrast, Sanders is in positive territory.

"Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  Jamie Lee Curtis says in a new interview that she'd happily reprise her iconic role as Laurie Strode in a sequel to 2018's Halloween revival, if director David Gordon Green returns. There's no question that the newest Halloween, which wipes the slate clean with all other sequels in the long-running franchise, is a rousing success. Strong critical reviews gave way to a massive debut at the box office, one of the highest ever in October.  Green's Halloween certainly benefited from a return to the same basic premise as John Carpenter's classic original, trading in decades of increasingly messy follow-ups for a direct line to the Michael Myers that terrified audiences in the first place. The director went back to basics for this one as he avoided the supernatural and went for a renewed focus on the psychological. Clearly, Curtis was happy with the job that Green did, as are theatergoers. And despite the film's commercial success, that's likely not on the legendary actress' radar as far as whether she'd do another Halloween. But the director is.  Related: Halloween's 5 Timelines Explained (And Which Movies You MUST See)  As she explained simply in a new interview with Empire Magazine Australia (via Bloody Disgusting), Curtis says she'd be in for another Halloween sequel if Green takes the helm once again. It's certainly possible, since the original plan from Blumhouse was to shoot two Halloween sequels back-to-back. Producers ultimately decided that making two films at once was too risky. But now, it sure looks like another film will follow, with or without Green behind the cameras. ""If David Gordon Green called me up and said let’s do another Halloween, I would do another Halloween,"" Curtis said.  Producer Malek Akkad expounded upon Blumhouse's decision to keep it to one sequel in a recent interview. Essentially, he found it too ambitious to shoot two Halloween films without knowing how the first one would be received. Well, the next Halloween is reportedly already in motion, but the latest report suggests that Green and co-writer Danny McBride wouldn't be on board for it. That could change, but if Jason Blum is determined to pull a Paranormal Activity and crank out the next sequel in time for Halloween 2019, he'll need a decision from the director pretty quickly.  It's also possible that money talks. Halloween is already becoming one of Blumhouse's highest-grossing films after just one weekend, and it's doing so on a typically tight Blumhouse budget. At over $90 million domestically already, the film has a good chance to ultimately blow by Paranormal Activity ($107.9 million) and Paranormal Activity 3 ($104 million) and settle in at No. 3 behind the studio's crown jewels, Get Out and Split. Green may not necessarily need the money, but it might be hard for the director to turn away from that kind of financial success, especially when he was originally planning to do at least two films anyway.  Still, based on Curtis' comment in her interview, she may not be interested in another appearance as Laurie Strode unless Green is back. It's hard to blame her; Green had established himself as a formidable cinematic storyteller with Stronger, and showed off his horror chops to thrilling effect with Halloween. He and Curtis certainly make a fine duo, but 2018's Halloween may ultimately be the only time they team up.

"There's controversy afoot in the Kardashian universe. Again.  This time, Kim is facing backlash for ""triggering"" language she used in a video posted to her Instagram stories, in which she and younger sisters Kendall Jenner and Khloé Kardashian can be heard discussing Kim's famous physique.  “I don’t think you’re eating,” Jenner told her sis. “Like you look so skinny."" Kim replied, “Oh my god the compliments!” adding that she's ""down to 119 pounds.""  ""I will say when I take out my hair extensions I am less,” she continued.  “Your hair extensions, your a–, your tits, everything, they’re heavy, cause she’s f—— voluptuous,” said Khloé. “But she’s anorexic here [gestures to waist], her arms are like pin thin, they’re like my pinky.”  The video, recorded backstage at a City Hope charity poker event over the weekend, quickly picked up steam on social media, where fans called out the sisters for praising thinness. Others, including the band Best Coast, rebuked Kim for an irresponsible use of her platform, which reaches 114 million followers on Instagram alone.  Kim Kardashian being obsessed with her sisters telling her she’s so skinny she looks anorexic on her Instagram story makes me want to throw my phone into outer space — Best Coast (@BestCoast) July 29, 2018  Someone just messaged me & said to check out Kim Kardashian’s insta stories, I did & can’t get over what I’ve seen.

Unfortunately and inexplicably, there are people who look up to and admire you. Please do better for them. — Katie Sirles (@mister_quint) July 30, 2018  According to ANRED, an organization which raises awareness about anorexia nervosa and related eating disorders, more than 8 million people in the United States suffer from an eating disorder, so fan comments are not baseless. The praise of anorexia is considered a trigger to many who are battling the disease, according to the National Eating Disorders Association.  That being said, Kardashian has, on multiple occasions, championed the body positivity movement, and said she wants to use her very public, very image-based influence for good. “I am empowered by my body,” she wrote in 2016. “I am empowered by showing the world my flaws and not being afraid of what anyone is going to say about me. And I hope that through this platform I have been given, I can encourage the same empowerment for girls and women all over the world.”  Perhaps next time she'll reconsider her choice of words."

"That’s one way to spread cheer! Harry Styles gave James Corden a kiss during a Christmas-themed “Carpool Karaoke” segment on The Late Late Show on Monday, December 11.  The late-night host, 39, enlisted several of his Carpool Karaoke guests from the past year — including Pink, Miley Cyrus, Bruno Mars, Sam Smith, Kelly Clarkson and Fifth Harmony — to sing a fun-filled rendition of the Christmas classic “Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town.”  The holiday sketch kicked off with Corden and musician Reggie Watts, who leads the Late Late Show’s house band, cruising around Los Angeles. “The great thing about this time of year is I feel like it’s the only time we’re not judged for driving to work dressed like this,” quipped the British star, who was clad in a red Santa hat and a Christmas sweater.  After singing the tune with his many guests, Corden turned to Styles, 23, and said, “Happy Christmas, Harold.” The former One Direction singer initially stayed silent but smirked slightly. He then leaned in to kiss Corden on the lips, placing one of his hands on the comedian’s cheek and wrapping the other around his head.  “Wow, I did not expect that for Christmas,” the TV personality said with a laugh.  This isn’t the first time the fellow Brits have locked lips. During a 2013 episode of the U.K. game show A League of Their Own, the “Kiwi” singer gave Corden a lengthy smooch on the lips during a scripted kiss cam segment.

"Move over Tayor Swift and Selena Gomez, because there’s a different duo in Hollywood giving us some serious #BFFGoals.  Samuel L. Jackson and Judge Judy stepped out for dinner in Los Angeles over the weekend, reminding us just how much we love this friendship. The ”Captain Marvel” star shared a candid photo with his pal — aka Judith Sheindlin — on Instagram.  Many users commented about the seemingly unlikely friendship, dying to know what the actor and daytime TV boss could be talking about. Well, these two actually go way back. “The Kong: Skull Island” star was asked about the origin of their bond last year on “Watch What Happens Live.”  Jackson, 69, and Sheindlin, 75, had mutual friends, meeting through the actor’s agent, Toni Howard. The pair also know each other through Jackson’s lawyer — “my lawyer’s husband is the guy who makes her deals,” he said.  As Jackson recalled, they met at Howard’s house, and they used to smoke cigarettes together. “So we would sit in Toni’s backyard and smoke, and when Judy stopped smoking, she made me stop smoking. She sent me to her doctor in White Plains, who actually treats you with sodium pentothal, and I quit smoking. But Judy used to get up in the middle of the night to smoke. She’s like, ‘I used to wake up to smoke.’”  “WWHL” host Andy Cohen asked Jackson if Judge Judy was intimidating, to which he replied, “No! Judy’s awesome. She’s great. … I’ve had tea with Judy at the Dorchester in London, and hang out and fly back and forth cross-country with her on planes. Judy’s awesome.”  Photo: Getty Images Judge Judy and Samuel L. Jackson sharing a laugh.  Jackson added, “She’s straight up clocking dollars.”  It’s true — last year, Forbes ranked Judge Judy No. 8 on its list of America’s Richest Female Entertainers. Her CBS show has been on the air since 1996, and she’s estimated to be worth around $300 million.  In 2017, “Judge Judy” wrapped its fourth consecutive year as the most-watched syndicated TV show, and it continues to break records left and right. She counts her pal as one of her regular viewers.  Jackson revealed on the “Today” show that he includes in his contracts that his trailer on set must have a satellite television so “I can watch judge shows all day when I’m at work … all of them.”  Yes, “Judge Judy” would be one of those “judge shows,” in case you were wondering. He also praised his BFF on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” saying he loves watching “Judge Judy” “all the time,” adding they get together “at least four or five times a year.”  Hey, by Hollywood standards, that’s a lot."

"We'd venture to say that Cindy Crawford's daughter Kaia Gerber has had it pretty good as a brunette, especially since she inherited that brown hair — and the rest of her features — from her supermodel mom.  But the 14-year-old seems to be testing the waters of being a blonde, posting a picture on Instagram yesterday of herself with piecey platinum locks.  It's not a permanent new 'do, though — she assured her followers it was 'just a lil wig', adding a smiley face emoticon.  Trying a new 'do! Kaia Gerber showed off a short blonde wig on Instagram on Thursday  Real hair: The 14-year-old has long, brown locks that tumble down to her waist — quite like her mom's  Twins! Kaia often draws comparisons to her mother, and had the same features — and same long legs — as the supermodel  With her slicked locks and bold, dark brows, the young model looks a whole lot more like singer Rita Ora than her lookalike mom in the one-off picture.  At shoulder length, the wig is much shorter than her real hair, too, which usually tumbles down to her waist.  Kaia shared the picture just hours after letting her brown locks flow for a lunch with her mom and One Direction star Harry Styles .  Stopping by Cafe Habana in Malibu for a catch-up, the 22-year-old singer could be seen enjoying a meal and with the supermodel, 50, her husband Rande Gerber, and Kaia.  Harry — who has previously visited the Crawford/Gerber clan at their home — looked pleased to be spending some of his downtime catching up with old friends in California.  Arriving at the family's table in the upmarket Cuban and Mexican eatery, the One Direction star was greeted with a warm embrace and a kiss on the cheek from world-famous beauty.

Meanwhile, Kaia — who graces the cover of April's Vogue Paris with her mother — opted for an all-black ensemble, teaming a sleeveless top with skin-tight jeans and a pair of leather Chelsea boots.  Cindy wore a cream blouse, which she kept casual with form-fitting denim jeans. With her famous chestnut locks falling down past her shoulders, the model highlighted her naturally striking and extremely youthful visage.

The Styles/Crawford friendship appeared to first blossom in summer 2014 when Harry paid a visit to Cindy's home to visit her son Presley — who had just had his tonsils out.  And following the home visit, the family and Harry were seen enjoying some downtime in Canada, with the boys enjoying some cliff diving.

She told V Magazine in 2014: 'He stopped by to say hi when my kids and I were making pizzas. My kids were doing their own little pizzas and they couldn't slide them off the pan.  'Harry goes, ''Well, did you put down enough flour so they wouldn't stick?""'  'My husband says, ''How in the world do you know that?'' and my little girl chimes in, ''Oh, he used to work for a bakery, dad. Everyone knows that.""'

Andy added: 'We realized they had to walk by our table to leave and that would be a ""moment."" We wondered if it was more fun at our table or theirs.'

Not so amicable exes: John has discussed ending his relationship with Jen 'for life reasons' in the years following their split in 2009. They are pictured in 2008  He later told Rolling Stone: 'I've never really gotten over it. It was one of the worst times of my life.'

"Just when you think literally no stone has been left unturned when it comes to Kylie Jenner 's reported pregnancy , another headline or five emerges. Today's, featuring a theory from her fans that's made some serious waves since it broke, is a big one. According to Twitter, Kylie hasn't been MIA lately because she's hiding a baby bump—instead, fans believe she's been keeping out of the spotlight because she already had the baby. (Yep, you read that right.)  Of course, let's remember that Kylie in no way is obligated to give us an explanation: It's completely up to her if and when she's comfortable sharing her own news. But Kylie is a public figure, and Twitter exists. Remember how on Monday everyone was super bummed when the Kardashian family's Christmas card did not, as many hoped, confirm Jenner's rumored pregnancy? And then some very dedicated fans unearthed a couple blurry photos that appear to show her with a baby bump—dated from all the way back to September?  Now twitterers are saying that, based on the size of her supposed bump in those photos from three months ago (which, BTW, is in no way ""proof"" of anything ), the youngest Kardashian-Jenner sister must have had her baby by now. Another, auxiliary, theory: Jenner is for sure going to announce the birth on New Year's Eve, so we won't have to wait too much longer. And there's yet another theory about the Christmas card reveal.

"Both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have moved on in their professional lives since they got separated last year but rumours about their personal lives keep swirling on the internet. A recent report claims that the A-list Hollywood actress is upset about the thought of her estranged husband dating another woman and keeps track of him through their common friends.  ""Angelina's hyper-aware of what Brad's up to, she's always trying to keep tabs on him. They still have friends in common and she quizzes them for info. She knows Brad's ready to start dating again,"" a source told Hollywood Life.  The report by the entertainment website claims that the 42-year-old Salt actress ""hates the idea"" of Pitt moving on in his life ""emotionally"". ""It's a hard pill for her to swallow and that's got her wanting to do the same. She's very competitive and hates the idea of him beating her to the punch. Plus it drives her crazy that he's emotionally moved on since she really hasn't.""  The actress is currently focussing on her family and was often spotted going out with her six children. Pitt, on the other hand, is having a busy filming schedule and is reportedly ready to date again. Recently, he has been linked with Ella Purnell, a British actress who is 32 years younger than him.  ""Right now Angelina's still not started dating but she has been getting closer to pulling the trigger. Hearing Brad is looking to date again made her feel motivated to find someone too. Even though her mind really isn't in that space she hates the idea of 'losing' to him. She's started forcing herself to open her eyes and look around and a few guys have caught her eye,"" the Hollywood Life source claimed."

"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Meredith Mandell, Adam Reiss and Daniella Silva  NORRISTOWN, Pa. — Bill Cosby, who once embodied the idealized American father on a wildly popular sitcom, was convicted of sexual assault on Thursday in a high-stakes retrial after a half-dozen women testified that the famed comedian drugged and assaulted them.  The jury found Cosby, 80, guilty on all three counts of aggravated indecent assault against one woman, Andrea Constand, 45, drawing an emotional reaction from his other accusers in the courtroom.  The verdict was one of the first major courtroom victories for the #MeToo movement, which has exposed sexual harassment and misconduct in entertainment, media, politics and beyond.  Upon the reading of the first guilty verdict, several of Cosby's accusers sobbed and shook with joy. Cosby's head was bent slightly, eyes shut.  Although Cosby has faced dozens of sexual misconduct allegations spanning decades, he has been charged criminally only in the Constand case. Constand, a former employee at Temple University in Philadelphia, testified that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his suburban Philadelphia home in January 2004.  Constand maintained her composure as the verdict was read in Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas.  Cosby lashed out at prosecutors as they asked Judge Steven O'Neill to revoke his bail, suggesting that he was a flight risk.  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele noted Cosby's wealth and said he had a plane.  ""He doesn't have a plane, you asshole! I'm sick of it, you asshole!"" Cosby exclaimed.  Cosby faces a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to $25,000 on each count. He remains free on bail until sentencing. But he is unlikely to spend much time in jail.  O'Neill said that because of Cosby's age and his medical condition — his eyesight is poor — ""I am not going to simply lock him up."" Cosby has to surrender his passport and must remain in his nearby home, the judge said.  Lili Bernard, an accuser who once appeared as a guest on ""The Cosby Show,"" the groundbreaking 1980s sitcom that introduced an upper-middle-class black family to American viewers, let out a wail as the verdict was read. She began to cry, and court personnel escorted her from the courtroom.  ""I feel like my faith in humanity is restored,"" she told reporters through tears outside the courthouse.  Cosby's attorneys said in brief remarks that they would ""very strongly"" appeal the verdict. Cosby's first trial ended in a mistrial in June.  ""We are very disappointed by the verdict,"" Tom Mesereau, Cosby's lead attorney, said outside the courthouse. ""We don't think Mr. Cosby's guilty of anything, and the fight is not over.""  Steele lauded Constand and the other accusers for their bravery in standing up to Cosby over the years.  ""The most important person in this is Andrea Constand — 14 years later, it may be easy to forget that she was the first courageous person that stood up in public,"" Steele said during a news conference. Constand stood next to the prosecutors, her hands folded in front of her, but she didn't speak.  ""Her quiet courage and her actions through this have helped victims stand up,"" Steele said. ""I hope and I pray that our actions have shown that we will stand up with those victims.""  Janice Baker-Kinney, who testified that Cosby gave her Quaaludes and sexually assaulted her, told MSNBC after the verdict that ""the relief is overwhelming.""  ""I'm shaking with relief, and I can't stop sobbing,"" she said.  Gloria Allred, a lawyer who represents several of Cosby's accusers, praised the verdict while the women stood behind her, shoulder to shoulder, their arms around one another.  ""I truly hope that his long list of victims will now be able to find some kind of peace,"" she told reporters.  The decision came Thursday afternoon on the second day of deliberations. Earlier, the judge read back part of the testimony of the defense's star witness, who said Constand once said she could frame a ""high-profile person.""  The jury was also read back Cosby's testimony in a deposition he gave in 2005 after Constand filed a civil suit against him. In it, the comedian admitted giving a woman Quaaludes to have sex with her.  Cosby, who has repeatedly denied all the allegations against him, has said the sexual encounter with Constand was consensual. Cosby paid Constand nearly $3.4 million in 2006 to settle the civil case.  The verdict was the dramatic culmination of an 18-year case that spanned two criminal trials and multiple police investigations. Afterward, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the University of Notre Dame both announced that they were rescinding honorary degrees they had bestowed on Cosby, while Temple University, where Cosby received his bachelor's degree in 1971 and where he was a trustee for more than 30 years, said the conviction ""provides additional facts for the university to consider with respect"" to an honorary doctorate it gave him in 1991.  Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden portrayed Cosby as a sexual predator who used his TV image as a man of wholesome values to target women he believed he could silence. Prosecutors called five other women who alleged that Cosby also sexually assaulted them in a manner similar to the way he assaulted Constand.  ""He preyed on Andrea Constand the same way he preyed on all those five women,"" Feden said.  Last month, O'Neill ruled that the additional accusers could testify so the prosecution could try to establish that the assault on Constand fit a pattern or that Cosby knew what would happen when he drugged Constand.  Attorneys for Cosby asked pointed questions about the accusers' histories of drug abuse, criminal backgrounds, personal relationships and sex lives.  Defense attorneys were especially hard on Janice Dickinson, a former supermodel.  Mesereau asked Dickinson whether she had spread false rumors about being pregnant with Sylvester Stallone's child. She said the remark was an honest mistake.  Bill Cosby arrives at court for deliberations on Thursday. Brendan McDermid / Reuters  ""I had sex with two men that month. He wasn't the only contender,"" she said, garnering smiles from the jury.  Defense attorney Kathleen Bliss described Dickinson in closing arguments as a ""failed starlet"" and ""an aged-out model.""  ""It sounds like she has slept with every single guy on the planet,"" Bliss said. ""Is Ms. Dickinson really the moral beacon that women's movements want?""  The defense also suggested that Constand and the other accusers were making false accusations in the hope of gaining fame or fortune.  They repeatedly pointed to the $3.4 million payout that Constand received from Cosby in 2006. And they highlighted Allred's proposal in 2014 to set aside a $100 million fund for victims of Cosby if he was unwilling to waive the statute of limitations to allow his accusers to confront him in court.  Some of the questions and arguments drew scorn from observers in the courtroom.  Bernard, who sat in the courtroom for much of the trial, called the defense's closing argument highly offensive.  ""It was based solely on rape myths, on victim blaming, on victim shaming and on a character assassination of really credible witnesses, of very righteous victims, of victims that were clearly telling the truth,"" Bernard told reporters as the jury deliberated Wednesday.  ""It was just a display of utter misogyny and buffoonery, and you know, I'm just, like, 'Wow, how low can they go?' "" she said.  The #MeToo movement was a cloud over the defense's closing arguments Tuesday, with Bliss telling jurors that they shouldn't allow it to influence their decision.  ""Don't get me wrong — bad things definitely happen. But, ladies and gentleman, not every accusation is true. Your common sense tells you that,"" Bliss said. ""We do have to deal with sexual assault. It's a worldwide problem, just like we do with sexual harassment, pay disparity, social inequality.  ""But questioning an accuser is not shaming them,"" she added.  Meredith Mandell and Adam Reiss reported from Norristown. Daniella Silva reported from New York."

"Khloé Kardashian has put Tristan Thompson‘s cheating scandal behind her — but the drama is about to unfold on this season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  Calling into On Air with Ryan Seacrest on Thursday, Kim Kardashian West revealed that some of the aftermath will be documented on season 15, which premieres Sunday. (Khloé, 33, and Thompson, 27, welcomed their first child together, daughter True, on April 12 — just two days after allegations surfaced that he cheated on her throughout her pregnancy.)  “I don’t want to give too much away, because we genuinely had those conversations and sometimes we were filming and sometimes we weren’t,” said Kim, 37. “It was more maybe when Khloé wanted her privacy and no cameras when she was in Cleveland going through that, [but] the sisters were still all filming and talking [about] how to approach it and what to do.”  Kim admitted the situation was a first for the famous family.  “It was definitely new territory for us when you have a new baby coming into the world,” she said. “I think ultimately, we always want her to be happy, but it gets all clouded when there’s a baby, you know?”  “Her motherly instincts kicked in and she has to do what makes her happy,” she added of Khloé standing by Thompson. “So we’ll support that.”  Reflecting on Khloé going into labor in Cleveland while the rest of the family was in Los Angeles, Kim said her sister wanted to keep the news under wraps.  “[Khloé] didn’t want anyone to know she was in labor so my mom just left and got on a plane,” said Kim. “Then me and my other sisters get on another plane and we were like, ‘This is so stupid, we all need to be together and go through this!’ And it was so much drama getting there. You’ll see it all — season 15. … This season, honestly, it’s one of our best. It’s so crazy. And I’ve seen crazy.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kris Jenner Struggles Not to Cry as She Talks About Khloé Giving Birth During Cheating Scandal  Kim has been most outspoken member of the family about the cheating scandal, previously calling it “so f—ed up,” which resulted in Thompson blocking her on Instagram. They’ve since smoothed things over, and Thompson officially unblocked her after she playfully teased him about it while they were celebrating Khloé’s birthday together in June.  Though Khloé’s decision to reconcile with Thompson initially didn’t go over well with her famous family, a source told PEOPLE at the time that they “respect her decision.”  “Everyone knows Khloé plans on staying with Tristan, so things have been civil so far,” said the source. “They still have opinions about Tristan’s bad behavior, of course, but no one wants to upset Khloé.”  RELATED: Tristan Thompson Says Khloé Kardashian Knows His iPhone Passcode in Wake of Cheating Scandal  Last week, another source told PEOPLE that it’s been a “tough learning lesson” for Thompson.  “The whole family had to deal with the public’s perception of him and his relationship with Khloé changing dramatically,” said the source. “He also doesn’t fully ‘get’ that she’s been through this before [with ex-husband Lamar Odom], except that this time there’s a child involved.”  “When he got with Khloé, he tried to adapt to the best of his ability but he struggled with being part of such a high-profile family and crossed lines he shouldn’t have,” added the source. “He wasn’t expecting such major backlash from the public and it’s been a lot for him to handle.”  Nevertheless, the source said everyone just wants the best for the couple and their baby girl.  “The whole family is there to support both him and Khloé through everything,” said the source. “But they also need his commitment in order for the relationship to succeed. All of them are really hoping for a positive outcome for Khloé’s sake.”  Season 15 of Keeping Up with the Kardashians premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on E!"

"(CNN) In what is perhaps the fiercest and the most exhaustive attack against Donald Trump in hip-hop, Eminem ""came to stomp"" Tuesday night, calling the President everything from ""Donald the b----"" to a ""racist grandpa"" in an explosive 4.5-minute freestyle rap.  The Detroit rapper challenged his fans at the BET Hip Hop Awards to ""decide who you like more"" -- Eminem or Trump. He has slammed the President previously in the nine-minute 2016 freestyle ""Campaign Speech"" and in Big Sean's ""No Favors.""  ""And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his, I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against, and if you can't decide who you like more and you're split on who you should stand beside, I'll do it for it for you with this. F--- you,"" he said toward the end, raising his middle finger.  A request to the White House for comment was not immediately returned.  The latest freestyle, which Eminem revealed on Twitter is called ""The Storm,"" comes as anticipation for Eminem's eighth studio release builds. The rapper decried Trump's comments following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, questioned the President's own patriotism following his attacks on athletes and Sen. John McCain, and in closing, issued a passionate tribute to Colin Kaepernick.  ""I appreciate you @Eminem,"" Kaepernick tweeted, along with a fist emoji.  The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback is now a free agent after he rose to national prominence last fall when he refused to stand for the national anthem to protest police brutality. Eminem previously expressed his support for Kaepernick in ""Campaign Speech.""  Here are the 11 most explosive lines from his newest anti-Trump freestyle in the order that they appear:  1) 'A kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust'  Here's the full verse: ""We better give Obama props 'cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust while the drama pops, and he waits for s--- to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up and fly around till the bombing stops.""  Here, Eminem is likely referencing Trump's war of words on social media with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, whom the President referred to as ""little rocket man.""  2) 'Trump, when it comes to giving a s--- you're stingy as I am'  This line comes after Eminem references rising tensions in America.  3) 'Racism's the only thing he's Fantastic 4 cause that's how he gets his rock off, he's orange'  4) 'Cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump'  Here's the full verse: ""That's why he wants us to disband cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump. Walking on egg shells, I came to stomp. That's why he keeps screaming, 'Drain the swamp,' cause he's in quicksand.""  Here, Eminem criticizes those who have been tepid when it comes to expressing their opposition to the President.  5) 'All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm'  ""But this is his form of distraction, plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL, so we focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada. All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers.""  Here, the rapper slams the President for spending days attacking NFL players who take a knee and escalating the feud as a hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico and a massacre occurred in Nevada. Trump visited both Puerto Rico and Las Vegas following each disaster.  6) 'Who's going to pay for his extravagant trips'  Full verse: ""He says he wants to lower our taxes, then who's going to play for his extravagant trips back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?""  Last month Trump unveiled a Republican framework for tax reform that calls for sweeping tax cuts and a simplification of the tax code.  7) 'Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more'  Full verse: ""Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more. From his endorsement of Bannon, support for the Klansman, tiki torches in hand for the solider that's black and comes home from Iraq and is still told to go back to Africa.""  Here, Eminem is referring to Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who is also the executive chairman of the conservative media outlet Breitbart News.  8) 'This racist 94-year old grandpa'  This line comes before the rapper says Trump is ignoring America's racist past.  9) 'To him, you're zero cause he don't like his war heroes captured'  ""He says you're spitting in the face of vets who fought for us you b-------, Unless you're a POW who's tortured ... cause to him you're zero cause he don't like his war heroes captured. That's not disrespecting the military.""  Eminem accuses the President of disrespecting the military -- a charge that Trump recently leveled against athletes who take a knee during the national anthem. In this lyric, he references Trump's previous attacks on Arizona Sen. John McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. In 2015, Trump questioned whether McCain is a war hero, saying, ""I like people that weren't captured, OK?""  10) 'F--- that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist and keep that s--- balled like Donald the b----'  You can check out hip-hop's strongest lyrics on Kaepernick HERE."
"Solange Knowles is not taking any nonsense after her sister Beyoncé lost out on the biggest Grammy of the night, Album of the Year, to Adele.  After Adele received the award, she tweeted a link to Frank Ocean's Tumblr post, in which he accused the Grammys of ""cultural bias"".  Ocean wrote his post in response to an interview with Grammy Awards producers Ken Ehrlich and writer David Wild, in which they claimed the artist's decision to abstain from the ceremony was due to a ""faulty"" performance in the 2014 Grammys.  In his lengthy note, Ocean criticised the Grammys for giving Album of the Year to Taylor Swift's 1989 over Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly during last year's ceremony.  He said he considered performing at this year's Grammy tribute to Prince, but ""then I figured my best tribute to that man's legacy would be to continue to be myself out here and to be successful.""  ""Winning a TV award doesn’t christen me successful. It took me some time to learn that,"" he wrote.  ""Believe the people. Believe the ones who’d rather watch select performances from your program on YouTube the day after because your show puts them to sleep. Use the old gramophone to actually listen bro, I’m one of the best alive.""  ""And if you’re up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then I’m all for it.""  Ocean didn't submit his two 2016 albums, Endless and Blonde, for consideration, explaining: ""That institution certainly has nostalgic importance. It just doesn't seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.""  ‘I’d rather this be my Colin Kaepernick moment for the Grammys than sit there in the audience.’"
"It's off--""canceled,"" if you will. After two seasons and 20 episodes, the E! network on Tuesday announced they will not renew The Arrangement, one of its two scripted series, for a third season.  The fictional celebrity drama, which certainly never mined the Church of Scientology and the marriage of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes for source material, aired what turned out to be its series finale on May 13. That episode, titled ""Suite Revenge,"" was--at least for a short time--regarded as the Season 2 finale. It was seen by 432,000 viewers and drew a 1.8 rating in the 18-49 demo.  ""Over two seasons, E!'s scripted series The Arrangement has taken viewers inside the world of an A-list movie star filled with secrets, scandal and romance,"" wrote an E! spokesperson in a statement to Deadline on Tuesday. ""While we have decided not to move forward with the series, we are incredibly grateful to the cast and our production partners.""  The Arrangement was produced by Universal Cable Productions and starred Josh Henderson, Christine Evangelista, Lexa Doig and Michael Vartan.  The series stylized itself as a high-stakes Hollywood love story exploring the bizarre and sinister underbelly of incredible fame. Ratings for its first season in the spring of 2017 were fruitful by cable standards, having drawn an average of 1.3 million viewers overall and 725,000 in the 18-49 demo. Most commendably, the show became the year's second-most watched new scripted cable drama with women ages 18-34.  Despite its strong start, ratings for Season 2 declined by double digits and the show reached its low point in the middle of this year's 10-episode spring run with a stretch of episodes viewed by 400,000 people or less.  ""Sad to say I got the call that #TheArrangement won't be coming back for a 3rd season,"" tweeted creator, executive producer and writer Jonathan Abrahams early Tuesday night. ""There's grieving to be sure but also gratitude for the opportunity and the experience of working with so many wonderful and talented people. Thanks for all your support, twitter peeps. Much [love].""  As of now, The Royals stands alone as E!'s only remaining scripted series; sticking out like a bearskin hat in a mob of reality programming (Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Total Bellas, Botched) and celebrity docuseries like Citizen Rose, Very Cavallari and Model Squad.  For its part, The Royals also suffered a marked downturn in ratings this year. Its fate is additionally in limbo following the December 2017 ouster of creator-showrunner Mark Schwahn over sexual harassment allegations.  While a twin-killing of scripted fare could be in the offing at the network, E! is reportedly in the early stages of developing a scripted pilot from writer Michael Patrick King called Juicy Stories.  On Tuesday night, Arrangement creator Jonathan Abrahams fielded tweets from disappointed fans of the show. In reply to a question about whether depressed ratings in Season 2 ultimately doomed the series, he wrote: ""Yes. Definitely not for the reason that other show got canceled today...""  E! is owned by NBCUniversal."

"Zendaya , queen of one-of-a-kind style and woke interviews , has the whole ""authenticity"" thing down pat. To her, the thought of not being 100 percent true to herself is cringeworthy—hence, why she was literally cringing as she revisited some of her old videos from her short stint as a vlogger.  The Spider-Man: Homecoming star posted a video in which she watched and critiqued YouTube videos created by her 14-year-old self, Elle reports . The peppy girl in the videos—whose catchphrase is ""don't forget to smile""—is admittedly quite a bit different from the Zendaya the world is used to seeing slay on red carpets and take down trolls on Twitter .  ""When I was younger, I genuinely felt that I had to make a persona that matched Rocky, which is the character that I used to play,"" she says of the old clips, referencing her character on Disney Channel's Shake It Up. ""This is back when I literally had an entire alter-ego, and this sh*t is so obnoxious — I can't even believe.""  As it turns out, 2017 Zendaya isn't really feeling 2010 Zendaya's schtick.

""I was trying to make this positive environment and trying to be this f*cking ray of sunshine. This is the most annoying sh*t I have ever seen in my entire life. And the thing is, at the time I was like, 'Oh, the kids are going to love it. It'll be cool. Whatever,'"" she said.  She goes on to mock her own, totally forced body language and word choices, and she even admits that her haters back in the day may have had a point. ""No wonder people were annoyed with me,"" she says. ""Like, 'Oh, she is annoying!' Yes, honey, I was!""  Zendaya continues to call out her 14-year-old self for 4-and-a-half straight minutes, at one point declaring: ""I need to delete these... because it's so fake."" Hey, she's nothing if not real.

"Get Stuff We Love Subscribe to our newsletter.  / Source: Today By Rheana Murray  Adriana Lima is best known for showing off her figure in lingerie and sexy outfits for Victoria's Secret — but now that might all change.  The supermodel and mom of two recently announced on Instagram that she won't take her clothes off anymore for ""an empty cause.""  Lima, 36, explained that the idea struck after talking to a friend who explained that she was ""unhappy in her body.""  ""Then it made me think ... that every day in my life, I wake up thinking, how do I look? Was I going to be accepted in my job?"" Lima, who is from Brazil, wrote. ""And in that moment I realized that (the) majority of women probably wake up every morning trying to fit in a stereotype that society/social media/fashion etc., imposed.""  She added that women can't continue ""living in a world with such superficial values.""  ""It's not fair for us,"" Lima wrote. ""Beyond fair, it's physically and mentally not healthy.""  Supermodel Adriana Lima says she won't take her clothes off anymore for 'an empty cause.' She made the announcement in an Instagram post about the stereotypes and pressure women face. Getty Images  The model also wrote about the ""pressure"" she faces as a model, adding that she has her own insecurities.  Not taking her clothes off except for worthy causes appears to be Lima's way of taking a stand against the beauty standards women face. But it will be a stark change from her history with Victoria's Secret. Just last month, the lingerie giant hosted its annual fashion show in Shanghai, featuring Lima and other high-profile models, including Alessandra Ambrosio and Candice Swanepoel, strutting the runway in bright-colored lingerie separates and outrageously festive wings.  Lima wrote that it's time for her to ""make that change.""  ""It will start with me,"" she wrote. ""I refuse to embrace that. I am next to you. And I stand by you."""

The duo are celebrating a short concert run with Friday and Saturday’s MTV Presents Summerblast Music Festival 2017 in Croatia, then at Sunday’s Livewire Festival in Blackpool, England, though they are hoping for more.  “I looked at Jeff and he was getting old, man, and I was like, ‘I can’t do this to this boy,’” Smith joked to Entertainment Tonight’s Kevin Frazier. about the decision to have a reunion. “It was time. LL hit me [up and] was like, ‘Dude, I’m telling you, it’s time.

It was the first time being on stage in a while. I blew my voice out a little — I do that all the time.

"This week, in the midst of rising panic and gathering storms, some lucky paparazzi spotted the tabloid equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster.  In an industry of repetitive stories, unsubstantiated rumors, and Bachelor covers, these fateful shots of Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes holding hands on the beach in Malibu immediately made waves. To understand the magnitude of Holmes and Foxx’s PDA, you have to venture back four years ago, to a pre-Trump era when Brangelina was still a thing and nobody knew what a Chainsmoker was. In 2013, photos surfaced of Foxx and Holmes dancing together at a Hamptons charity event. Ever since then, the rumored duo has gone to great lengths to insist that they’re just friends, with varying degrees of success. In an October 2013 interview, Foxx called the dating rumors “one hundred percent not true.” Again in 2015, Foxx strongly reacted to the relationship rumors, retorting, “What I’ve learned about society today is that they’re so thirsty. Especially in tabloid world and social media world, they’re so thirsty to find any story… Sometimes when you read the stuff you’re like, ‘Wow! That’s so not true!’” Holmes has refused to engage with the topic altogether. When pressed on her relationship status in 2016, the actress replied, “That’s not something I want to answer.”  Despite JamKat’s press defensive, there have been numerous leaks over the course of the alleged half-decade that they’ve been allegedly dating. A blurry 2015 photo of the duo holding hands in a recording studio is perhaps the most damning evidence, along with a 2016 interview with Foxx’s friend, reality TV star Claudia Jordan, who gushed that Foxx “is very happy with [Holmes].” Jordan quickly walked back her inadvertent confirmation, subsequently telling ET that, “I have no knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all,” adding, “I’ve never seen them together. He’s never told me he’s dating her.”  Still, as months and years passed, rumors of this celebrity coupling persisted. Anonymous sources insisted on Jamie and Katie’s relationship status and tabloids, sensing a story even bigger and more factually accurate than Jennifer Aniston’s phantom pregnancy, never gave up. While any secret celebrity dating scenario is fodder for a People cover or a clickbait headline, JamKat is a particularly elusive and fascinating pairing. That’s because Foxx and Holmes’ intense secrecy is rumored to be a condition of Holmes’ 2012 divorce from Tom Cruise, which was itself the ending of one of the most widely discussed and analyzed marriages in celebrity history.  Long before Holmes and Cruise started dating, the leading man had a reputation for strange behavior—the alleged result of his close relationship with the Church of Scientology.  One of the main celebrity faces of Scientology, Cruise appeared to have, at some point, handed over the reins of his personal life to the church. In Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, Alex Gibney’s 2015 documentary, Marty Rathbun, a former high-ranking Scientologist, confesses that he was assigned to sabotage Cruise’s second marriage: “I was to facilitate the breakup with Nicole Kidman.”  According to the film, Scientology head David Miscavige—a good friend of Cruise’s—became suspicious of Kidman when she began to influence Cruise away from the church. Gibney’s film claims that over the course of their marriage, Cruise even stopped returning Miscavige’s calls. At that point, the documentary alleges, Miscavige resolved to get Kidman out of the picture. Rathbun elaborates that this campaign included spying on/wiretapping Kidman, “auditing” Cruise, and “re-educating” the couple’s adopted children, Connor and Isabella. This all culminated in 2001, when Cruise divorced Kidman.  A 2012 Vanity Fair article claimed that Miscavige subsequently made it his mission in 2004 to find Cruise a new girlfriend. Maureen Orth reported that, “The organization devised an elaborate auditioning process in which actresses who were already Scientology members were called in, told they were auditioning for a new training film, and then asked a series of curious questions including: ‘What do you think of Tom Cruise?’” The search party, Orth reported, eventually landed on Homeland actress Nazanin Boniadi. Between 2004 and 2005, Boniadi reportedly dated the actor: “In a month-long preparation in October 2004, she was audited every day, a process in which she told a high-ranking Scientology official her innermost secrets and every detail of her sex life. Boniadi allegedly was told to lose her braces, her red highlights, and her boyfriend.”  When Boniadi was eventually flown to New York to meet her new boyfriend, she was given a confidentiality agreement “specifically about Cruise,” claimed Vanity Fair. And while the relationship was initially successful, the actress quickly found herself running afoul of both Cruise and Miscavige: “By the third week in January, she was asked to move into Scientology’s Celebrity Centre. Boniadi was told that Cruise ‘wants someone with her own power—like Nicole.’ When she asked why Cruise would not break up with her himself, she was told he was not to be disturbed.” (The Church of Scientology did not respond to The Daily Beast’s requests for comment prior to publication.)  By April of 2005, Cruise was dating actress Katie Holmes, and just one month later he was enthusiastically holding forth on his budding relationship while jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s couch.  According to journalist Tony Ortega, who’s covered the church since 1995, “Katie made the effort initially to become a Scientologist herself, and then escaped later.” Ortega told The Daily Beast about the actress’ Scientology handler, Jessica Rodriguez, who was reportedly assigned to accompany Holmes during the Batman Begins press tour, recalling, “Jessica was answering questions for Katie in interviews, and it was really, really weird.” Rumors of strange behavior and restrictions abounded during the couples’ six-year marriage. (Miscavige was Cruise’s best man at his and Holmes’ 2006 wedding.) According to one particularly striking claim, Cruise allegedly insisted that “his wife stay silent while she was giving birth to baby Suri,” in keeping with Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard’s belief that absolute silence ought to be maintained throughout delivery.  As The Daily Beast previously reported, the final straw allegedly came when Holmes began to suspect that she would soon be separated from her and Cruise’s young daughter, Suri: “When Cruise and Holmes split in 2012, it was amidst rumors that the star feared her husband was planning to ship their daughter Suri off to Sea Org—an elite training division of the Church that requires its members to sign a ‘billion-year contract.’” Cruise and Holmes’ hasty settlement, which was finalized just 10 days after Holmes filed for divorce, reportedly stipulated that Suri would have no relationship with the Church of Scientology. Unfortunately, this agreement appears to have wreaked havoc on Suri’s relationship with her father, as the two are rarely seen together. In late June, InTouch reported that Cruise hadn’t seen his 11-year-old daughter in person in “more than 1,381 days.” This alleged separation is less shocking in light of the church’s practice of “disconnecting” congregants from family members who disapprove of Scientology.  A RadarOnline report from last year alleged Holmes and Foxx’s secrecy may also be a result of that high-stakes divorce settlement. The gossip site published a source who claimed that, “Katie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce.  “She’s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she’s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri,” the source continued. “Katie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the terms—and got $4.8 million in child support, plus another $5 million for herself.”  And the timing works out: Holmes and Cruise finalized their divorce in June 2012, meaning that the exes have only recently passed the five-year mark. If the rumors are true, Holmes and Foxx are now free to shout their love from the couches without fear of reprisal from Holmes’ bizarre ex."
"When it comes to fashion, no one competes with Rihanna. Heading to Indio, California to take in Coachella this weekend, she left the flower crowns and body paint at home, showing up in looks direct from the catwalk. While the star has always had fun pushing the limits of festival dressing—who can forget last year’s epic Gucci bodysuit or the Matthew Adams Dolan deconstructed denim?—this go round proved her most daring. Pulling out transparent Y/Project, custom Chrome Hearts, and a face-covering balaclava that rendered her almost incognito, she took style risks few others would attempt—exactly what she and Fenty creative director Jahleel Weaver were going for. “Coachella should always be fun and disruptive,” shared Weaver via email. “We had such a moment last year with the Gucci crystal bodysuit and mask, so how do we top that?”  when u finna run outta hangers. A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) on Apr 16, 2018 at 9:06am PDT  Upping the ante meant entering the planning stage early. Though they started to officially brainstorm a month in advance, when Weaver and Rihanna saw a great piece during February’s fashion month, they made a mental note. Case in point: the moment the balaclava turned up at Alessandro Michele’s autumn/winter 2018 Gucci show, it was destined to be worn. “Ri and I both instantly loved it when it came down the runway,” says Weaver. “So we started to think of what’s the next opportunity to wear this? The Gucci team is so great to us and such a pleasure to work with and they made it happen.” The love at first sight rule also applied to the gauzy Y/Project creation, which came with extreme UGGs that made it an outside the box choice: “It was just so NOT Coachella that it made us love the idea even more.”  Advertisement  extra af. #chella18 A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) on Apr 15, 2018 at 11:38am PDT  Making these unique pieces work requires styling magic and foresight, and Weaver gives credit where it’s due. “I have an amazing assistant Amir that really helps me stay organised and calm which allows me to just focus on all these crazy ideas,” he says. Though he’s mum on when we’ll see the next jaw-dropping Rihanna outfit, their partnership ensures plenty of great fashion on the horizon. “What I love about Ri is that she’s such a non-conformist, which pushes your boundaries of creativity,” says Weaver. “Nothing is off limits.”  This article was originally published on Vogue.com."

"The shade is so, so real! Kendall Jenner isn’t here for Scott Disick’s antics. The 22-year-old supermodel left a shade-filled Instagram comment on a fan account for Scott, 34, on Saturday night.  The fan account posted several paparazzi photos of Scott out with his three kids and his 19-year-old girlfriend, Sofia Richie.  On a photo of the group all in the car together with Sofia in the front passenger seat, Kendall commented, “Awww scott and his kids,” with a laughing emoji.  The photos seem to be the first time Scott has had his kids out with his new model girlfriend. Scott’s famous ex – and Kendall’s half-sister – Kourtney Kardashian has not publicly commented on the romance between Scott and Sofia.  Instagram  The new pair has vacation together several times in the past month and hasn’t shied away from the PDA.  Sofia has not been featured on the family’s reality series Keeping Up With the Kardashians yet. In an episode last October, Kim Kardashian mocked Scott for bringing Bella Thorne with him to the Cannes Film Festival. On that same trip, Scott was seen with Sofia for the first time, though she wasn’t mentioned in the episode.  The drama between Scott and Kourtney on the show is currently surrounding her announcing that Younes Bendjima is officially her boyfriend. It is unclear whether the family will discuss Scott’s increasingly public romance with Sofia as the season continues.  For more from the Kardashians, watch the clip below!

"Do not mess with Jennifer Aniston’s man.  The scorned ex-Mrs. Theroux is calling on every single member of Team Aniston to squash Emma Stone, after flying into a furious rage over her romance with her ex-husband Justin Theroux.  As Radar previously reported, Theroux and Stone have been jetting all over the world together, a relationship that is driving his ex-wife crazy.  PHOTOS: Sorry, Jen! Justin’s New Girl ‘Nothing Like’ Actress  “It bugs the hell out of Jen that Justin got close to Emma during their marriage and she isn’t taking this lying down,” a source close to the Friends star told Radar.  “She’s dragging Emma every chance she gets and warning pals like Jason Bateman and Jimmy Kimmel to avoid her.”  As Radar previously reported, Aniston is “fuming” over their now public romance.  PHOTOS: Ultimate Betrayal! Jennifer Aniston’s BFF Is Still Hanging With Justin Theroux  Aniston took digs at Stone’s Hollywood reputation too.  “Jen and her squad take issue with the fact that Emma never met a role she couldn’t steal from another actress [most famously ‘La La Land’ from Emma Watson],” the insider snitched and said Stone was in for a rude awakening.  “I don’t think she realizes who she messed with and how far Jen’s reach is.”  But the fury at Stone is not unlike her fury at Angelina Jolie, who famously stole her husband Brad Pitt away from her.  PHOTOS: Free Man! Justin Theroux Flees Nasty Split From Jennifer Aniston With Paris Boys’ Trip  “This is a pattern for Jen, never directing the rage or gossip at the guy who left her but instead at the next woman he hooks up with.”  And Stone should be warned, the source told Radar.  “Jen is in revenge mode and Emma needs to recognize that she’s messing with somebody with a lot of loyal Hollywood friends.”  We pay for juicy info!

"Postby Guestmr » Fri Apr 06, 2018 2:44 am  The latest issue of Woman’s Day says Aniston and Jolie have spent the past decade avoiding each other, but both agreed to attended Witherspoon’s 42nd birthday party last month. According to a so-called “source,” it was Witherspoon’s idea to bury the hatchet between the two. “For years, Reese has had to delicately balance the friendships and it hasn’t been easy at times,” says the supposed insider. “But she decided enough was enough and encouraged both of them to attend.”    The outlet’s questionable tipster goes on to say that Aniston approached Jolie first, and when she did so, “everyone in the room was suddenly aware of what was going on and you could feel the tension.” As the story goes, the conversation turned out to be “extremely courteous and civil.” The “insider” says Brad Pitt’s name was never mentioned, but Jolie did tell Aniston “she was sorry to hear of her split” from Justin Theroux.    The seemingly phony tipster concludes, “Reese was so proud of them for being so mature and poised. She had been secretly worried that having them both there could ruin her evening, but it all went amazingly well.” But while the magazine hides behind an untraceable “source,” Aniston’s spokesperson tells Gossip Cop on the record that the tabloid’s story is “made-up.” In fact, there’s nothing to indicate that Witherspoon even had a birthday bash this year. It has made headlines in past years when the actress would celebrate her birthday with famous friends, but no such party was reported this year."

Although Abraham was estranged from him at the time of his death, she wrote in her book My Teenage Dream Ended that Underwood was “my first love, my only true love.”  Sitting down with Bethenny Frankel on her show Bethenny in 2013, Abraham said she would have married Underwood had he not died.  “I probably wouldn’t be where I am if I had that life,” Abraham said.  In December, the mother of one posted a video on Instagram with her daughter on the eighth anniversary of Underwood’s death.  “In loving memory of Daddy Derek 12/28/2008 we love and miss you and we wanted to share this video with others who lost a loved one around the holidays,” she wrote in the caption."
"Usher performs at the Openair Frauenfeld Music Festival in Frauenfeld, Switzerland, July 6, 2017. (Photo: Nick Soland, EPA)  Usher has responded for the first time to accusations he exposed sex partners to genital herpes, filing a legal document containing a broad denial without actually specifying whether he has or had the sexually transmitted disease.  Usher's lawyers on Tuesday filed an answer to a lawsuit brought last month in Los Angeles Superior Court by Quantasia Sharpton and an unnamed man and unnamed woman who claim to have been Usher's sexual partners.  Usher is seeking to have their lawsuit dismissed, citing a ""general denial"" of its allegations and 13 more specific reasons why he claims the suit has no merit.  His reasons include legal technicalities, such as the statute of limitations, lack of standing by plaintiffs, the improper joining of plaintiffs in one suit, insufficient facts, and failure to meet legal standards.  But the singer also argues that any of his alleged conduct was ""unintentional,"" and that the plaintiffs themselves have ""unclean hands."" That's a legal doctrine meaning a plaintiff is not entitled to a remedy because the plaintiff has acted unethically or in bad faith in some way.  ""Plaintiffs are barred from recovery for alleged willful conduct by Defendant because any alleged conduct by Defendant, which is expressly denied, was unintentional,"" the singer's response says.  Usher asserted that he ""was not the cause of any alleged harm"" suffered by the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs ""assumed the risk"" of any alleged harm.  The lawsuit should be dismissed, Usher argues, ""because any harm that any plaintiff alleges to have suffered was caused in whole or in part by that plaintiff's own negligence."" He does not specify the nature of the alleged negligence.  Usher's four-page response to the Sharpton lawsuit is his first official statement about the case since Sharpton and her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, announced their pursuit of the singer (full name Usher Raymond IV) for allegedly not disclosing an STD diagnosis prior to sexual contact.  California law says that individuals who know they have an STD are guilty of a misdemeanor if they do not disclose their status to partners before engaging in sexual acts.  At a press conference last month, Sharpton said she does not have herpes. But she claimed there are ""others"" who do but are too embarrassed to say so publicly.  ""I am doing this so that he does not do this to anyone else,"" she said, urging the singer to reveal his status. ""Usher, if you are negative, please say so. If you are positive, you need to warn your sex partners, so that they can make their own informed decisions.”  The Sharpton lawsuit, which does not specify how much the plaintifs are seeking in damages, asserts that Usher contracted herpes before his encounters with the plaintiffs. Bloom said those happened after 2012.  Bloom called Usher's response to the lawsuit ""a standard legal answer. We look forward to taking Usher's deposition soon and to proving our case in court,"" she told USA TODAY.  Usher's publicist has not yet responded to USA TODAY's request for comment.  CLOSE Attorney Lisa Bloom says 3 of her clients had sex with pop icon Usher. According to Bloom, her clients said Usher did not disclose he had genital herpes before having sex.

Saturday, Sept. 29, is National Coffee Day, and in celebration of the most important day of the year, I’ve rounded up the best caffeine-infused beauty products from Birchbox to wake you up and keep you going. Ingesting coffee does one thing for your insides, but on your skin? That’s a whole other (wonderful) story.  “Coffee is useful in skincare because it’s rich in antioxidants that protect the skin, as well as caffeine to help the body get rid of excess fluid,” Dr. Joshua Zeichner, Director of Cosmetic and Clinical Research at Mount Sinai Hospital, tells Elite Daily. “Applying caffeine topically may improve the appearance of both cellulite and undereye puffiness, and by helping constrict blood vessels, it flushes away excess fluid that accumulates which makes the fat look more prominent,” he says.  Not only is coffee an anti-inflammatory, explains Zeichner, but it can help reduce redness, while antioxidants prevent skin damage from free radicals. “Topically applied, caffeine may help protect against some skin cancers at the molecular level,” he says.  Check out these Birchbox faves for caffeine-infused picks that won’t have you yawning. I promise.  Courtesy of Birchbox  ORIGINS GinZing™ Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer ($29.50, birchbox.com)  An oil-free moisturizer infused with panax-ginseng and coffee beans, the Origins GinZing gel will boost your skin’s radiance and hydration each morning. This pick is one of Origin’s best sellers and is light, but hydrating enough, for cooler fall temperatures.  Kiehl’s Eye Fuel ($22.50, birchbox.com)  Like food for your undereyes, the Kiehl’s Eye Fuel will hide all traces of a hangover or a restless night's sleep. The cooling cream contains caffeine and Vitamin B3 to instantly reduce puffiness and dark circles.  Courtesy of Birchbox  Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Intensive Recovery Ampoules ($112, birchbox.com)  Don’t be fooled by their size—these ampoules are stronger than they appear. Each ampoule contains ChronoluxAI technology to help reduce visible irritation and soothe stressed out skin. Unlike other coffee-infused products that you slather on in the AM, Estee Lauder suggests applying this formula in the PM, after your serum and before your moisturizer.  Courtesy of Birchbox  Clarins Detox Booster ($39, birchbox.com)  This green juice for the skin helps bring your complexion back to life. Enriched with green coffee extract, a plant from tropical Africa and rich in caffeine, this booster should not be used alone—mix in 3-5 drops with your favorite moisturizer, serum or mask or foundation.  ARROW REVITALIZE Undereye Brightening Serum ($18, birchbox.com)  This undereye makeup pen not only conceals dark circles and puffiness, but the ginseng and caffeine-infused formula works to instantly soothe puffy bags. Bonus: the product comes in two shades, including light/medium and medium/deep.  Courtesy of Birchbox  JUARA Coffee & Creme Skin Smoothing Body Ritual ($58, birchbox.com)  Reinvigorate your body with this two-step skincare system, including a body scrub and body moisturizer. Infused with Indonesian coffee beans and candlenut oil, you’ll forget you’re actually in your shower and not the trendy coffee shop down the street.  Courtesy of Birchbox  100% Pure Organic Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream ($26, birchbox.com)  Not only does this pick contain caffeine from coffee beans, but it also uses green tea to de-puff undereyes while increasing circulation. It’s formulated with natural and organic ingredients, like antioixdants and rosehip oil, for a gentle yet effective treatment."
"Taylor Swift is releasing a new song.  The Reputation singer served up another three-panel Instagram post on Thursday, featuring a snippet of ""Gorgeous"" -- the third release off her upcoming album, along with an announcement that the full song will be available at midnight Eastern time.  While it's hard to really tell from the short bite where the song is going (note to pop artists: snippets are evil and we hate them), what can be heard is a baby voice saying the song's title, followed by a short arpeggiated progression that almost feels like a Bleachers/LCD Soundsystem (circa ""Dance Yrself Clean"") hybrid. Check it out below.  MORE: Taylor Swift Holds First Secret 'Reputation' Listening Party in the UK  Thematically, Swift again seems to unintentionally (or... come on, probably intentionally) bring fr enemy Kanye West into the narrative. ""Gorgeous"" is the title of the second track on West's critically acclaimed My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy album, which was widely seen as saving his career after the infamous 2009 VMA mic-grabbing moment. Additionally, the child's voice in the teaser could be heard as referential to the preaching little girl that kicks off West's Life of Pablo album.  ... Or maybe we're just too deep in the feud-shade conspiracy for our own good. Honestly, that's just as likely.  MORE: Taylor Swift vs. Kanye West and Kim Kardashian: The Complete Timeline of Their Rollercoaster Relationship  Either way, we are clearly in the thick of a long-awaited Swift season and could not be more pumped! The only person who might be more excited is Swift's London superfan, whom the singer surprised at her home.  Watch the video below!  Related Gallery"
"The backlash surrounding comedian Kathy Griffin’s reviled photo shoot depicting her holding the severed head of President Trump hasn’t let down since it first exploded earlier this week.  In just the last few days she’s been dumped by CNN, Squatty Potty and several venues across the country. Even friend and “New Year’s Eve Live” sidekick Anderson Cooper was quick to distance himself from his former co-host, calling her photo “disgusting.” Now many are asking whether the comedian can survive her self-inflicted wound — one that’s increasingly threatening to derail her career.  “Being dropped by CNN definitely hurts her visibility,” Matt Hiltzik, a New York-based communications consultant whose clients have included Harvey Weinstein, Alec Baldwin and Justin Bieber, told TheWrap. “Her business will be fine. But her opportunities to grow beyond her core base will be limited.”  Also Read: Fox News Panel Ponders If 'Wonder Woman' Is Patriotic Enough  After widespread condemnation over her graphic photo, Griffin apologized on Tuesday, begging for forgiveness and acknowledging she “went too far.” But on Friday, she held an impromptu press conference with attorney Lisa Bloom, telling reporters she’s been bullied by Trump’s family while vowing to mock the president even more in the future.  But if the intent was to quash the flurry of negative headlines that have dominated the news cycle in recent days, it may have missed the mark.  “Kathy Griffin claims ‘conspiracy’ at mad, looping press conference,” proclaimed Salon. Jezebel called it a “poorly conceived mess.”  Also Read: 10 Women Who Have Left Fox News Shows, From Megyn Kelly to Laurie Dhue (Photos)  “I understand when you’re in this situation there’s a natural urge to respond,” public relations expert Howard Bragman told TheWrap, however, “that has to be done with great caution and consideration.”  Another top Hollywood publicist, who asked not to be named, said the news conference only made things worse.  “If she were my client, I’d tell her to shut the f— up,” the P.R. guru told TheWrap. “You’re not talking to anyone and you’re certainly not talking to Lisa Bloom anymore.”  Also Read: Jim Carrey Defends Kathy Griffin Over Trump Photo: Comedians Are 'Last Line of Defense'  According to the publicist, who said he likes Griffin, her approach was ill-conceived because it lacked any perceivable strategy.  “What is she trying to accomplish?” he asked. “Is she trying to sue Trump? Good luck with that. Is she trying to say she’s the victim? I think 99 percent of the people would disagree with that. She did this to herself.”  “It certainly keeps her in the news,” he added.  Also Read: 11 Shows That Aren't About Trump -- But Totally Were (Photos)  All three publicists said Griffin will likely retain her core fans who have supported her for years and who are mostly anti-Trump liberals.  “She’ll have to lay low for a while and then come back and address the elephant in the room, maybe make fun of herself,” the P.R. expert went on to say. “The gays are not going to leave her. This will go away if she just shuts up. There is a real crisis in this country right now and anything she says is just a distraction.”  The good news for Griffin is that she can recover … but it might take a while for the whole thing to blow over.  Also Read: 34 Streaming TV Shows You Can Binge Watch in a Weekend (Photos)  “She’s going to have to recalibrate and reconsider,” Bragman said. “But in no way is this going to end her career. She’s funny, she’s immensely talented. She’s original.”"
"SONGBIRD turned fashion mogul Jessica Simpson is bursting at the seams, looking anything but pulled together lately. But it’s not her shocking 40-pound weight gain or sloppy attire that has loved ones worried. Rather, it’s her wine-swilling, bingeand-purge lifestyle that’s endangering her health and could ultimately cause her children to be taken from her.  “Poor Jess really seems to be losing it,” confides a friend. “Lately, she’s been looking trashed, slurring her words, not making sense — no wonder people think she’s drunk, on drugs or both. There’s real concern that she’s on her way to a serious health problem, possibly even an overdose, if she continues down this path.”  ABUSING HER BODY  After a boozy coast-to-coast flight on Aug. 10, Jessica, 37, was spotted spilling out of LAX airport, barely able to walk. The bloated, double-chinned mother of two was wobbly as she made her way to a waiting car and nearly passed out as soon as she got inside.  “It’s no secret that Jessica likes her wine, but the more you drink, the more you eat, which is no doubt why she’s packed on the pounds,” says the friend. “For years, she would binge and then abstain, which allowed her to keep her figure. She’s not a kid anymore, though, and those ‘tricks’ won’t work.”  Health experts concur. “It&rs"
"Simone Alexandra Johnson is a model and the eldest daughter to Dywane Johnson; father, the famous ring wrestler known as the rock, who switched into the movie industry in 1999 and Dany Garcia; mother, a film producer, talent manager, business person and philanthropist.  Simone Alexandra Johnson Wiki, Age  Simone was born on August 14, 2001, in Davie, Florida United state but it was not long before her parents Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia got a divorce in 2008 after being together for 10 years.  She has tried within her power to keep her profile low despite being the daughter of a wrestler and movie star and the only means she uses to get to the world about herself is through social media platforms especially on her Instagram page where has over 189 thousand followers. Her captions on most of her pictures tell how amazingly she has moulded herself into becoming a strong woman. More so, her dad once made a post on his Instagram page about how he believed women are as strong as hell.  Dwyane Johnson is not the only wrestler in Simone’s lineage, her grandpa and great-grandfather are wrestlers and they have all derived their stage names from adding the ‘Rock’ to it.  Simone welcomed a baby sister Jasmine Johnson with her stepmom Lauren Hashiann, Jasmine was born in the month of December 16, 2015  See Also: Dany Garcia Wiki, Bio, Relationship With Dwayne Johnson, Age, Net Worth  Simone Alexandra Johnson’s Height and Body Stats  As a typical American, Simone has golden brown eyes and dark hair; she is 5’10 ft tall and she models for IMG models. On November 15, 2017, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association named Simone Alexandra Johnson the Golden Globe Ambassador for the 75th Golden Globe Awards. The newly renamed Ambassador position was previously called the “Miss Golden Globe” where basically her function is to present awards and escort presenters on and off the stage as well as presents some awards herself.  Dwyane Johnson once publicly announced how he has not approved of Simone dating just yet, in his own words, he boldly said he would choke anyone who comes around her with that intention. However, on Simone’s part, she has put full concentration on her career and studies not having time for side attractions despite her many followers on social media platforms.  Simone noted in an interview that she intends to pursue a business degree in college and embark on a career in sports entertainment after which she would then like to transit to talent management just like her parents, obviously indicating how much she looks up to her parents as role models.  Simone Alexandra’s Relationship with Dwayne Johnson  Most people thought Dwayne Johnson’s bond with his daughter Simone would be shaky when his divorce from her mother was finalised, however, the bond only got stronger and she is often seen as her father’s alibi. It has also been said that Simone can be hilarious because she even uses father’s lines on him ‘can you smell what the rock is cooking’.  The random statement of girls being closer to their fathers rather than their mothers is expressively displayed in Simone’s life. Dwyane Johnson has severally displayed affection for his daughter Simone not only in the private aspect of her life also in public.  He has been his daughter’s inspiration and role model as she really wants to follow his footsteps when she gets older. She has also picked interest in being a WWE superstar in the nearest future. If she finally accomplishes this dream, she would be the fourth generation in her lineage that belong to the wrestling world.  See Also: Dwayne Johnson’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements  Dwayne Johnson Daddy Duties  Dwyane Johnson has proven in many ways that he is a great and super dad to his daughters and he never fails to show how proud he is of them. He let Simone follow him to all his super duper occasions and events. At the age of 15, Simone has amazingly walked down a lot of red carpet occasions while her father proudly showed her off. One of the trendy news Hollywood gave about Simone in 2017 was derived at the People’s Choice Award 2017 where Simone turned heads at the red carpet in an elegant black dress and her father Johnson gave her a gentle amazing kiss on the cheek before he accepted his award.  It is quite beautiful how Simone has not wasted the opportunities rendered by her parents into modelling her to be an amazing young woman. Considering the rumour of her Father Johnson planning to run for elections in 2020 we would expect an amazing first daughter."
"As they prepare to welcome a child together in the wake of ongoing cheating allegations, Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson‘s future together is unclear.  “This is supposed to be the most joyous time in her life and it’s been ruined and that’s probably what hurts most of all,” a family source tells PEOPLE about Kardashian, 33, who is due with her first child — a daughter — with Thompson, 27, any day now.  On Tuesday, photos and videos surfaced of the NBA player allegedly getting close to an unidentified woman at an N.Y.C. lounge over the weekend. TMZ also posted footage recorded in October 2017 allegedly depicting Thompson kissing one woman while a different woman groped him at the Darna hookah lounge outside of Washington D.C.  Despite the allegations of infidelity — a source previously told PEOPLE that Thompson is “a serial cheater” — the insider says the mother-to-be is likely to stay with Thompson.  “She’s a hopeless romantic and she’ll try to make this work. She tried forever to make it work with Lamar [Odom]. She’s having a child with Tristan, and she’s going to try to rebuild this,” the source says.  Adds the source: “Khloé could probably convince herself to get over the fact that he maybe, kind of, sort of, hooked up with some groupie while out on the road. But being so indiscreet about it and letting it get splashed all over the place and having it humiliate her? That’s actually even worse.”  Prior to meeting Thompson, Kardashian was in a nearly eight-year relationship with ex-husband Odom. They wed on Sept. 27, 2009 — one month to the day after they met (and nine days after getting engaged) — but the marriage fell apart after the former basketball player’s cheating scandal and drug relapse, which led Kardashian to file for divorce in 2013.  Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom JAKE HOLLY/startraksphoto.com  Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom  “Khloé spent so much time with Lamar just excusing away the obvious, turning a blind eye to what was so clearly happening, that it would be impossible for her not to feel like a fool if she made the same sort of mistakes again and just ignored that N.Y.C footage [of Thompson[. That’s not the way a man deeply in love with the mother of his child behaves. It’s just not. And Khloé can’t lie to herself and tell herself otherwise,” the source says.  RELATED VIDEO: Did Khloé Kardashian’s Boyfriend Get Too Close to Another Woman Right Before She Gives Birth?  “The thing about Khloé, though, is she’s a big believer in knowing someone’s back story and understanding how it motivates them. With Lamar, her heart broke for everything he’d been through in the past, losing his mom and his grandma and his baby boy, and she used that as a justification for why he struggled so much with addiction and cheating. She’s got a big heart — too big sometimes,” the source shares.  Thompson and Kardashian began dating in September 2016, when his ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig was still pregnant with Thompson’s first child, 16-month-old son Prince Oliver. Neither has addressed whether he met Kardashian while still in a relationship with Craig.

Tristan Thompson and Jordan Craig David Livingston/Getty; Jordan Craig/Instagram  Tristan Thompson and Jordan Craig  “With Tristan, she believed his back story that he was never even that committed to her or in love with Jordan, and that he’d never meant to be with Jordan long-term,” the insider explains.”Khloé let herself believe that he’s a really good guy with a good heart. She might still believe that, honestly.”  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  With the baby’s arrival imminent, Kardashian has been nesting in Cleveland with the NBA player. A source previously told PEOPLE she planned on giving birth there, and her famous family would fly in, including mother Kris Jenner, who is already in Ohio with Kardashian.  While her future with Thompson remains unknown, the Good American jeans founder is focusing her attention on her unborn daughter.  “The only thing Khloe can do now is focus on her baby,” the source says.”What’s happened over the last 24 hours changes a lot of things, but it doesn’t change everything: It doesn’t change that Khloé has dreamed of becoming a mom, already loves her baby so much, and that soon her dream is going to come true.”  “She can’t wait to meet her little girl, can’t wait to hold her,” says the insider, adding, “and so for right now, the focus is just on getting to that day as safely and healthily as possible.”"

"The feud continues between these frenemies.  Days after Kim Zolciak-Biermann was accused by fellow Real Housewives of Atlanta star NeNe Leakes of being a “racist,” the mother of six has obtained legal counsel, PEOPLE confirms. (A rep for Leakes had no comment.)  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “She put #KKK on the Instagram post. I’ve hired legal counsel at this point. It’s just that bad,” she told Larry King on Larry King Now Tuesday.  “It’s inappropriate. In this day and age, people are dying over racism,” said Zolciak-Biermann, who hasn’t seen Leakes since the feud ignited. “I’m on a show with all African-American women and I’m the only one that’s ever been on the show that’s Caucasian, so it’s the card that sometimes they play and it’s gross. And I won’t allow it.”  “I probably won’t shoot with her again,” she shared.  “I don’t take this lightly. It’s one thing like I said to kind of banter back and forth and have an opinion,” Zolciak-Biermann, 39, told E!’s Daily Pop on Tuesday. “This is far beyond just having an opinion.”  The reality star’s decision to hire legal advisors comes on the heels of a public feud that involves herself, her 20-year-old daughter Brielle Biermann and Leakes.  On Thursday, Leakes, 49, slammed Brielle over claims of “prejudice” after the mother-daughter pair visited Leakes’ home and allegedly found cockroaches. Leakes shared her response to an old video that showed Brielle in her bathroom with what appeared to be black bugs.  In addition, Leakes shared the recently resurfaced video of Brielle on her own Instagram account.  “@briellebiermann We don’t have roaches! If you found 1, u brought it with u or it fell outta yo funky p—-! Please know I will get You all the way together when you start f—ing with me and mine!” Leakes wrote in the comments section.  “Go somewhere and let the air outta those fake lips, fake titties and fake ass because you will never be @kylejenner Yo trashy mama should have taught you better! My home is Brand New but you guys were so jealous of it, you couldn’t even give a compliment. You had to stoop so low and be so disgusting #racisttrash,” she concluded.  WATCH: NeNe Leakes Slams Kim Zolciak-Bierman Over Daughter’s Snapchat Video, Calls RHOA Costar ‘Racist’  Also on Thursday, Brielle responded in the comment section of her own Instagram post after a follower accused her of calling Leakes a “black roach.”  “I’m not calling BLACK people roaches! I found a roach in NENEs home! not calling her a roach dumb f—. doesn’t matter if you’re black, white, hispanic, asian etc you can still have roaches in ur house if u don’t f—ing clean ur s—!!! #callorkinpls,” the eldest Biermann child wrote.  Then, Leakes responded in the comments of a separate Instagram account, calling the Biermann duo “racists.”  “Kim & her daughter oops whole family are racists! What her daughter did at my home, (which she nor kim were invited to so be clear abt that as well) was pure disgusting, racist, learned behavior etc,” Leakes wrote, adding, “children are NOT off limits when you allow your child to talk to adults any kind of way, post disrespectful things on social media and so on. Kim is a calculating bio polar racist with a horrible mouth, who uses black folks for her come up.”  Zolciak-Biermann told her side of the story to defend Brielle, saying RHOA fans and viewers will soon see the bug incident play out on the upcoming season.  “First off that video is a combination of 2 videos! I COMBINED THEM! Brielle posted the first video on snap unaware of the large bug in front of her when she was kneeling down .. until her DM’s blew up! She removed the video immediately!! I was filming as an INVITED guest at @neneleakes for RHOA!! Brielle was invited as well!” Zolciak-Biermann wrote on Instagram.  “Brielle went to the bathroom and saw several bugs and had sent ME the video on snap and NO ONE ELSE!!! We ARE filming a show, remember that, (RHOA) and Nene released this video herself! No one has EVER seen this video but RHOA! Nobody would have ever seen this video! Nene has said and done some things that are absolutely disgusting, however I will take the high road as you will see it on the show soon enough, but you WILL NOT make it seem as though my daughter did ANYTHING wrong! She never posted this video nor would she! As you see here I myself was not willing to send the video just for ratings for RHOA. END OF STORY,” Zolciak-Biermann concluded.  In a follow-up post, Zolciak-Biermann wrote a lengthy statement.  “It’s so sad and offensive that someone can stoop so low as to call someone a racist just because they are mad. Everyone in my life knows that I am far from racist and unfortunately NeNe Leaks has tried for the last 10 years to paint that picture because that’s her last resort. (It’s convenient that I’m not racist when we are getting along.),” she said.  “In a day and age where racism is very much alive and people are actually dying because of real racists, it’s heartbreaking that NeNe would cry wolf like this only because she’s upset. I think everyone including Nene needs to spend some time uplifting people insted of tearing them down. Nene should be embracing love instead of making up lies. There is absolutely no credibility to anything that she has said. I will NOT stand for these slanderous comments!”  WATCH: NeNe Leakes Returning to ‘Real Housewives of Atlanta’ for Season 10!  Later, Leakes responded to Zolciak-Biermann’s post with another statement of her own.  “Kim Zolciak is the one that sent the video to Cynthia, Sheree, Marlo, Porsha and Kandi while we were filming in Spain. Now she has the nerve to make a pitty post! No one from Kim’s household was invited to my white party. Kim came as Sheree’s plus 1. She is a huge lier,” Leakes wrote.  “All this season I have done nothing but try an be kind to her even when she said disrespectful things to me and broke glasses in my home. I STILL continue to be kind to her but this calculated video that was shot in my home during a time when we had no problems shows how low she will really go! Then she turns around an try to get the fans on her side of this s— #trash.”  The Real Housewives of Atlanta premieres Nov. 5 (8 p.m. ET) on Bravo."
"Earlier this week, Dolce & Gabbana designer Stefano Gabbana commented on a picture of Selena Gomez to call her ugly. Miley Cyrus isn't about to stand for that, and she voiced her opinion on the matter via Instagram comments.  One of Miley's fan accounts posted this picture a day ago, of Selena and Miley at an event together.  And Miley commented on the picture more than once, writing ""Well what that d*ck head said (if it’s true) is f*king false and total bull sh*t."" In another comment, she wrote, “She fine as f*ck.”  Here's a screenshot of the comments, because obviously receipts are important:  Instagram @MileyOfficially  Stefano has a long history of feuding with celebrities, including Miley. Last summer, Miley's brother Braison modeled in a Dolce & Gabbana show. After the fact, Miley posted a picture of him on the runway saying how proud she was, but also criticizing the company's politics. Stefano commented on her Instagram saying they'd never work with Braison again because of her critique. PopCrazy made the correlation earlier this week.  This isn’t Gabbana’s first time lashing out at a former Disney star. Last year, he ignited a feud with Miley Cyrus that led to him banning her and her brother, Braison Cyrus from working with D&G again. pic.twitter.com/6NTowPwiEp — Pop Crave (@PopCrave) June 13, 2018  FYI, Stefano hasn't apologized for his comments about Selena, but has gone on Instagram to further reinforce and bully Selena by posting stories making fun of fans asking him to apologize.    Miley and Selena grew up together on the Disney Channel, so to speak, while Miley starred in Hannah Montana and Selena was on Wizards of Waverly Place. There were rumors that the two actresses didn't like each other, but Selena cleared the air in an interview with W Magazine in 2016.  “We never feuded. We both liked the same guy when we were 16,” Gomez told W, speaking about their mutual ex Nick Jonas. “It was just a Hilary Duff–Lindsay Lohan thing: ‘Oh, my God, we like the same boy!’ We are now completely settled in our own lives.”  Follow Emma on Instagram."
"In anticipation of her next big moment, Cruz had an intimate phone conversation with a friend who has been there since the early days, before she made history: Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow.  GWYNETH PALTROW: I was trying to remember when we first met, but I’m afraid I can’t.  PENÉLOPE CRUZ: We had lunch at Madeo in Los Angeles. We were alone and talking about our deepest secrets, as if we had known each other for 20 years. It was around the time I was doing All the Pretty Horses [2000].  PALTROW: Wow. We’ve been friends for a long time. We’ve been through so much together.  CRUZ: And even though we live so far away and don’t spend nearly enough time together, when I see you, it’s like it was only yesterday.  PALTROW: I was thinking the other day about how you used to study dance. Was your goal to become â¨a ballerina?  CRUZ: That’s what I wanted as a little girl. By the time I went to ballet school at age 4, I was already asking to play the role of Carmen. I didn’t realize then that the reason I liked dancing was because it was just another form of acting. I was hard-core, training something like five hours a day, six days a week. But when I did my first movie, when I was around 17, I just fell in love with acting. That’s when I stopped dancing.  PALTROW: Do you miss it?  CRUZ: I miss the freedom I felt when I was dancing. I remember it as some kind of trance. I imagine singing is like that for you. You have such an amazing voice.  PALTROW: It’s totally like that. How did you get your first job?  CRUZ: I got an agent when I was 15, and she sent me to a casting for Jamón Jamón [1992]. And I got the job. For both Javier and I, that was the movie that actually started both our careers.  PALTROW: You were 17 when you did that?  CRUZ: I think I was, but I was lying so much about my age that I can’t be sure.  PALTROW: Most actresses try to make themselves younger, but you were making yourself older.  CRUZ: I’ve spent most of my career trying to make myself older, for different reasons. Journalists have been asking me, since I was, like, 22, “Are you afraid of aging?” That is such a crazy question for a 22-year-old girl or, for that matter, for a 42-year-old. I combat that craziness by refusing to answer the question.  PALTROW: It’s amazing, Hollywood’s obsession with the aging of women. And how much scrutiny we get for being whatever age we are.  CRUZ: My mom worked very hard to raise us, as did my dad, without bullshit. I’ve always had a real sense of rootedness in family and reality. It’s not like I’m proud of the values I have, because I don’t feel like they’re up to me—they just come from the way I was raised. I’m rooted by the things I’ve seen in my mom, the things I admire in her. And in my father. When it comes to talking about aging as an actress, I feel like, “What the fuck? I’m not going to give you even two minutes to honor your question. It doesn’t deserve that.” Something changed when I gave birth to my daughter. I started thinking, “Come on, it’s 2017. Why do women still have to be talking about this? It’s crazy.” That sense only got bigger when I had children."
"There's been a surprising lack of footage from the upcoming adaptation of Stephen King's The Dark Tower.  Outside of an early leak of the trailer back in October, alongside footage shown to attendees at CinemaCon, we've only now gotten its first trailer ahead of its August release.  However, with such a Disney-dominated start to the year - between trailers for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, The Last Jedi, Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Thor: Ragnarok - perhaps Sony has bided its time so the relatively risky film doesn't get drowned out by the competition.

"Rosanna Arquette is spilling the beans on the one who got away.  The actress, 58, was on Thursday’s Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen where she was asked by a fan if she’d ever turned down a Hollywood star when her own was rising in the ’80s thanks to films like Desperately Seeking Susan and The Big Blue.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Warren Beatty,” she answered, to a surprised-looking Cohen. The night’s other guest, Laverne Cox, asked Arquette the question on everyone’s mind: “Why did you say no to Warren Beatty, girl?”  “He’s very handsome, beautiful, but it just didn’t feel like it was for me,” she explained. “But that was in the old, old days.”  Beatty is of course now married to Annette Bening, who Arquette described as “the greatest.” The two wed in 1992 and share four children — Stephen Ira, 25, Benjamin, 23, Isabel, 20, and Ella, 17.  RELATED: How Annette Bening Tamed Hollywood Bachelor Warren Beatty: ‘Every Day She Surprises Me’  During her visit, Arquette also revealed her family is suffering “PTSD” over her sister Alexis’ death almost two years ago. “It’s been fractured and hard since Alexis passed. It’s been really painful for all of us. We’re in PTSD,” the actress said.

"Michelle Obama has some summer workout motivation for you The former First Lady is keeping up her White House traditions  Michelle Obama may not be in the White House anymore, but she is determined to continue with some of the traditions she established while she was there. The former First Lady has revealed that she still hosts regular ""boot camp weekends"" with her friends like she used to, and took to Instagram to share some photos from their most recent meetup.  GALLERY: See inside Michelle and Barack Obama's new home  Posting a series of snaps of herself and a group of women exercising in the park, Michelle wrote: ""When I was at the White House, I often hosted boot camp weekends for my close girlfriends. It didn't matter that we were all at varying fitness levels. Our boot camp weekends were a reminder that if we want to keep taking care of others, we need to take care of ourselves first. And even though I'm no longer at the White House, I've continued this tradition and wanted to share some photos.""  VIEW GALLERY  Michelle Obama hosted a boot camp weekend for her friends  The mother-of-two continued: ""My girlfriends have been there for me through all kinds of life transitions over the years – including a pretty big one recently! – and we've done our best to stay healthy together. Whether it's a boot camp or a walk around the neighbourhood, I hope you and your crew can find some time this summer to be healthy together.""  Keeping fit and healthy is incredibly important to Michelle, and she previously pioneered the Let's Move! Public health campaign to aim to reduce childhood obesity and encourage a healthy lifestyle in children. The 53-year-old said she always wants to be in the best health she can possibly be, telling Prevention: ""I always want to be on the cusp of being in the best shape that I can be. What I'm discovering is that the older you get, the more work you have to do to stay there. When I was younger, I could eat whatever I wanted, as long as I exercised; or if I didn't exercise and just watched what I ate, I'd maintain. Well, now I have to do both.""  VIEW GALLERY  The former First Lady wants to maintain her White House traditions  Michelle also revealed how she had changed her workouts over time. ""I'm varying my workouts so it's not just cardio but also includes moves to maintain my flexibility,"" she explained. ""I incorporated Pilates and do much more stretching.""

"Barton: Medicare Drug Program Drawing Participants by the Thousands WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, made the following statement today during the full committee hearing on the Administration's FY '07 Health Care Priorities: ""Good afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Secretary Michael Leavitt today to the Energy and Commerce Committee. We look forward to hearing him testify about the Administration's Fiscal Year 2007 Health Care Priorities. ""First, Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for your assistance in developing the important reforms we put into place for the Medicaid program starting this year. As a former governor yourself, you understood and appreciated the need to improve this program. Through passage of the Deficit Reduction Act, we will sustain Medicaid for those people who most often need health care and to get good get their health care through good jobs in a thriving economy instead of from a government welfare program. The reforms we adopted recently are beginning to rescue the program from the threat of financial collapse. I look forward to working with you to see that the governors get the tools they need to better manage the program and deliver its benefits to the poor of their states. ""I want to briefly highlight at least some of the changes in the law that have not recently received the public attention that they deserve. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 115,000 disabled children covered by the Family Opportunity Act will receive improved health care services as a result of the recently passed Deficit Reduction Act. The new law will provide access to new home and community based care to 120,000 individuals; and it will facilitate 100,000 nursing home residents to return to their communities through the Administration's Money Follows the Person Demonstration. These are the true results of Medicaid reform - better access to better care for those who most need our assistance. ""There is still much to be done to improve long-term care service delivery and financing as well as to promote Medicaid managed care. I have received the administration's proposals regarding additional improvement to the Medicaid program and I look forward to working with you this year on them. ""This year the secretary and the administration also are required to administer the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Making this program succeed is a high priority of yours, and it is a high priority of this committee that I chair. ""Since it began, critics have tried to make patients believe that they are not smart enough to understand the new Medicare drug benefit, that it provides inadequate coverage, and that signing up isn't worth their time because it cannot save them any money. The critics are simply wrong. They were wrong when they complained about the Medicare prescription drug card. They were wrong when they said nobody would offer any insurance plans. And they are wrong now. ""Some sense political advantage in condemning the program and others can't bring themselves to admit that free markets actually work. Transparency and competition will drive down prices and provide lower costs to consumers. Even if the critics don't get it, Medicare beneficiaries certainly do. That is why over 3.6 million Medicare beneficiaries have already signed up for the new benefit. You told me earlier today that there are close to 24 million Americans that have been enrolled in the program, through one means or another, and enrollment is increasing at approximately 250,000 people per week. That sounds like a success story to me. If you add that to the fact that the premiums which we estimated at $37 a month is now down to an average $27 per month, that appears to me to be a successful program. ""This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches. The committee will work closely with yourself and Dr. Mark McClellan at CMS to get problems noticed and solved. We will have the first of what will likely be several hearings on this topic on March 1, when Dr. McClellan will testify before the Health subcommittee. I expect that we ask him very direct questions about where the problems are and what CMS is doing to fix them. ""Another high priority for the committee will be the reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and related programs. I want to restate my deep commitment to reauthorizing the NIH and would ask for the secretary's assistance in working out the technical details so that we can enact this long overdue legislation. In addition, the authorization for the Ryan White CARE Act has now lapsed. I believe that funding unauthorized programs is not a responsible practice, and I anticipate that the committee will work to reauthorize these programs this year. ""I also intend to work with you this year on ways to reform Medicare reimbursement, and particularly focus on physician payment reform. In order to preserve access to Medicare services for future generations, we must look at how we are spending our Medicare dollars today and what are the incentives are for our physician community to continue providing quality health care. ""Another top priority of the committee will be to work with you on the proposals outlined in the Administration's budget to provide consumers with greater access to comparative price and quality data about their health care providers. I could go on, but my time has expired."" ####"
"President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it’s hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.The resolution wasn’t sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a ‘discriminatory manner,’ particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia.While some are saying that a ‘no’ vote might imply a rejection of the death penalty in general, The Human Rights Council resolution specifically stated that it condemned the “imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.”To have a ‘no’ vote puts the United States in a very select group of countries. Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this.Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said:“It is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love.” “This is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end.”Since taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including:Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity.Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order.Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly.Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights."
"P!nk Hands 12 -Year-Old Superfan the Mic at Her Concert & Is Blown Away: Watch  Many people can only dream of the chance to sing their favorite artist's song right in their presence. For 12-year-old Victoria Anthony, that dream came true at Pink's concert in Vancouver on Saturday (May 12).  Back on May 1, Anthony shared a video of herself on Twitter directed to the ""Beautiful Trauma"" singer: ""when you come here, I really want to sing at your concert,"" she wrote. Anthony then gave a few examples of her incredible singing voice, including the hashtag #vicandpink in the caption to help gain traction and -- hopefully -- the attention of her idol.  After being picked up by Canadian news outlets, Pink recognized the young pop star in the making in the crowd at the show. While Anthony didn't get to go on stage, Pink did hand her the mic -- and was instantly floored.  Anthony belted out a flawless solo version of Pink's hit ""Perfect,"" drawing a roaring applause from the crowd and a stunned response from the singer. Judging by her reaction, it's safe to assume Pink thought Anthony was pretty ""perfect"" herself.  ""Thank you for that,"" the still-amazed Pink said after returning onstage. ""How do you follow that?""  Watch Anthony give Pink a run for her money below, and see the video she tweeted that made it all happen."
"Amanda Knox has revealed she is still haunted by her Foxy Knoxy nickname years after her infamous murder trial as she launches a new show in which she interviews other 'vilified' women like Mischa Barton and Amber Rose.  Knox, the American exchange student convicted and later cleared of a murder in Italy, was dubbed 'Foxy Knoxy' when she became a global tabloid sensation during her 2009 trial.  Her sexuality came under heavy scrutiny during the trial with prosecutors alleging that Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, killed her roommate Meredith Kercher in a drug-fueled sex game gone wrong.  Knox, now 30, was referred to at the time as a 'sex-mad American party girl' and an 'evil temptress'.  Amanda Knox is launching a new show for Vice in which she interviews women, including Mischa Barton, (pictured above) who have been vilified or shamed because of their sexuality  Knox has revealed she is still haunted by the Foxy Knoxy nickname and told GMA on Wednesday that it often makes her feel like she is living a double life  'I could have been the kinkiest person in the world it and it shouldn't have mattered because it has nothing to do with the evidence of the case,' Knox told Newsweek.  'The fact that I was accused of orchestrating a rape game - it was so absurd.  'The prosecutors and police looked at me and talked about me like I reeked of sex, that I was the weird, odd one out.  'They took that to mean I was somehow guilty of something, instead of checking their judgment and letting the evidence speak.'  In an interview with Good Morning America on Wednesday, Knox said her Foxy Knoxy nickname often made it feel like she was living a double life.  'I'm in a limbo space where Amanda Knox a real person exists and Foxy Knoxy an idea of a person exists,' she said.  'I'm constantly having to juggle how someone is interacting with me based on that two-dimensional version of me that has been in the public's imagination for so long.  Knox wants to draw attention to other women who have been shamed because of their sexuality with her new show The Scarlet Letter Reports. One of the women she interviews is model Amber Rose (above) who has publicly shared her own experiences with 's**t-shaming'  Knox's show The Scarlet Letter Reports premiere's on Facebook Watch on Wednesday. Pictured above is a behind the scenes look at her interview with Mischa Barton  Knox (right on right) and Barton (left) filmed a segment of the show speaking about how the OC actress filed a lawsuit against an ex-boyfriend who allegedly tried to leak a sex tape of her  'I'm not alone in that. As soon as you've been labelled something, as soon as you've been given that catchy salacious nickname, the real you is gone and you are absorbed into this template character.'  Knox now wants to draw attention to other women who have been shamed or vilified because of their sexuality with her new show The Scarlet Letter Reports.  The show, which is for Vice's Broadly and will be broadcast on Facebook Watch, includes Knox's interviews with women including Mischa Barton, Amber Rose and Brett Rossi.  Barton filed a lawsuit against an ex-boyfriend who allegedly tried to leak a sex tape of her, while Rose has previously publicly shared her own experiences with 's**t-shaming'.  'In all cases of wrongful conviction, you see people who fall victim to our impulse to vilify, scapegoat and punish,' Knox said on GMA.  'In my case, my vilification came through the lens of our society's impulse to vilify women and female sexuality.  'Coming home from that, I've seen how that same vilification process happens towards other women and that's what this show is all about - bringing back compassion and context to journalism without somehow losing the objectivity or integrity of journalism.'  Knox, above in 2007, spent four years in an Italian prison after being convicted alongside her then-boyfriend in the 2007 stabbing death of her British roommate  Knox was exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015 and then returned to Seattle to rebuild her life. She has been dating her author boyfriend Christopher Robinson since 2015  Knox said she came up for the idea for her new show before the #MeToo movement started in October 2017 when scores of women came forward with accusations of sexual harassment and rape.  'It's an incredible time to be a woman. We're redefining what it means. I'm amazed and so grateful to be a part of it. I never thought I would be here,' Knox told Newsweek.  'Not too long ago, I thought I would be spending the best decades behind bars for something I didn't do.'  Knox, a student from Seattle, spent four years in an Italian prison after being convicted alongside her then-boyfriend in the 2007 stabbing death of her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher.  She was exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015 and then returned to Seattle to rebuild her life.  Knox started dating and then got engaged to musician Colin Sutherland in 2015.  The couple split sometime that year and Knox started dating Seattle poet and author Christopher Robinson in late 2015."

"After more than a decade, actor Billy Bob Thornton shared what led to his divorce from actress Angelina Jolie in 2003.  Thornton has married six times, but his relationship with Jolie—who is 20 years younger than the Goliath actor—was among his most notable. Jolie was Thornton's fifth wife. The former spouses met on the set of Pushing Tin in 1999. At the time, he was engaged to Big Little Lies star Laura Dern. Thornton and Jolie tied the knot in 2000, but they separated three years later.  ""I remember our time together as really being great,"" Thornton, 62, said on The HFPA in Conversation podcast Wednesday. ""We just had different lifestyles. Hers is a global lifestyle, and mine is an agoraphobic lifestyle, so that's really—that's the only reason we're probably not still together maybe, because of a different path in life we wanted to take.""  Thornton said he's maintained a friendship with Jolie since their divorce. ""Angie is still a friend of mine, and she's a great person, and she's done so much,"" he told The HFPA. ""She makes movies that are important to her whether they succeed or fail, she still does what she believes in, and I'll always respect her for that.""  When Thornton and Jolie were together, they were known for their seemingly eccentric ways. They had an immediate attraction, which ultimately led Thornton to allegedly part ways with live-in fiancée Dern without warning.  Dern learned of Jolie and Thornton's relationship after receiving calls from tabloids.  ""I left our home to work on a movie, and while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I've never heard from him again,"" Dern said in Talk magazine 2000. ""It's like a sudden death. For no one has there been any closure or clarity.""  Jolie notably had Thornton's name tattooed along her arm, and they both wore a vial of each other's blood around their necks. The former pair announced their plans to adopt a child—Maddox Jolie-Pitt—from Cambodia together in March 2002, but it was later disclosed that Jolie adopted her eldest kid as a single parent.  Since parting ways, the Bad Santa actor married puppeteer Connie Angland in 2014. Jolie is in the midst of a custody battle with former spouse Brad Pitt.  Representatives for Jolie did not immediately return Newsweek's request for comment regarding Thornton's remarks.  Kevin Winter/Getty Images"
"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:"

"Are wedding bells in the future for Mariah Carey? The iconic singer reportedly popped the question to her bae, Bryan Tanaka, and the two are busy planning their big day!  Did Mariah Carey, 47, have a vision of love when looking at boyfriend Bryan Tanaka, 34, one that left her feeling all sorts of emotions? After deciding that she just can’t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen – an engagement, that is! “Word is Mariah took matters into her own hands,” a source tells OK! magazine, “It was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she’s ready for them to make their relationship official.”  Bryan gave a “hearty yes,” as the insider says, “He couldn’t believe his luck!” It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren’t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. “Mariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,” the insider told OK!, “where she and Bryan first went public with their romance.” Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her “boyfriend.”  Mariah’s “also toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,” the source says. “After all, she is the queen of Christmas!” Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she’s always wanted, saying “Thank God I found you” to her honey, her all? Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don’t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!  This alleged engagement would be the third time Mariah walked down the aisle, as she was previously married to Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37. After dealing with a pair of heartbreakers, MiMi isn’t fooling around, especially when it comes to her $520 million fortune. She’s working on an ironclad prenup, according to OK! magazine. “She’s had tow failed marriages already,” the source says. “She’s not going to take any risks here.” Speaking of Nick, expect to see him during Mariah’s big day.  Nick and Mariah’s twins – son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 – will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah’s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. “[He] will always be a big part of her life,” the source added. Considering Mariah, Nick and the twins recently made an adorable appearance at the 2018 Kids’ Choice Awards, it makes total sense that Mariah’s ex would be on hand to see her say “I Do” again."

"This story contains spoilers for the “Outlander” season 2 finale and vague plot details from the third book in Diana Gabaldon’s series of novels, “Voyager,” on which season 3 will be based. If you want to go into season 3 with no knowledge of what might come, turn back now.  Season 2 of “Outlander” began with a disoriented Claire Fraser (Caitriona Balfe) returning through the standing stones at Craigh na Dun, alone and pregnant, to reluctantly reunite with her first husband, Frank (Tobias Menzies) in 1948. In the premiere, we saw Claire and Frank negotiating how they might raise a child together, with their relationship irrevocably strained by the events of Claire’s absence and the man she fell in love with during that time away.  Sunday’s finale, titled “Dragonfly in Amber,” showed us the harrowing moments leading up to that reunion, as Claire’s second husband, Jamie (Sam Heughan) convinced her to return to her own time in order to protect her and their unborn child, since he believed that he was destined to die with his men at the Battle of Culloden.  That seemed like the end of Claire and Jamie’s story (although fans of Diana Gabaldon’s novels already knew that there’s plenty more of this tale to be told, with eight books currently published and more to come — not to mention the fact that the show was already renewed for season 3 and season 4), until Claire discovered that Jamie survived both Culloden and the execution of Jacobite soldiers that followed the battle, meaning that there was a chance they could still reunite if she went back through the stones — albeit after 20 years apart.  Related 'Outlander' Producer on Dealing With 'Different Sensitivities' in Depicting Sexual Assault 'Outlander' Recap: Brianna Is Brutally Attacked in 'Wilmington'  Given the number of books in Gabaldon’s series (and the fact that viewers would probably riot if Sam Heughan suddenly disappeared from the show), it’s not much of a spoiler to say that Claire and Jamie will someday find each other again. “There’s a lot of challenges to season 3 — there’s a period of time where Jamie and Claire are apart; he thinks that he’s lost her, or at least that she’s alive and well but in the future, so what is he living for? What sort of man is he now?” Heughan observes. “She will eventually return, but they’re both older, so what is Jamie, who is the man he’s become” in the time since they last saw each other?  Those questions — “who is Jamie without Claire, why is he still surviving, what has he got to live for when he’s lost the woman that he loves” — will be central to the character in season 3, according to Heughan.  And therein lies both the tragedy and romance at the heart of the “Outlander” series, which, despite its genre-bending sensibilities, incisively explores the sometimes harsh realities of a lasting relationship, with all the triumphs, complications, joys and heartbreaks that go along with it. When they find their way back together after decades spent separated, Claire and Jamie will have to relearn what it means to be a couple, something that Balfe admits she’s eagerly anticipating in season 3.  “I think what’s going to be most exciting is the reunion between Claire and Jamie and them discovering each other again and falling in love all over again,” she tells Variety. “I think both of them have probably held each other up on a pedestal for 20 years, so in many ways, they’re going to have to destroy that image first before they can fall in love with the person right in front of them, and that’s going to be really interesting. I love the complexity of that, because you can’t be in love with a ghost, and Claire is in many ways in love with Jamie’s ghost, as Jamie is in love with her ghost, and that’s not the people they are when they see each other again.”  The season 2 finale may have jumped ahead in time to introduce us to Claire and Jamie’s daughter, Brianna, on the cusp of adulthood, but we still have 20 years of lost time to revisit, and the show isn’t likely to skip over all of it, especially since those life experiences will inevitably have shaped who Claire and Jamie are now that they’re middle-aged.  “What I’m so excited about as well next season is we’ll see, hopefully, some of her progression as a mother,” Balfe says. “So even though we’ve jumped forward in episode 13 [to see Claire] at 50, hopefully we’ll see some of that journey between late 20s and 50.”  While the actors had yet to read scripts for season 3 when they spoke to Variety before the finale aired, Gabaldon’s “Voyager” gives us some hints as to what we might see in the new season, including a final showdown between Jamie and Menzies’ Black Jack Randall, who was destined to die on Culloden Moor.  “If you’ve read the books you will know that Randall will appear again,” Heughan teases. “I know that Diana has written the scene of how they ended up [back together], so hopefully – and who knows, I haven’t read the script yet, but hopefully, we’ll get to see Jamie and Randall in the Battle of Culloden.”  We’re also likely to see Frank again, to give viewers a sense of the realities of his relationship with Claire. We know from some of Brianna’s comments in the finale that her parents’ marriage wasn’t particularly idyllic in its later years, and Menzies confirms that the tentative plan is for season 3 to explore the couple’s dynamic following the move to Boston, including “the disintegration of their marriage out there… it’s slightly ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf’ in Boston, which hopefully will be really exciting stuff to dig into.”  Balfe agrees, “The relationship between Claire and Frank is so rich and complex, I’m really looking forward to that.”  After the political intrigue of this season, Heughan says season 3 “feels like a very new chapter,” with trips to tropical climates that are far removed from the chill of Scotland. “There’s a lot of travel involved, and I think that’s the joy of the show — it’s never the same thing, it’s constantly moving, so next season should be quite an adventure.”  What are you most looking forward to seeing in “Outlander” season 3? Weigh in below."
"Justin Bieber told hundreds of people at a Bible study class in Los Angeles that he has “woken up” to the “evils of the music industry” and he needs to take a break from the industry because it is “controlled by the absolute worst kind of people – pedophiles.”  Bieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Saturday 22nd July he shared what he described as a “horrific story” with the congregation and explained why he felt he had to quit his world tour.  Describing a party on tour – attended by the upper echelon of the music business, including executive VPs of development, producers, power agents and international financiers – Bieber said he was encouraged to sexually abuse a young child who had been bought to the party for the sexual gratification of the industry elite.  “I didn’t want to do this. I really didn’t. They said this kid was drugged, it was horrible,” Bieber said, explaining that it was made clear to him that he would gain entry to the “business side of the industry” if he “joined the club” by passing the initiation rites.  “I wouldn’t just be a performer, I’d be a mogul. That path would open up for me, like it did for Jay-Z.”  “It’s the difference between being a millionaire and being a billionaire.”  But Bieber told the congregation that he couldn’t do it.  “To join the club I’d have to do bad things to this poor kid. But then I realized that even that wasn’t enough for them. I’d also have to kill this little child.”  Bieber said he had heard rumors about this type of initiation in the music industry, but he had not been confronted with it before.  “I got told they secretly film these parties. Once they’ve got you on video doing something like that, they own you.”  Bieber said his conscience is clear because he didn’t participate, but the fate of the drugged child is haunting him.  “They said this kid was raped by a few different guys. They said he was bleeding. I got out of there but I heard he died and that haunts me.”  This allegation from Justin Bieber adds to the wave of accusations made by celebrities and musicians about the real nature of the music and entertainment industry elite. Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood have both gone on record exposing the pedophilia at the heart of Hollywood.  According to Elijah Wood, innocent young lives are destroyed to satisfy “people with parasitic interests” who “see you as their prey.” In an interview with the Sunday Times, Wood dropped a series of bombshells about the pedophiles that run the industry, noting that “Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized.”  If you read the Washington Post or watch CNN, pedophilia is not a problem, and those who talk about it are tinfoil hat wearing kooks perpetuating ‘fake news.’ But more and more stars are coming forward with similar stories about the depraved Hollywood and music industry system.  In recent months Nicole Kidman and Lindsay Lohan also spoke out about pedophilia in Hollywood. Close friends of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington claim the recently deceased pair were working on exposing the pedophile ring working at the heart of the music industry – and it cost them their lives.  Justin Bieber shocked his fans by cancelling his world tour and announcing that he needed some time away from the music industry. But as more information comes to light, it appears he made the best possible decision."

"Phaedra Parks can cross “Housewife” off her long list of job titles.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The 43-year-old attorney, mortician, philanthropist and mother of two will not be returning to The Real Housewives of Atlanta for its 10th season, multiple sources confirm to PEOPLE.  Her dismissal from the hit Bravo show, which was first reported by E! Online, comes after a tough four-part reunion, in which she admitted to spreading inflammatory accusations to Porsha Williams that said Kandi Burruss and her husband Todd Tucker had planned on drugging Williams and their mutual friend Shamea Morton in order to take advantage of them sexually.  Williams had come under fire for repeating the accusations throughout the season because she believed the claims had come directly from Burruss. Problem was, Parks had only heard the information from a still-unnamed source.  “I repeated it because I heard it,” Parks said in the final episode of the reunion. “Something was brought to me. I repeated what someone told me … I shouldn’t have repeated it … I screwed up … I’m sorry.”  Phaedra Parks, Porsha Williams, Shereé Whitfield and Shamea Morton Annette Brown/Bravo/NBC  Many had wondered how Parks might be able to return to the show next season, with most of the cast accusing her of being a liar.  Parks previously told PEOPLE that if offered, she’d still want to come back to the show.  “I would love to continue,” she said. “Obviously the show documents your journey, and every journey has its ups and downs.”  “It’s not always accurate, of course,” she added. “But for the moments that they capture something that’s real — like being a mom, helping someone out, having a very sensitive moment on television that turns into something beautiful — that’s the legacy that counts when it comes to reality TV. The moments that change people’s lives.”  Reps for both Parks and Bravo had no comment on next season’s casting.  RELATED VIDEO: Andy Cohen’s Pick for the Most Absurd Real Housewives Business Ever  Parks joined RHOA during it’s third season, and quickly became beloved by fans for her Southern Belle charm and her hilarious one-liners.  Over her six seasons on the show, the reality star let fans into some of the most intimate moments of her life — from the birth of her two sons (Ayden, 6, and Dylan, 3) to the downfall of her marriage to estranged husband Apollo Nida (who is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to bank fraud and identity theft in May 2014, the same year they split).  Filming for the Real Housewives of Atlanta‘s landmark 10th season is expected to begin in Georgia soon."

"FUNNYGAL Melissa McCarthy’s eye is filled with blood — and now a medical expert fears the shocking issue is a sign she’s going blind from a secret illness.  Recent photos show the five foot-two Mike & Molly sensation smiling despite the ugly red stain in her eye caused by an exploding blood vessel.  Dr. Charles Seltzer warns, “Broken blood vessels can be an indicator of something else that’s more serious, like diabetes, which could lead to loss of sight.  “She needs to see an eye doctor.”  Her life could also be in danger from a series of health issues, says the diet and weightloss specialist who has not treated Melissa.  “Diabetes, high blood pressure, a blood-clotting disorder, heart attack, stroke — if you have any one of those and you’re not doing something about it, they can kill,” Seltzer says.  Before her eye problem, friends feared the 47-year-old Ghostbusters star was digging her own grave with a knife and fork. But when she hit a scale-crushing 255 pounds, Melissa started an exercise program and low-carb, high-protein diet. She shed 75 pounds.  But the weight crept back on.

"Portia de Rossi said on Wednesday she had an uncomfortable encounter with Steven Seagal during an office audition, making her the second actress to accuse the actor of sexual misconduct in the last week.  The 44-year-old actress tweeted that Seagal “unzipped his leather pants” while they were in his office. Rossi was auditioning for a role in the actor’s movie.  “My final audition for a Steven Segal [sic] movie took place in his office. He told me how important it was to have chemistry off-screen as he sat me down and unzipped his leather pants,” she recalled.  “I ran out and called my agent. Unfazed, she replied, ‘Well, I didn’t know if he was your type,’” she said.  Ellen DeGeneres, de Rossi’s wife of nine years, tweeted she was “proud of” her wife for opening up about the alleged encounter.  De Rossi is the second actress to accuse Seagal of inappropriate behavior in the last week. “The Good Wife” actress Julianna Margulies recalled when she “squirmed” her way out of being alone with Seagal in a hotel room.  “He made sure that I saw his gun, which I had never seen a gun in real life,” Margulies said in an interview Friday on SiriusXM. “I got out of there unscathed. It’s a long story… but I never was raped, and I never was harmed, and I don’t know how I got out of that hotel room.”  She added, “It always starts with, ‘I’m a healer, I want to massage you.’ I sort of squirmed my way out.”"

"Kellyanne Conway slammed officials who in the wake of the latest historic mass shooting were calling for action on gun legislation. | Matt Rourke/AP Conway: Politicizing Texas shooting 'disrespectful to the dead'  White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Monday criticized Democrats for ""pointing fingers"" and calling for increased gun control measures in response to the deadly Texas shooting over the weekend, saying the quick reaction is ""disrespectful to the dead.""  ""The rush to judgment, particularly by people who just see politics and Trump derangement in every single thing they do, it doesn't help the victims, and it's disrespectful to the dead,"" Conway said during an appearance on ""Fox & Friends"" Monday morning.  Story Continued Below  Conway lamented Sunday's lethal shooting, which left at least 26 dead after a gunman opened fire on the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, during a worship service on Sunday — the deadliest mass shooting in state history. ""There is evil among us,"" she said.  The counselor to the president also slammed officials who, in the wake of the latest historic mass shooting, were calling for action on gun legislation.  “It's so beyond any type of reasonable response that anyone should have — why people see politics immediately,"" she said, hitting liberal politicians and celebrities for ""taking to Twitter in the comfort of their very luxurious lives and pointing fingers.""

President Donald Trump weighed in on the tragedy while speaking at a news conference in Japan, during his first major diplomatic trip to Asia, calling the incident ""a mental health problem at the highest level.""  “This was a very deranged individual,” Trump said in addressing reporters alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, adding, “We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. This isn’t a guns situation.”  It was unclear what led Trump to say the shooting was a result of ""mental health."" Officials are still investigating the motive behind the shooter's outburst.  The president said it was too soon to rehash the gun control debate, though, echoing a common refrain from Republican officials after recent mass casualty shootings.  The White House similarly dismissed calls for fast action in response to the lethal Las Vegas shooting last month that claimed the lives of more than 50 and left more than 500 injured. ""I think that we can have those policy conversations, but today is not that day,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the day after the shooting during a White House news briefing."

"Lady Gaga Alberto E. Rodriguez/ Getty Images  The INSIDER Summary:  Lady Gaga's new documentary will discuss her struggles with chronic pain and fibromyalgia.  The singer has previously spoken about her battle with the disorder on social media.  Fibromyalgia causes widespread pain and is not curable.  In 2016, Lady Gaga revealed an Instagram post is 2016 that she suffers from ""chronic pain"" but never gave more details. But in her upcoming documentary, ""Gaga: Five Foot Two,"" the singer and actress dives a little deeper into the disease she's been battling for some time.  The singer recently tweeted that the chronic pain she deals with is fibromyalgia, a disorder that is more common than people may think. In the tweet, she wrote that she wants to, "" help raise awareness and connect people who have it,"" CNN reports.  Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder that causes tenderness to touch or pain over the body.  According to the National Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Association, the disease can vary in intensity and affects people ""physically, mentally, and socially."" People suffering from this disorder, which often manifests itself in adolescence or young adulthood, feel more pain than would be typically expected. Because of this pain, a few common symptoms include fatigue, tenderness, sleep disorders, memory problems, depression, and stiffness.  The foundation also reports that 10 million Americans suffer from fibromyalgia with a ratio of eight to two ratio, women over men.  There is no cure for this pain, and it is a lifelong condition.  The disease can occur on its own but has also been linked to stress, repetitive injuries, and other diseases like Lupus, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Researchers are working to determine definitively what causes people to develop this pain in the hopes of finding a cure or better treatment options.  Healthline reports that treatment typically goes beyond medication and focuses on improving quality of life through self-care and lifestyle changes. Medication options vary from antidepressants and sleep aids to pain relievers and narcolepsy drugs.  Other celebs have opened up about their struggle with chronic pain or fibromyalgia.  George Clooney Getty Images/Chip Somodevilla  In addition to Gaga, Morgan Freeman has specifically spoken about dealing with fibromyalgia. In an interview with Esquire, the actor described the pain. ""Up and down the arm,"" he said. ""That's where it gets so bad. Excruciating."" The actor doesn't let this pain stop him from doing some of the things he enjoys like golfing or walking, but he can't fly pilot jets or drive.  According to ABC, other stars that have suffered from chronic pain include Paula Abdul, George Clooney, and Tobey Maguire.  In a press conference, Gaga said that the ""pain is a microphone"" and it ""does me no good unless I transform it into something that is,"" Variety reports. Here's hoping ""Gaga: Five Foot Two,"" which will be available on September 22 on Netflix, inspires others suffering to transform the pain."

Talented: Laura made her major film debut playing Peter Parker's high school girlfriend Liz in last year's Spider-Man: Homecoming  Just over a week ago Justin opened up about his split from ex wife Jennifer Aniston, telling the New York Times their separation was different than a normal couple's would have been because it was so 'amicable'.  '[It] doesn't have that seismic shift of an ordinary couple, where everything is, like, you have to tear a baby in half,' he said.  'Neither one of us is dead, neither one of us is looking to throw hatchets at each other. It's more like, it's amicable. It's boring, but, you know, we respected each other enough that it was as painless as it could be. It was heartbreaking only in a sense that the friendship would not be the same, as far as just the day to day.'  The Maniac star went on: 'But the friendship is shifting and changing, you know, so that part is something that we're both very proud of.'"
"CLOSE According to the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office, actor Ryan Phillippe will not face criminal charges despite his ex-girlfriend accusing him of being violent towards her. USA TODAY  A former girlfriend of Ryan Phillippe has accused him of throwing her down a staircase. (Photo: Jordan Strauss, Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)  Actor Ryan Phillippe will not face criminal charges in the domestic violence case that resulted in a lawsuit being filed by a former girlfriend.  Frank Mateljan, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office, told USA TODAY that his office will not be pursuing the matter further.  ""The City Attorney's Office was referred this matter following an investigation by the LAPD,"" he said in a statement. ""After a thorough review, the matter was set for a City Attorney office hearing, during which both parties were present, detailed the incident, were advised on the law and given guidance as to how to avoid similar incidents in the future.  ""Separate hearings were held in August and September. No further action has been scheduled following our office hearing, though we do reserve the right to file charges up to one year after the incident.""  On Monday, model Elsie Hewitt, 21, sued the actor for $1 million, alleging assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Phillippe denies the accusations.  ""The claims are false,"" Phillippe's rep, Nicole Perna, said to USA TODAY in a statement.  Later in the evening, he expanded on his thoughts in a tweet confirmed by Perna.  ""I am saddened and disgusted by these false allegations being circulated about me,"" he wrote. ""At the time these allegations were initially made, I fully cooperated with law enforcement and a thorough investigation was conducted.""  He continued, ""As a man, raised by women, in a household where women's right's, feminism and advocacy were very much at the forefront, I am sickened that my name can be found in any article where domestic violence of any kind is being alleged.""  Hewitt's lawsuit, obtained by USA TODAY, says Phillippe, who is 22 years her senior, became increasingly possessive and violent towards her (often while under the influence) during their three-month relationship.  The document states that during their relationship, she observed Phillippe, 43, ""repeatedly abusing a panoply of legal and illegal drugs, including without limitation: cocaine, ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms and steroids.""  Things reached a boiling point over the July 4th holiday, according to the suit, when Hewitt and a friend came to his house to pick up personal items she would need for an upcoming modeling job.  Phillippe, she describes, was ""discernibly drunk and high"" at the time, and became increasingly ""agitated and hostile."" In an effort to diffuse the situation, Hewitt asked to speak with him privately upstairs.  When that plan failed, she called her friend to come upstairs while she cleared out her belongings from his bedroom.  At that point, the lawsuit says, Phillippe grabbed Hewitt by the arm (""so tightly that his grip left heavy bruises on her arm hours later"") and ""violently threw her down his staircase as hard as he could.""  She made a second trip up the stairs only to be cornered, kicked and thrown down the stairs again. As and her friend fled, he cursed and screamed ""get the (expletive) out of my house, you crazy (expletive)!""  Soon afterward, she sought treatment at the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where police filed a report, noting ""visible injuries to (Hewitt's) legs, back, arms, shoulder and face"" and granted her a week-long emergency protective order, which was served at Phillippe's home on July 6.  The day beforehand, Hewitt says he texted her saying he was ""so sad"" and contacted her friends via private message on social media that he was ""heartbroken"" and ""in disbelief"" that police had come to his home.  ""I can't believe she'd do this to me,"" he allegedly wrote, adding he ""would never hurt her like she's claiming. I didn't hit or punch or kick her.""  The friend who witnessed the encounter replied, ""I saw the whole thing Ryan, you literally were grabbing her and threw her down the stairs.""  Hewitt is seeking $1 million in punitive damages, citing emotional distress and the impact physical attack had on her ability to work as a model since her ""income and career (are) largely contingent upon her physical features.""  Phillippe's publicist released a statement flatly denying the account.  In his tweet, Phillippe noted, ""I have been a public figure for almost 25 years and many untrue things have been said or written about me in the past. That is something you learn to accept if you choose a profession like mine. This time is different.""  He also took offense at the notion of using this type of accusation for personal gain: ""Domestic violence is a very real and tragic issue for many women the world over and should never be used to vengefully slander or as a ploy for monetary gain. This is wrong. This is not who I am. Every one of my accuser's allegations (is) false.""  Phillippe was previously married to Reese Witherspoon, who filed separation papers in 2006 after seven years of marriage. Their divorce was finalized in 2008.  They have two children together: 18-year-old daughter Ava and 13-year-old son Deacon. He also has a 6-year-old daughter from his relationship with Pitch Perfect actress Alexis Knapp.  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2yc3HrN"

All proceeds from the annual fundraising event — founded by Miami-based DJ Irie — go towards helping the Irie Foundation provide scholarship opportunities and mentoring programs to at-risk youth living in South Florida.  “Of course he’s aware of the headlines surrounding him and Katie but he doesn’t seem worried about that at all,” a source tells PEOPLE. “He’s just his happy, hilarious self.”  DJ Irie and Jamie Foxx Dylan Rives  “Jamie is in town to support his friend Irie and just enjoy a guys’ weekend,” the source explains. “He never misses this but he’s particularly happy for a little escape this year.”  “He got in Friday night and headed straight to Top Golf to meet up with his boys and enjoy the festivities,” the source continues, adding that while there are “women around,” Foxx isn’t “flirting much this time around.”  “He seems just happy to get away and kick back,” the insider remarks.  During the fun-filled evening, Foxx and friends joined Ludacris onstage to perform one of the rapper’s biggest hits, “Move Bitch.”  RELATED: Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes Step Out Separately After Denying Rumors About Their Relationship  Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Kevin Mazur/Getty Images  Though the Beat Shazam host and Dawson’s Creek star, 39, first being seen dancing with one another in the Hamptons in 2013, have never confirmed their relationship, they’ve been stepping out more often since a photographer captured a rare photo of the pair together, walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach in September.

The rapper (and Kim's husband) recently tweeted a screenshot of texts he received from Jenner, where she thanked him for sending Yeezy looks to her rumored girlfriend Sophia Hutchins.  ""So awesome.

"Kylie Jenner is starting to slowly return to public life, even if all she wants to do is stay home with her new baby, daughter Stormi Webster.  Jenner – who welcomed her first child with boyfriend Travis Scott 11 days ago – took a brief break from mommy duties to attend her friend Heather Sanders‘ baby shower on Sunday.

Sanders’ and the 20-year-old star describe each other as “pregnant sisters”, so Jenner pulled herself away from her little one for only the second time since the baby arrived – Jenner stepped out on Saturday with BFF Jordyn Woods for the first time since giving birth in black bicycle shorts and a fanny pack.  Kylie Jenner headed to Heather Sander's baby shower  On Monday, the star shared her baby shower look, posting two pictures on her Instagram. For the shower, Jenner remained relatively covered up, wearing a red Gosha Rubchinskiy X Adidas tracksuit with white sneakers. Eagle-eyed fans spotted a ring on her left ring finger, though the star has been known to fake us out with different rings worn on that finger before.  RELATED VIDEO: Selfies! Workouts!

Although Jenner hasn’t wanted to do anything except “hold her baby” since the birth of her daughter on Feb. 1, the star is enjoying slowly starting to get back out in public.  “Kylie is doing great,” a source told PEOPLE. “She has left her baby at home a couple of times for short outings. She is very happy and looks great, too. Things with Travis are the same. He is great with the baby when he is around.”  A source told PEOPLE that Jenner star loves being a mom so far and is “still over the moon” about it. “All she talks about is her baby girl,” the insider said. “She is surrounded by her and Travis’ family. Everyone is pitching in and helping Kylie so she can do things like shower. But all she wants to do is hold her baby.”"
"If a picture speaks a thousand words, then the Instagram accounts of Jennifer Lopez and boyfriend Alex Rodriguez could tell one epic story. Within hours of each other on Jan. 24, the former Yankee slugger posted a photo of a cryptic quote: “There’s nothing wrong with making a mistake, what’s wrong is not making the effort to make it right,” and the Shades of Blue star shared a photo of a gigantic bouquet of flowers Alex had sent her. The next day, she uploaded a selfie and captioned the photo, “It’s all in God’s hands always,” along with the hashtag #letgoandletgod. According to an insider, “That was aimed directly at Alex.”  Hollywood’s hottest duo is on the verge of flaming out. Jennifer, 48, is privately questioning her relationship with her boyfriend of nearly a year after learning he’s still in touch with former fling Lauren Hunter, a fitness model, who last year claimed in an interview that Alex, 42, had been sexting her for months — including while he was dating J.Lo. Recently, “someone went to Jennifer with new details that Alex was still texting with Lauren, and that’s what made Jennifer lose it,” the insider tells In Touch. “Of course, he said it wasn’t physical, and maybe it wasn’t, but in Jennifer’s book, that’s still cheating. They were head-over-heels in love and planning to get engaged. Now Alex’s actions have jeopardized everything.”  The damage runs deep. Jennifer, who’s endured three failed marriages, “was heartbroken to hear that Alex was talking to Lauren,” says the insider. “Even though they didn’t meet in person, Jennifer considered it a betrayal. Now she has friends and family watching out for her best interests, which means checking in and asking about Alex’s antics.”  She has good reason to worry. Last June, a month after Jennifer and Alex made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in NYC, Lauren claimed in a bombshell interview that she was in frequent contact with the ex-athlete, whom she met at an Equinox gym in 2011. “A week before his relationship with Jennifer was announced, he was asking me to go to Miami,” she claimed. “He never even mentioned her.” Lauren also alleged that Alex (who has kids Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis) cheated on then-girlfriend Cameron Diaz with her in 2011. Jennifer “would be an idiot to believe he’d be faithful,” she said. She also called Jennifer too vanilla for him. “I don’t think he’s sexually attracted to her,” she dished. “In bed... he's probably picturing me.""  Jennifer, mom to nine-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex Marc Anthony, turned a blind eye to the initial interview. Now, she’s not sure what to believe. “Jennifer’s still on the fence,” says the insider. “She can either cut her losses and walk away from the relationship, or she can fight for it. I think she’ll fight for it.”  More from In Touch  Alex Rodriguez Encourages New Girlfriend Jennifer Lopez to “Sex up” Her Wardrobe (EXCLUSIVE)  Jennifer Lopez Hints That She Has Made a Sex Tape — Watch the Scandalous Clip!

"A MAN marrying a stranger on a reality TV show was so disappointed by his new wife's appearance that he muttered ""oh s**t"" the moment she appeared at the top of the aisle.  Aussie Sean D, 38, was saying I Do to a total stranger on Married At First Sight, a programme that sees total strangers meeting at the altar after being paired up for life by a team of scientists and psychologists.  Channel 9 6 Sean D muttered ""oh s**t"" when he first locked eyes on his new bride  But while single mum Jo, 39, was thrilled with her new hubby - later exclaiming ""Jackpot! I've won the lotto!"" - he had a face like thunder for the entire ceremony and the reception.  Things even took a further dive when after kissing his new missus, he wiped her lipstick off his mouth and said ""gross"".  Speaking to The Fix, Sean shared the criteria he had given producers for his dream partner.  He said: ""Someone who’s funny. Someone’s who loyal. Someone who wants to have good fun. Having someone to go and have fun with and do different things and learn different things. And someone who's trustworthy.""  Channel 9 6 He was unable to hide his disappointment, although he was matched with someone who was 100% his type on paper  Channel 9 6 Jo was delighted to see her hunky new husband and said she felt like she had won the lottery  But despite Jo ticking all the boxes, he simply didn't fancy her.  Sadly for Jo, she really did think she had struck gold with her mystery man.  At the wedding she said: ""He's got kind eyes. He seems genuine. I fancy him.  ""This could work. My expectations have been met and then some. To infinity and beyond... Sean D and Jo sitting in a tree.  Channel 9 6 Jo couldn't stop talking about how good looking her new man was  ""My expectations have been met, and then some. To infinity and beyond. Winning! Jackpot! I've won the lotto!  ""The experts have been spot on! He is for me. He couldn't be any more perfect.""  But Sean felt very differently, which made for awkward viewing for people at home.  He said, ""Um, she's probably not what I imagined, no.  Channel 9 6 Later Sean looked despondently at the table as Jo stared at him adoringly  ""There's not like a massive spark straight away, but I'm sure she's feeling the same way.""  People tuned in at home were on the edge of their seats as the mismatched pair continued to totally misread one another's body language and reactions to each other.  All I really wanna watch is Jo & that sad sack Sean #MAFS — DeluxeStormBorn™ (@deluxe_tm) January 31, 2018  However, Sean has since explained his frosty reaction to likeable Jo - it's all because of his exercise addict ex-girlfriend who he's still a bit hung up on.  He said that after she got addicted to exercise, their 10 year relationship ended and he was stuck caring for their plethora of pets including llamas and cats - and he is still traumatised and tired.  Sean said: ""We had a five-acre property together, and she ran out of time for me and the animals.  Channel 9 6 Sean later described kissing his wife as ""gross""  ""It was really hard because I had to take responsibility of the farm. I got all the animals. When we broke up, we had nine dogs, two alpacas, and two horses.  ""It was difficult breaking up, it wasn't like either of us did anything wrong - there was no cheating or anything like that.  ""She became a fitness freak but was just crazy. We slowly drifted apart and that was it, we were done.""

"Barring a fluke, Aquaman will probably cross $500 million worldwide sometime today or very early tomorrow. The DC Films superhero flick has earned $483m worldwide, including $72.7m in its domestic debut, so it should be over/under $80m domestic by the end of today. For reference, National Treasure fell 40% on its first Monday on Christmas Eve after a $44m debut weekend in 2007 while The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which opened a week earlier in 2012, fell 60% on day four after a then-record $84m Fri-Sun haul. So, yeah, barring an unexpected collapse, the Jason Momoa/Amber Heard adventure is already a sizable hit for the Dream Factory, and it’s on course to be their biggest domestic and global grosser of 2018.  It is standard practice after any DC Films movie to examine what its success (or relative failure) means for the brand as a whole. It may be too early to explore the long-term impact, but at a glance, DC Films is now in a position where not every film has to justify the entire IP or the overall fate of the studio. Warner Bros. had a pretty damn good 2018, offering a slew of mid-priced domestic winners (A Star Is Born, Crazy Rich Asians, Ocean’s 8) and big-budget tentpoles that did okay in North America and broke big overseas (Ready Player One, The Meg, Rampage) and thus finally declaring that they won’t be entirely defined by DC Films and the J.K. Rowling brand.  One thing the relative commercial and critical success of Aquaman means is that the series won’t necessarily live or die by the fate of each movie. Maybe Shazam will be another goofy treat, and since it’s from New Line as well as Warner Bros., I’m presuming it’s budgeted closer to The Fellowship of the Ring than The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Maybe Todd Phillips' Joker will be a halfway-decent 1980s crime drama that happens to be a Joker origin story. Or perhaps not. But each new film will, as long as some of them are decent (and WB has other IP and non-IP hits to crow about), be allowed to stand on its own without much concern about the overall fate of the brand being taken into account.  Coincidentally enough, today marks 33 months since the release of Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. After Snyder’s Man of Steel earned mixed reviews and grossed “just” $668 million worldwide, Man of Steel 2 morphed first into a Superman sequel that happened to involve Batman and eventually into an official backdoor pilot for the DC Films franchise. So the poor reviews and quick-kill box office ($873m but from a $422m global launch) wasn’t just about whether the movie made money (it did) or justified itself artistically (that’s a coin toss, especially in its compromised theatrical cut), but how it laid the groundwork for the sequels and spin-offs to come. Much of the conversation revolved around what the film said about the overall DC Comics film franchise.  This is what happens when a studio positions a new biggie as not just a big movie (or even a big sequel) but as a launching pad for a would-be cinematic universe. It was a distinctly less stand-alone movie than, for example, Sony’s The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (whose marketing emphasized the barely-there cinematic universe implications). Superman (Henry Cavill) met Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg). We briefly met The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher). The film set up a looming threat from Apokolips and hinted at an endgame similar to Injustice: Gods Among Us (a popular DC Comics fighting video game where Superman goes world-crushingly rogue after Lois Lane is murdered).  Oh, and it ended with Clark Kent perishing in battle with the presumption that he would be resurrected in Justice League. The grim, hyper-violent and barely comprehensible sequel was discussed in terms of its quality and in terms of what it meant for the overall DC Films franchise. It earned nearly $900 million but was so divisively received that it caused significant changes for Suicide Squad (which ended up being recut by the company that produced the first crowd-pleasing theatrical trailer) and Justice League (where Joss Whedon eventually took over from Zack Snyder and delivered a soft remake of The Avengers). As a backdoor pilot for a cinematic universe that was intended to replace WB’s Harry Potter grosses and stand toe-to-toe with the MCU, it was a disaster.  But the success of James Wan’s Aquaman, both critically and (thus far) commercially, means two big things for the DC Films franchise. First, it means that they can keep the established continuity intact while going in a different direction (or many different directions) for the likes of Cathy Yan's Birds of Prey, David Sanberg's Shazam and Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman 1984. It may not have “saved the DCEU,” but it most certainly saved the DC Films continuity and prevented a more overt reboot. Ditto (presumably) Shazam, whose trailer explicitly references the events of Batman v Superman even while telling a more kid-friendly adventure fantasy. Secondly, for what it’s worth, it means we can now judge Dawn of Justice as its own thing instead of a foundation for a rickety house.  As a stand-alone film, even the 180-minute (and R-rated) “ultimate edition” has many of the same problems it did 2.5-years-ago. The critical title fight is still based on miscommunication and misdirection, so it’s not really the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight wanting to beat the hell out of each other. The first two hours is mostly just Lex Luthor (an underrated turn from Eisenberg) slaughtering innocents behind the scenes while Batman and Superman blame each other and brood. The desire to make Luthor into a full-blown puppet master makes the plot more complicated and confusing than it needed to be. And, like Man of Steel (and Chris Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises), the film’s first plot-filled/character-centric half is more compelling than its action-packed second half.  Absent the misguided notion of introducing a four-quadrant super-franchise with a film like Batman v Superman, the picture works as an Elseworlds movie. It is still one of the most beautiful-looking superhero movies I’ve ever seen, and how I wish Larry Fong had shot Justice League too. While too many superhero team-up movies and shows tend to isolate their heroes and minimize their contact with the outside world, Batman v Superman has a sprawling supporting cast and is as much about the regular people as it is about Batman and Superman. As a visually-majestic and highly quotable superhero drama that blends gritty realism with apocalyptic fantasy while trying to examine Superman’s role in a world where his every action is politicized, it’s at worst a noble failure.  Like Ang Lee’s Hulk or even Jon Favreau’s Iron Man 2 (which is a superhero sequel as a sitcom bottle episode), Zack Snyder’s second DC Films movie is an engrossing misfire both for what it attempts and beautiful it often looks and sounds. There’s certainly nothing else like it in the sub-genre. It will likely age well as its own thing now that it no longer carries the burden of an entire cinematic universe (and arguably an entire movie studio) on its doomed, misguided shoulders. That it turned out to be the most potent (and sadly accurate) political metaphor for the 2016 presidential election (Batman = Sanders, Superman = Clinton, Luthor = Trump) of that year only adds to its skewed legacy. And now Aquaman has set it free."
"Gotti is a 2018 American biographical crime drama film directed by Kevin Connolly, and written by Lem Dobbs and Leo Rossi. The film is about the life of New York City mobster John Gotti and his son, and stars John Travolta, Kelly Preston, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Spencer Lofranco, Victor Gojcaj, and Stacy Keach.  The film languished in development hell for several years with numerous directors and actors, including Barry Levinson and Al Pacino, attached at various points. Principal photography finally began in July 2016 in Cincinnati, Ohio and concluded in Brooklyn, New York in February 2017.  The film was originally set to be released in the United States on December 15, 2017, but, just two weeks prior, Lionsgate, the slated distributor, sold the film back to its producers and studio, delaying its release.[6] On March 12, 2018,[7] its new release date was announced for June 15, 2018 by Vertical Entertainment and MoviePass Ventures, after premiering at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival. Gotti was negatively reviewed by critics, who lamented the writing, aesthetics, and performances, although its use of makeup received some praise; Travolta's performance received mixed reviews.[8] It is one of the few films to hold an approval rating of 0% on the website Rotten Tomatoes.[9][10][11]  Plot [ edit ]  The film chronicles the three-decade reign of crime boss John Gotti, and his rise as the head of the Gambino Crime Family in New York City, along with his son, John Jr., and his loyal wife, Victoria.  Cast [ edit ]  Production [ edit ]  Development history [ edit ]  In September 2010, Fiore Films announced that it had secured the rights from Gotti Jr. to produce a movie about his life.[12] The film, tentatively titled Gotti: In the Shadow of My Father, was to be directed by Barry Levinson, who eventually left the project. Nick Cassavetes and Joe Johnston were then also attached at different points to direct, as were Al Pacino, Lindsay Lohan and Ben Foster to star in various roles.[13] Joe Pesci was cast as Angelo Ruggiero early in development and gained 30 pounds in order to properly portray him. After having his salary cut and being recast as Lucchese underboss Anthony Casso, he sued Fiore Films for $3 million; the case was settled out of court.[14][15] Chazz Palminteri, who had played Paul Castellano in the TNT made-for-TV film Boss of Bosses, was also initially cast to reprise Gotti's predecessor.[16]  Casting [ edit ]  On September 8, 2015, it was announced that the project was moving forward with Kevin Connolly as director.[17] Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films, Fiore Films and Herrick Entertainment would be financing the film, with Lionsgate Premiere handling the domestic distribution rights.[17]  On July 27, 2016, the complete cast for the film was announced. It included Kelly Preston as Gotti's wife Victoria; Stacy Keach as Aniello Dellacroce, the underboss of the Gambino crime family who mentored Gotti; Pruitt Taylor Vince as Angelo Ruggiero, a deferential friend of Gotti; Spencer Lofranco as John Gotti Jr., Gotti's son; William DeMeo as Sammy Gravano, Gotti's right hand man who later became an FBI informant and helped them in bringing down Gotti; Leo Rossi as Bartholomew ""Bobby"" Boriello, Gotti's enforcer; Victor Gojcaj as Father Murphy, with Tyler Jon Olson and Megan Leonard.[18]  Filming [ edit ]  Principal photography on the film began in Cincinnati, Ohio, on July 25, 2016, with locations including Springfield Township. The locations were staged to resemble setting of the film, New York City.[19][20] Filming also took place on Jonfred Court in Finneytown, and Indian Hill.[20][21] Filming was also done at Butler County Jail.[22]  The film's shooting was previously scheduled to take place in New York City, because of its setting there, but it was relocated to Cincinnati. One reason to relocate was Ohio's revised Motion Picture Tax Credit to benefit films' creators.[23] Filming for some scenes took place in Brooklyn on February 21, 2017, concluding principal photography.[24]  Release [ edit ]  The film was originally set to be released in a limited release and through video on demand on December 15, 2017, through Lionsgate Premiere. Producers began seeking a new distributor in order for the film to receive a wide theatrical release, as opposed to the original release it was initially intended to have, with Lionsgate selling the film back to the producers and studio.[25][26] On March 12, 2018, Connolly announced that the film would be released on June 15, 2018.[27] On April 12, 2018, it was announced Vertical Entertainment was the film's new distributor.[2] On April 25, 2018, it was announced that MoviePass Ventures, a subsidiary of MoviePass, acquired an equity stake in the film and will participate in the revenue generated from the film.[28][29] The film premiered at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival on May 15, 2018.[1]  Reception [ edit ]  Box office [ edit ]  Gotti began its limited release in 503 theaters and was projected to make $1–2 million in its opening weekend. It made $105,000 from Thursday night previews at 350 theaters and a total of $1.7 million in its opening weekend, finishing 12th.[13] According to their own reports, MoviePass accounted for 40% of tickets sold, leading one independent studio head to tell Deadline Hollywood: ""It used to be in distribution, we’d all gossip whether a studio was buying tickets to their own movie to goose their opening. But in the case of MoviePass, there’s no secret: They’re literally buying the tickets to their own movie!""[30] In its second weekend the film dropped 53% and made $812,000, finishing 12th.[31]  Critical response [ edit ]  Gotti was not screened in advance for critics,[32] but the Cannes premiere was attended by reviewers from IndieWire and The Hollywood Reporter, who both gave the film negative reviews .[33] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 0% based on 39 reviews, and an average rating of 2.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Fuhgeddaboudit.""[34] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 24 out of 100, based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating ""generally unfavorable reviews"".[35]  Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, writing: ""...it's not only that the film is pretty terrible: poorly written, devoid of tension, ridiculous in spots and just plain dull in others. But the fact that it mostly portrays John Gotti as a loving family man and altogether likable guy, and his son John Gotti Jr. as a victim of government persecution, may be a first in the history of the genre.""[4] The New York Post's Johnny Oleksinski called the film ""the worst mob movie of all-time"" and wrote, ""...the long-awaited biopic about the Gambino crime boss' rise from made man to top dog took four directors, 44 producers and eight years to make. It shows. The finished product belongs in a cement bucket at the bottom of the river.""[36] Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film one out of four stars and said, ""Insane testimonials from Gotti supporters at the end are as close as this [film] will ever get to good reviews.""[37]  Rotten Tomatoes controversy [ edit ]  Observers were quick to note a large disparity on Rotten Tomatoes, between the audience approval score of 80% and the 0% critics' score during the film's opening weekend.[38][39][40][41][42] As of August 12, 2018 , the audience score was down 27% to a score of 53%.[34]  On June 19, Dan Murrell of Screen Junkies noted that the disparity ""made no sense"" and suspected vote manipulation on behalf of the studio.[39] Accusations against the production studio and marketing team increased after the release of a marketing push suspected to be trying to hit back at the critics. The campaign proclaimed to consumers to ignore the ""... trolls behind a keyboard"",[42] and ""Audiences loved Gotti but critics don't want you to see it... The question is why??? Trust the people and see it for yourself!""[38][41][39][40] Observers also noted the abnormally high number of reviews, 7,000, compared to other films that did better at the box office that weekend, such as Incredibles 2 which logged 7,600 reviews and grossed 105 times more than Gotti.[39][41]  Rotten Tomatoes staff issued a statement stating they didn't find any evidence of tampering and that ""All of the ratings and reviews were left by active accounts.""[42] As of June 19, 32 of the 54 written reviews were found to be from first-time reviewers on the site, who had also only left a review for Gotti itself, and 45 of the accounts were created the same month.[39] Many of the accounts also wrote a review for American Animals, which along with Gotti are the only films to be owned by MoviePass through its company MoviePass Ventures,[39][41] which was responsible for 40% of tickets sold.[30] Jim Vorel of Paste suggested this was done to try to prop up MoviePass's ""unlimited movies"" business model.[39]"
"Alex Pall, the Grammy-winning deejay who is one half of the powerhouse EDM-pop duo The Chainsmokers, found himself in hot water on Tuesday when his now ex-girlfriend Tori Woodward shared photos she alleges are of him kissing another girl.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The pictures of Pall’s apparent indiscretion were captured at a residential location by CCTV and posted to Woodward’s Instagram Stories in a series of snaps — each with a series of savage messages thrown his way.  “Alex is disgusting. Men are trash. Don’t ever forget it,” Woodward wrote on one of the surveillance shots, which Woodward later accused Pall of reporting to Instagram after it was deleted by the social network site.  “They’ll look you in the eyes and tell you they love you. Then destroy you without a second thought,” she captioned another snap, which appeared to show Pall, 32, kissing the mystery woman.  Tori Woodward/Instagram  Reps for Pall and The Chainsmokers did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment about the incident, but Woodward — who has dated Pall since February 2014 — claimed this wasn’t the first time he had been unfaithful throughout their long relationship.  “After hours of begging him for scraps of honesty, I chipped away just enough to confirm that this is not the first time he’s remorsely [sic] cheated on me,” she wrote in another post, listing some of the other women she had questioned him about. “That ‘psycho bitch’ from Vegas, the ‘lame Instagram model’ caught on video and countless others he looked me in the eyes and swore on his life he never touched.”  According to Woodward, Pall allegedly gave her excuses for the infidelity but didn’t apologize.  “Consistent outright denial faded to him explaining that because all men do it, it’s not that bad. And in different words, that because he’s famous now, he had a different rulebook for decency,” she said. “What’s perhaps the most amazing is that he HASN’T EVEN APOLOGIZED.”  “What he has done is everything he possibly can to stop this from coming out, from looking [like] the kind of person who does what he’s done,” she claimed. ” ‘You’re better than this.’ That’s right I am, but you’re not.”  Tori Woodward/Instagram  Tori Woodward/Instagram  Woodward turned her heartbreak into empowerment by her message’s end, writing, “if there was ever a time to hold powerful men accountable for their disgusting behavior, it’s now.”  “Don’t be that guy. Don’t let your friend or brother or business partner be that guy. Basic respect for women in your life should not be such a hard standard to hold each other to,” she said.  She concluded her message by thanking her 40K followers for supporting her in her battle.  “I really appreciate all the kind messages I’ve been getting,” she wrote. “I’m moving on with my life now with the satisfaction that I’m liberated from a horrible person and encourage anyone else in a similar position to know your worth and do the same.”  RELATED VIDEO: Singer/Songwriter Emily Warren on How the Chainsmokers Handle Criticism: ‘It’s Hard [To Not] Get Beat Down by It’  The Chainsmokers, which is made up of Pall and Andrew Taggart, formed in 2012 and went on to find viral success with their 2014 tune “#Selfie.”  Their second EP, 2016’s Collage, brought them into the history books — its single, “Closer,” becoming the longest-running No. 1 hit in the United States in 2016.  The band is nominated for a best pop duo/group performance Grammy at the 2018 awards, for their collaboration with Coldplay, “Something Just Like This,” off their full-length album Memories … Do Not Open."

"Ed Sheeran Reveals 'Love Yourself' Was Originally Written For His New Album 'Divide'  It's no secret that Ed Sheeran had a hand in writing Justin Bieber's megahit ""Love Yourself,"" but the British singer-songwriter recently revealed that the Biebs actually wasn't the original artist in mind when he penned it. Without Bieber, though, the chart-topping tune would still be nonexistent -- or may have never even come to fruition.  “That was a song I had written for Divide. It just wouldn’t have made it,"" Sheeran explained in an interview with Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio Monday morning (Jan. 9). ""And then Justin took it and did his thing on it, and released it as a single and made it what it is. So going from a song that would have never been released to [being] the biggest song of last year -- it just became Billboard's #1 of 2016 of the whole year, and [was] nominated for Song of the Year at the GRAMMYs -- it just shows you that you shouldn’t always write stuff off.”  Sheeran didn't elaborate on what kind of touch Bieber had on the song, but he made sure to give the Purpose singer some credit. ""[Justin] did have input on it, I wouldn’t say it was just all me.""  Those who pay close attention to Bieber's Twitter may have noticed that Sheeran also had a role in another one of the Bieb's 2016 hits: the Major Lazer/MØ collaboration ""Cold Water."" But before Sheeran actually heard the track, he didn't realize he had written yet another smash for Bieber.  “‘Cold Water’ was a weird one because I didn’t even know that song existed,” he explained. “It was a song I must’ve half-written somewhere at a time where I was writing a lot of songs and I did it at Benny Blanco’s house and then I got an email from Diplo just being like, ‘Yo! That ‘Cold Water’ song is dope! Can I have it?’ And I was like, ‘I have no idea what you’re talking about,’ so I just didn’t reply. And then he emailed and was like, “Yo, Justin [Bieber] wants to hop on the ‘Cold Water’ song. Is that cool?’ And I’m just like, ‘What are you talking about?’... And then the song came out and it was number one and I was like ‘Oh, that song!’ I remember doing it, but it was really, really slow. I remember hearing it and being like ‘That kind of sounds like me. Oh wait, it was me.'""  While fans may never get to hear Sheeran's versions of ""Cold Water"" or ""Love Yourself"" -- though he did give one live performance of the latter in December -- they did get a sneak peak last week of what's to come with Divide. Sheeran released ""Castle on the Hill,"" an homage to his hometown of Suffolk, England, and the sexually charged ""Shape of You,"" which both shot to the top of iTunes on Friday (Jan. 6), and set a Spotify record in their first 24 hours of release.  Sheeran revealed on Jan. 12 that Divide will be dropping March 3, and has previously said that he will be sharing a few more new tunes from the LP prior to its release.

"Kim Kardashian will not leave Kanye West despite all the rumors.  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have seen their names mentioned in hundreds of rumors over the years and they aren’t slowing down. Amid the backlash that West is receiving for making controversial comments, reports are coming out that their marriage could be coming to an end soon. Most of those rumors also insinuate that Kardashian is planning to end the marriage.  According to a recent report from Grazia, Kardashian is planning to leave West and even has an “escape plan” to leave him.  “Things between her and Kanye are at a breaking point. The marriage has been under increasing pressure lately and she fears all the controversy Kanye is causing is reflecting negatively on her and her family. There’s concern this marriage is on borrowed time. Kim may come across as his long-suffering wife, but she has been ready to leave on a number of occasions and has had multiple exit strategies in place over the years.”  Gossip Cop has since debunked the rumor that Kardashian has “exit strategies” and an “escape plan” in place to get away from West. She has shown some frustration with his controversial comments, but the two seems to be doing just fine despite all of the rumors.  “None of this adds up to a divorce. In fact, Kardashian’s rep has already gone on record to tell Gossip Cop it’s ‘false’ she’s intending end the marriage. That will be evident in a few days, when the couple marks their fourth wedding anniversary on May 24.”  Kardashian has come out and publicly joked that West is the cause of her first gray hair.  “[Kanye] gave me my first gray hair this week, and I am blaming that on him.”  That is nothing to write home about as far as divorce rumors are concerned. She also went on to state that West is doing well and is out in Wyoming working on new music.  “He’s doing really good. He’s in Wyoming recording, he has a couple of albums coming out, so he’s just focused on that.”  West even took to Twitter to post a picture of Kim with fire emoji’s as the only description. Obviously, he still finds his wife incredibly beautiful.  Rumors are going to continue swirling. Nothing is going to change on the fake report front when it comes to Kardashian and West, but this report can be ignored now that Gossip Cop has debunked it."
"LOS ANGELES—(Spoiler alert: This column has spoilers about the movie, “Interstellar.”) Why was Matt Damon’s casting in “Interstellar” kept under wraps until recently? This question and more were answered by spouses Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas, director and producer, respectively, of the sci-fi/adventure/drama.  “Interstellar,” written by Chris and his brother Jonah, follows a team of explorers as they travel beyond the galaxy to find another home for humankind since Earth is nearing its end.  While “Interstellar” features some stunning visual images of the voyage, the film succeeds more when it delves into relationships through a family, that of Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), an experienced pilot, and his two children, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and Tom (Timothee Chalamet).  ADVERTISEMENT  Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn portray Murph at various ages while Casey Affleck plays the older Tom. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, John Lithgow and Topher Grace round out the cast.  Excerpts from our interview:  Why did you keep Matt Damon’s casting a secret?  Chris Nolan (C): I imagined Doctor Mann a bit like from Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness.” You have Kurtz, this character that you hear about. Everybody says, “Oh, he’s great. Maybe you’ll get to meet him.” I really love the idea for an audience to go, when they see him, “Oh, it’s Matt Damon. It’s going to be okay.”  Matt very graciously agreed to do it. He didn’t have to shoot for long. So we didn’t want to market the film using him because he’s not in it very much. We didn’t want to mislead people. But Matt is a very important part of the movie. It’s fun to watch with an audience who doesn’t know because they haven’t heard about it.  Matt has the most amazing ability to project integrity and warmth. So he turns up in the film and he’s got a plan and it’s all going to be okay. For me, to realize that he’s a frail human being and subject to cowardice and all the terrible weaknesses that we all have… he loved that challenge. I loved what he did with it.  Emma Thomas (E): If people get to watch the film twice, it’s so great watching Matt when you know what’s really going on.  C: When people see Matt’s face, they are like, oh, okay. It’s the lift that the movie needs at that point. Structurally, you have a lot of talk in the 20 minutes before. There’s a lot of negativity, a lot bad things happening. The film is very much going to a dark place at that point. So getting that lift in that way with a great actor and movie star coming on screen, is a good thing.  ADVERTISEMENT  How has the dynamics between the two of you evolved over the years?  E: (Laughs.) We love working together— obviously, with Jonah as well—in a large part because, when you are working with somebody whom you are tied to beyond by blood or marriage, there’s a lack of agenda. Or as Chris once said, I (Emma) have an agenda. He knows what it is. (Laughs.)  But there’s a level of trust that is fantastic, particularly when you are making a big movie like this one. I am often asked as a producer and when Chris is the director, “When do you tell Chris, no, he can’t have that?” The truth is, I am very lucky because Chris is also a producer. He takes every aspect of the filmmaking process very seriously.  He is very helpful in terms of trying to figure out how we make the film for the correct budget, and so on. To me, it’s never absolutely saying no. I tell Chris [how I feel about] certain things. We have discussions. But ultimately, it’s Chris’ vision. He always has a very strong idea of what a film is going to be. He’s the director and it’s very much his film.  I see my job as being very much a facilitator for that, filtering out the things that he doesn’t have to worry about so he can concentrate on getting the film made.  C: It’s fantastic working with people you have worked with a long time and have a high degree of trust in. Emma is always very objective, which is great… I consider Emma a very good gauge (from a moviegoer perspective) because she’s not particularly interested in science-fiction or science. (Laughs.)  I show her the film and ask, “Are you following the emotional threads?” What’s wonderful about working with someone like Emma is that I get an honest opinion, good or bad, instantly. There are no politics to it.  This film’s working title or code name was “Flora’s Letter,” a cinematic letter to your daughter. How is your relationship with your kids reflected in the story?  C: The relationship between a father and his children was clearly something I related to very strongly in the script. Murph was originally written as a boy in my brother’s draft. I changed the character to a girl—just instinctively. It may well be because Flora, my eldest, is a girl.  You do have different relationships with sons and daughters. It really paid off with Matthew because what he was very determined about was that his character’s love for his children should be equal for both. The character having a girl and a boy took the burden off the idea of favoritism. It’s not that he loves Murph more than he loves Tom. There’s just a different relationship. And Murph is more interested in science and the things that have driven her father’s life.  E: Girls are much more complicated, I feel. And boys are rather…  C: Simple.  E: I wouldn’t say simple.  C: That’s what you were thinking, though.  E: It’s complicated. It’s one of my favorite things about the film. I almost don’t think of it as a big, spectacular space movie. I really love the relationships. They feel very real to me as the mother of a girl and boys.  When I watch Mackenzie’s performance, she feels incredibly real to me. I [see] my own daughter in her. Going back to the code name question, I will just say that we have always had code names for our films—our kids’ names. It was just Flora’s turn (laughs).  What are the kids’ ages?  E: Now that’s a difficult question (laughs). They are 12, 11, 9 and 7. Flora is the oldest.  Emma, you were quoted as saying that Chris could not have done this film 12 years ago when you didn’t have kids. Can you both talk about that?  E: I am not saying that Chris couldn’t have made this film 12 years ago. But there’s such a heart, such a reality to the relationships in the movie. The reason we pick a movie to make—because it’s a long process—is that you have to feel an affinity for the story. You have to want to put that story up on the screen.  The place that Chris and I are in now is very different from where we were 12 years ago. This is a story that we are interested in telling. It’s also a movie that is fun to watch with our kids. We watch different movies now than we did 12 years ago because the kids came along.  C: The simple answer is, I don’t know if I couldn’t [have done this movie 12 years ago], but I wouldn’t have and I didn’t. Becoming a father was a very big change in my life, something that affected my outlook and the kind of stories that I am interested in telling and in ways that I would have never been able to predict and not in simple ways.  We did a press conference yesterday and Matthew was asked about being a father. He said he could have played the part even before he had kids. What I didn’t say to him because I didn’t want to embarrass him—but I am going to embarrass him now—is that I would have found it very difficult to cast someone who wasn’t a father. Matthew was absolutely the right person to play the role. He’s a terrific father.  Why did you choose a Dylan Thomas poem to use in the film?  C: Those lines at the end—“Do not go gentle into that good night… Rage, rage against the dying of the light”—I have [not] heard a better way of expressing the sentiment of death, dying, the end of the world, any of those things. There’s such a raw emotion in those words; they speak to me so strongly. I didn’t want to write my own version of that. Another example, which I didn’t use, would be of TS Elliot saying, “This is the way the world ends/Not with a bang but a whimper.”  (E-mail the columnist at rvnepales_5585@yahoo.com.

"Since the #MYCALVINS campaign kicked off last year, it has seen a rollout of some of music and fashion’s brightest stars take centre stage. The first instalment of the campaign saw Solange, Kelela and Dev Hynes model both denim and underwear into one whilst the second instalment saw A$AP Rocky and his A$AP Mob swag their way through a barn in the famous jeans. The most recent edition saw supermodel Cindy Crawford’s children Kaia and Presley Gerber show us what it means to be family – the main focus of the campaign.  When it comes to famous families there probably isn’t one that stands out more than the Kardashians (even if it is just because you love to hate them), making them the perfect choice to front the latest set of images. Fronted by the Kardashian and Jenner sisters (Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, Kendall and Kylie if you needed reminding), it sees them in white underwear lounging on a giant blanket from the SS18 show.  Elsewhere, Kim wears a Canadian Tux (double denim if you’re not familiar) and Kylie sports a matching black and white set from the runway show. Although Khloe and Kourtney have not been the faces of any high fashion campaigns before, Kim starred in Balmain’s AW16 campaign alongside husband Kanye. Kylie and Kendall also fronted the AW15 season for the Parisian house. Not to mention Marc Jacobs, Fendi, Givenchy under Kendall’s belt too.  The campaign drops at a time where rumours are circling as to whether Kylie is pregnant or not. Eagle-eyed fans will note that she is pictured artfully covering her stomach with a CK blanket. Conspiracy?! No doubt Kris’s plan for the family (and new baby – hi Chicago!) will be unveiled soon. Meanwhile, the campaign will continue to run throughout the season. Keep an eye out for who will front it next."
"Chrissy Teigen doesn’t mind calling out her husband for the whole world to see.  The supermodel took to Twitter to roast John Legend for stealing all ― yes, all ― of her phone chargers.  “Yes @johnlegend I buy and leave all the phone chargers all around the house just so you can unplug them all and take them to work with you. all of them!” Teigen wrote on Wednesday, her words dripping with sarcasm. “I love that you love chargers! they’re all for you! I just love you that’s why I buy them. because you love them!”  The “Lip Sync Battle” commentator tweeted then that she was going to purchase a unicorn charger so Legend might avoid taking it:  @johnlegend take this one u thief — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 8, 2018  As one Twitter user put it, the two are facing a “power struggle.”  It sounds like the two of you are facing a bit of a... power struggle.    I'll show myself out. — Jon S. (@SleepiestNinja) February 8, 2018  But clearly, the charger-stealing scenario hit a nerve with people in relationships.  “Orange Is the New Black” star Ruby Rose tweeted at her girlfriend, Jessica Veronica of The Veronicas, and called her out for doing the same thing as Legend:  @Jessicaveronica lol .. You. You are why I need 50000 chargers on my rider. — Ruby Rose (@RubyRose) February 8, 2018  Many others shared their power struggles:  This is marriage summed up in one tweet. — Katie👸🏼 (@katiemylady__) February 8, 2018  I’m married to the same kind of person. Who knew so many men loved chargers this way. Nothing makes my day like frantically looking for a charger when I’m on 2%. And he has them all. Every single one for one phone. — lynnethedreamer (@lynne816) February 8, 2018  pretty sure this is a universal husband/ wife struggle. 😂😂 — Pamela Phillips (@pameladphillips) February 8, 2018  This battle over wall chargers is so relatable lol https://t.co/gq17fYoPES — KristinLasVegas (@KristinLasVegas) February 8, 2018  Teigen has never shied away from calling out Legend on social media. When the musician posted a beautiful ― but low-quality ― photo on Instagram for his wife’s birthday, Teigen simply commented “How about a hi-res,” a reference to the blurriness of the picture.  They also use outlets like Twitter to help each other, like the time Teigen seemingly couldn’t find one of the couple’s toilets (yes, really). Luckily, Legend knew what happened and tweeted an explanation.  And despite all the charger-stealing and blurry pictures, Teigen told Us Weekly in a 2016 interview why she won’t ever leave Legend."

"After several weeks of fun, heartfelt performances, Sasha Pieterse's Dancing With the Stars journey has come to an end, and the actress admits that she's sad to say goodbye.  Pieterse and her pro partner, Gleb Savchenko, were eliminated at the end of DWTS's Disney Night on Monday, and the pair spoke with ET's Keltie Knight after the show.  ""I'm not mad, I'm just really bummed. I really wanted to be here,"" the Pretty Little Liars star shared. ""It sucks, but I made some amazing friends, I had such a good time, and I feel like I'm just grateful.""  One thing she's particularly grateful for is Savchenko, whom she's become fast friends with over the course of the season. They're so tight, in fact, that Pieterse's pro partner is going to give a few lessons to her fiance, Hudson Sheaffer.  ""[Gleb] can't get away from me that easy, he's going to teach my fiancé how to dance,"" she said, smiling.  WATCH: Sasha Pieterse Channels 'The Little Mermaid' on 'DWTS's Disney Night, Reveals She's Lost 37 Pounds  Going into Monday night, Pieterse and Savchenko were tied with five other couples for fourth place, having earned a score of 24 out of 30 for their foxtrot during the show's Most Memorable Year night last week.  So, while they weren't near the top of the leader board, they had been in past weeks and they weren't really on anyone's list of stars who were expected to go home tonight. (The same goes for Frankie Muniz and Witney Carson, who were one of the other couples to earn a 24 last week and also found themselves in jeopardy during Monday's elimination.)  PHOTOS: The Complete List: 'Dancing with the Stars' Winners  Savchenko admits that the elimination was just as much a shock to him as anyone. ""I never thought it would happen. I thought we have another couple of weeks at least,"" he said. ""But it's a dance competition, someone's gotta go and unfortunately it's us.""  ""I'm so proud of my partner,"" he added. ""She came so far, she did such a good job tonight. You've shown such a huge improvement and as a teacher, I'm really, really proud of you.""  Throughout the season, Pieterse, 21, got candid with Savchecko and her fans about her battle with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, a hormone imbalance that led to her gaining nearly 70 pounds in around two years. On Monday, she revealed that, since joining the show, she'd managed to lose 37 pounds and previously said that the show has helped her to start ""feeling like me again.""  WATCH: 'DWTS': Jordan Fisher & Lindsay Arnold Earn Perfect 10s for 'Moana' Foxtrot on Disney Night  So for Pieterse, this season has meant more to her than just a chance to improve her dance skills -- it's given her the opportunity to change her life.  ""It really has been an incredible experience and you can't really describe it unless you're doing it. It's been amazing for my soul, for me just getting back to who I am, [and] obviously for my body and my health,"" she shared. ""I'm just really glad that I was able to have the platform to talk about my situation and I had so much fun.""

"Steven Bochco, a producer whose boundary-pushing series such as “Hill Street Blues” and “NYPD Blue” helped define the modern TV drama, has died. He was 74.  Bochco had been battling a rare form of leukemia for several years. He had a transplant in late 2014 that was credited with prolonging his life. A family spokesman told the Associated Press that he died in his sleep on Sunday after a battle with cancer, but did not release details of a memorial service.  Working with different collaborators, Bochco co-created some of TV’s most popular series for more than 20 years while helping to create the template for modern hourlongs featuring large ensemble casts, serialized storylines and edgy content.  The recipient of numerous industry awards, including the Humanitas Prize and Peabody honors, Bochco was nominated for an Emmy 30 times in his capacities as producer and writer, winning 10.  On “NYPD Blue,” he consciously set out to expand the parameters of what was acceptable on broadcast television, and he recalled sitting with then-ABC Entertainment chief Robert Iger — who went on to become CEO of the Walt Disney Co. — drawing naked figures, determining exactly how much of the body could be shown.  Related 'NYPD Blue' Follow-Up Series Lands Pilot Production Commitment at ABC 'NYPD Blue' at 25: Dennis Franz, Amy Brenneman, Gordon Clapp Reflect on Legacy  Bochco launched such series as “Hill Street Blues” — a ground-breaking, Emmy-winning cop show — and “L.A. Law” for NBC before entering into a landmark 10-series deal with ABC in the late 1980s. The relationship produced some clear hits (“NYPD Blue,” “Doogie Howser, M.D.”) and notable failures, including the musical police drama “Cop Rock” and the serialized courtroom drama “Murder One,” which followed a single murder trial over an entire season. As virtual proof the latter was ahead of its time, Bochco essentially revived it in 2014, under the title “Murder in the First,” for TNT, where it ran for three years.  Asked how he could risk gambling on a musical like “Cop Rock” given the richness of his ABC pact, Bochco once joked, “With my deal, how could I not?”  Bochco wasn’t above engaging in public spats and power struggles, from complaining about his treatment by network executives to tussling with recalcitrant stars. In one of the highest-profile tiffs, his rift with David Caruso during the first season of “NYPD Blue” led to the actor’s exit, a considerable gamble for a series in its first season. Bochco replaced him with former “L.A. Law” co-star Jimmy Smits, and the program went on to run for 11 years.  Although Bochco often consciously pressed against boundaries and seemed to delight in testing censors, he recalled that the breakthrough storytelling style of “Hill Street” was born more out of necessity than design.  “We had so many characters that we realized we couldn’t service 10 or 11 characters within the confines of a single episode, so the only way that we could really do justice to the size of the world was by creating storylines that spilled over the margins,” he told the New York Times.  The producer also had a way of celebrating even his failures. When “Cop Rock” came to an end after a mere 11 episodes, what turned out to be the final episode incorporated a musical sequence where a fat lady literally sang, signaling its cancellation.  Bochco also appeared to relish nettling his critics, saying that the pressure campaign waged against “NYPD Blue” – which helped prompt dozens of stations not to air the show when it premiered – ultimately helped promote the series and turned it into a hit.  Steven Ronald Bochco was born in New York, the son of a violin virtuoso (which inspired his production company’s onscreen logo). He attended NYU and subsequently Carnegie Institute of Technology, receiving a degree in theater.  He started his writing career in the 1960s. Credits included “Columbo,” with an episode directed by Steven Spielberg, who also came up through the ranks at Universal Television.  Bochco wrote such features as “The Movie Maker” and “Silent Running” before he began to steadfastly focus on television and create his own shows, including “Delvecchio,” a drama starring Judd Hirsch. Later came “Bay City Blues,” about a baseball team, which didn’t last.  With “Hill Street Blues,” Bochco and co-creator Michael Kozoll broke the dramatic mold, featuring a huge ensemble cast and gritty narrative while juggling various subplots. NBC was in the ratings cellar at the time, but its patience with prestige programs like “Hill Street” and “Cheers” was rewarded after “The Cosby Show” premiered in 1984, turning its Thursday lineup into a ratings juggernaut.  Beyond his own career, Bochco helped shepherd along those of several other prominent writers, hiring David Milch on “Hill Street” and enlisting David E. Kelley — then a Boston lawyer — to work on “L.A. Law.”  When the Producers Guild of America honored Bochco with its David Susskind lifetime achievement award in 1999, his track record of quality programs was cited as “the standard all television producers strive for.”  For all of his success with police dramas and legal shows, Bochco produced a wide variety of series, from the animated satire “Capitol Critters” to “Public Morals,” an edgy comedy on which he collaborated with Jay Tarses that also ran into standards-and-practices problems.  Although major successes eluded him in his later years, Bochco remained active and in demand, taking over as showrunner of “Commander in Chief” — an ABC drama that featured Geena Davis as the first female U.S. president — and co-creating “Over There,” an FX series that focused on soldiers in Iraq and their families back home. The latter, introduced while the war was ongoing in 2005, engendered controversy because of the timing and subject matter.  Bochco also produced the legal drama “Raising the Bar” for TNT that ran two seasons in 2008 and 2009.  The producer also tried his hand at novels, writing “Death by Hollywood,” a darkly comic satire with a struggling screenwriter as its protagonist. His struggle with leukemia prompted him to write his autobiography, “Truth is a Total Defense: My Fifty Years in Television,” which he self-published in 2016.  Bochco was loyal to his friends — certain actors appeared in his shows time and again — but could also nurse a grudge. He also became disenchanted with what he saw as creative interference from the networks, hewing more toward cable.  Bochco’s association with the business extended to his family. His second wife, Barbara Bosson, co-starred in “Hill Street Blues,” and his sister, Joanna Frank, had a recurring role on “L.A. Law” as the wife of firm partner Douglas Brackman, played by her real-life husband (and thus Bochco’s brother-in-law), Alan Rachins. The producer later married Dayna Kalins, a TV executive. His son, Jesse, became a prominent director, working on many of his father’s shows.  Bochco was thrice married, the first time to Gabrielle Levin, the second to Bosson.  He is survived by his third wife Dayna Kalins, whom he married in 2000, as well children Melissa Bochco, Jesse Bochco and Sean Flanagan, and two grandchildren."

"Caitlyn Jenner has spoken out about Rob Kardashian’s social media rampage, in which he posted naked photos of ex-fiancée Blac Chyna.  The I Am Cait alum, 67, weighed in on the situation while appearing on The View on Friday, July 14, along with revenge porn victim Mischa Barton and her lawyer Lisa Bloom, who is also representing Chyna. “It’s a tough deal. We’ve had to deal with this, obviously in our family,” Jenner said. “Rob was stupid for doing that. He kind of apologized.”  Jenner clarified that he has not had much of a relationship with Kardashian, 30, in recent years, though. “I’ve never met Blac Chyna, never met the kid [Dream Kardashian]. Rob, I haven’t really haven’t had a serious conversation with in years,” she said. “I’ve kind of been out of that scene, so I really can’t comment on what’s going on there.” (The rest of the Kardashians have also distanced themselves from Jenner after the former Olympian made damaging claims in her memoir about ex-wife Kris Jenner.)  When asked by the View cohosts if she was surprised by Kardashian’s actions, the former decathlete replied, “Guys — I know because I used to be over on that team — can be really stupid and do stupid things. I’ve tried to warn my kids — all of them, I’ve got a lot of kids — you’ve got to pick your friends, and it’s hard to do. You can be tremendously deceived, and it’s not your fault, but you have to pick your friends wisely.”  The Arthur George sock designer could be facing legal trouble after he went on an explosive social media tirade on July 5, in which he claimed the 29-year-old model cheated on him and that he paid for her bills, cars, jewelry and weight-loss surgeries. He also posted several nude photos of Chyna on Instagram and Twitter.  The Lashed Cosmetics founder obtained a temporary restraining order against him on Monday, July 10. That same week, a source told Us Weekly that the exes “haven’t spoken” since the social media war. As long as Rob obeys the order of protection, Chyna won’t pursue a criminal investigation, Bloom told Entertainment Tonight. “For now, Chyna has said she does not want to go to the police or pursue the criminal route,” Bloom told the outlet.  If Chyna changes her mind, however, sexual privacy attorney and expert Carrie Goldberg told Us that Kardashian could face major consequences for sharing naked photos without his ex’s consent. “It is a misdemeanor and it is punishable by up to six months in jail and then also a fine,” Goldberg told Us, adding that Chyna could also sue her former Rob & Chyna costar for financial damages.  Since the incident, Kardashian has apologized. His actions “were a spontaneous reaction that he regrets,” his attorney Robert Shapiro told TMZ on Monday. “Rob’s only concern is for the well-being of baby Dream.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

"Scott Wilson, a star of The Walking Dead, In Cold Blood and many others, died at his home in Los Angeles on Saturday due to complications from leukemia. He was 76.  Wilson’s rep Dominic Mancini confirmed the news to PEOPLE Saturday evening. “Scott was one of the most genuine, inspirational, and truly beloved people,” Mancini said. “His amazing legacy will live on through his timeless performances. He will be missed deeply by his wife, family, and friends.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Scott will always be remembered as a great actor and we all feel fortunate to have known him as an even better person,” AMC said in a statement. “The character he embodied on The Walking Dead, Hershel, lived at the emotional core of the show. Like Scott in our lives, Hershel was a character whose actions continue to inform our characters’ choices to this day. Our hearts go out to his wife, family, friends and to the millions of fans who loved him. Scott will be missed.”  The news of Wilson’s death came within hours of the New York Comic-Con announcement that he would be reprising his role as Hershel Greene during the first half of The Walking Dead‘s ninth season, which kicks off this Sunday. It will be one of his final onscreen performances.  Wilson is survived by his wife, Heavenly, whom he married in 1977.  Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for AMC  Wilson had a long career before appearing as Herschel Greene during the second season of The Walking Dead and becoming one of the show’s most beloved characters to date.  Born in Georgia in 1942, Wilson made his onscreen debut in 1967’s In the Heat of the Night and followed it up later that year with the role of real-life murderer Dick Hickock in an adaptation of Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood. He played George Wilson opposite Robert Redford in 1974’s The Great Gatsby and earned a Golden Globe nomination in 1980 for his turn in The Ninth Configuration.  Wilson also made memorable recurring appearances on CSI as Sam Braun, the father of Marg Helgenberger’s Catherine Willows, and followed his time on The Walking Dead with roles on Bosch and The OA.  A number of Wilson’s costars shared their thoughts and memories of him following the news of his death Saturday evening.  “The first time I met Scott Wilson, he gave me a big hug and said that this thing I had become apart of… was a family,” wrote TWD‘s Khary Payton on Twitter. “He said I had a responsibility to take care of it. I have tried very hard to do that, sir. & I will continue. I promise. See you on the other side, my friend.”  “Scott Wilson has departed. I am heartbroken. We are fewer. Go easy into the light brother,” wrote Bosch‘s Titus Welliver.  “I just heard the news about the passing of #ScottWilson,” Yvette Nicole Brown said on Twitter. “He was a wonderful man and I am heartbroken. #RIP #Hershel #TWD”  “Scott Wilson was simply the finest actor and more importantly the finest and most decent man I ever knew. A Noble actor and my dear friend,” wrote Rob Schneider. “Scott Wilson had the best lady to share his life, Heavenly Wilson.

"Third generation Greek immigrant John Stamos has long been a proud American, and now that he’s also become a proud papa for the first time, he’ll be sharing his patriotism with his new son, Billy.  Stamos, 54, will be bringing nearly 2-month-old Billy along on his first cross-country trip as the Fuller House star/producer returns to host PBS’s annual broadcast of A Capitol Fourth, the national 4th of July celebration in Washington, D.C.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  It’s been a celebratory year thus far for Stamos, who wed model/actress Caitlin McHugh in February and welcomed their new baby – named after his late father – in April. But the timing of the new arrival made Stamos wonder if he’d be able to return to host the 38th annual 4th of July broadcast from the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol again this year after deeply enjoying his debut stint in 2017.  John Stamosand Caitlin McHugh Rachel Murray/Getty  “Fortunately, I’ve been able to take off work now, but I said, ‘Well I don’t know if I could do [the concert] again, because I’m having a little baby,’ ” Stamos told PEOPLE at a photo shoot to promote the celebration. “And they said, ‘Well, what can we do to get you?’ “  The solution? Family road trip! “I said, ‘Well, I got to bring the kid, then.’ So we’re bringing Billy! And PBS just sent this really cute onesie that says ‘Future Host,’ and all this patriotic stuff.”  It’ll be baby Stamos’ first cross-country excursion, coming on the heels of a slightly not-so-smooth local road trip, Stamos admitted. “It was Mother’s Day and Caitlin’s birthday, so we went down to Laguna [Beach], and it was the first time we didn’t have a nanny — that was rough!” he laughed. “[But] so far, it’s been a dream, and when I look at him, I feel like I’ve been thinking about that face for a long time.”  Stamos said that fatherhood has been everything that he expected it would be, and it’s deepened his connection to his country. “I always knew it was going to be like this,” he explained. “It took me longer than it should’ve, but I knew that I would be a family and be contributing to this country, and holding onto the morals and the values that my parents had, that I like to think of the world having. It’s a time to be kind and graceful to people. It just takes so much energy to block all the negativity. I’m really trying to get people together.”  As a bonus, Stamos’ longtime friends and frequent, if unofficial, bandmates — the iconic, multi-platinum selling music legends The Beach Boys — will join him in the nation’s capitol as both performers and the recipients of the fifth annual A CAPITOL FOURTH’s National Artistic Achievement Award, with Stamos presenting.  “I’m just the biggest glorified fan, really,” Stamos said of his connection to the group, which goes back to the 1980s, appearing in their music video for “Kokomo,” frequently joining them on stage behind the drum kit and executive producing the 2000 miniseries The Beach Boys: An American Family. “I’m a fan who gets to hang out with them.”  RELATED VIDEO: New Dad John Stamos Opens Up About Fatherhood & Reveals Which Parent His Son Looks Like  So much so that the band has become as close as family: founding member Mike Love even got ordained and officiated Stamos and McHugh’s wedding ceremony.

It’s always a special feeling playing with them, but especially when you’re in D.C. I think I said it even in the show last year: the Fourth of July, Washington, the Beach Boys — it doesn’t get more American than that. But more than that, I love the effect they have on people and that their music has on people. In a graceless time right now, where people are looking for comfort, I think the Beach Boys music and this whole show, it does that, right?”  An all-star roster of performers bridging a variety of American favorite musical genres will be joining Stamos and the Beach Boys for the celebration, including Jimmy Buffett and the Broadway cast of the new musical Escape From Margaritaville (this is their first stop after Broadway before launching a national tour); three-time Grammy Award-winning a capella artists Pentatonix; legendary Motown stars The Temptations; platinum country music singer-songwriter Luke Combs; country music star and American Idol alum Lauren Alaina; gospel legend CeCe Winans; and internationally-acclaimed violinist Joshua Bell; with the National Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of top pops conductor Jack Everly.  Additionally, soprano superstar Renée Fleming will perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” to honor the nation’s men and women in uniform and their families.  Also participating in the event will be the Choral Arts Society of Washington, the U.S. Army Herald Trumpets, the U.S. Army Ceremonial Band, Members of the Armed Forces carrying the State and Territorial Flags and the Armed Forces Color Guard provided by the Military District of Washington, D.C. The top-rated, award-winning program will be capped off with a rousing rendition of Tchaikovsky’s “1812 Overture” complete with live cannon fire provided by the United States Army Presidential Salute Battery, an audience favorite and “A Capitol Fourth” tradition.  Caitlyn McHugh and son Billy John Stamos/Instagram  The celebration will culminate with the largest and most spectacular fireworks display in the nation.  “It was electrifying,” said Stamos of his debut hosting stint. “And I’ve been in front of crowds and a lot of the shows or concerts, and Broadway stuff I’ve done. But they’re coming there for a different reason, to see something. Here I felt they were part of it. They were part of our party, part of our show. … I’ll try again this year to interact with the crowd. I let the producer and the director know, ‘I may stop and talk to somebody,’ and we did it. It was really sweet.”  Stamos was also gratified that last year during the show he was able to address the hot-button topic of immigration, a facet of American tradition he values given his own family’s history since his grandfather passed through Ellis Island to embrace the nation’s traditions of liberty, opportunity and freedom of speech.  “The beauty was that this country give him that, and then has given that to my father and me, and I’ll pass that on to my son, all because of an immigrant coming over,” said Stamos. “He worked hard and took advantage, in the best sense, of what this country has to offer all of us.”  The 38th annual broadcast of A Capitol Fourth airs on PBS Wednesday, July 4 from 8-9:30 p.m. ET before a concert audience of hundreds of thousands, millions more at home, as well as to our troops serving around the world on the American Forces Network. The program can also be heard live in stereo over NPR member stations nationwide. The concert will also be live-streamed on PBS, You Tube, Facebook and www.pbs.org/a-capitol-fourth and available as Video on Demand for a limited time only, July 4 to July 18, 2018."

"Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara 'found love' while shooting biblical epic - report BelfastTelegraph.co.uk Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara have long been friends, but are said to have ""found love"" while shooting Mary Magdalene in Italy last year (16). https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/joaquin-phoenix-and-rooney-mara-found-love-while-shooting-biblical-epic-report-35359969.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/article35359968.ece/08b80/AUTOCROP/h342/cover_media_cmg95c39be0-84b3-485c-9ac4-66db72a2befb_0  Email  Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara have long been friends, but are said to have ""found love"" while shooting Mary Magdalene in Italy last year (16).  Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara's friendship reportedly turned into romance when they were shooting upcoming film Mary Magdalene.  The pair have long been close friends but it was while filming the biblical epic, in which Rooney plays the title character and Joaquin stars as Jesus Christ, in Italy last year (16) that they are said to have ""found love"".  A source told the New York Post's gossip column Page Six that the new relationship is the reason neither star attended the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday (08Jan17), where Rooney's movie Lion was up for four gongs.  “They were holed up together in the desert (instead),” the insider added.  While images emerged of Joaquin and Rooney shooting Mary Magdalene, they were also seen spending time together off set, including sharing cigarettes on the balcony of a room at their hotel in Matera, southern Italy, last November (16).  The claims surrounding Rooney's new romance comes after reports she has split from director Charlie McDowell after six years together. Both Rooney and Charlie's representatives had no comment when contacted by Page Six, and the pair have not been photographed together since August (16).  Despite Page Six's report, Joaquin's representative has denied the actor and Rooney are anything apart from ""good friends"".  “They worked on (2013 film) Her, Mary Magdalene and their next movie (Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot, due for release in 2018),” his rep said. “They are and have been good friends for quite a long time.”  Joaquin has previously been romantically linked to actresses Liv Tyler and Anna Paquin, and DJ Allie Teilz. He hit headlines in 2014 when he announced he was engaged to a yoga instructor who had helped him ""harness his hog"", but it was later revealed to be an unusual joke.  © Cover Media  Belfast Telegraph Digital"
"The Second Amendment has continuously been under assault in the United States and in the United Nations. Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.The United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it sounds like representatives of the United States promised “full implementation” of the UN’s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Perhaps most interestingly of all, the mainstream media has been entirely silent on the issue… perhaps they don’t want to laud this win and stir up patriots?The Third Review Conference for the UN’s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American ‘representatives’ at the conference agreed to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce “proper management” of “small arms and light weapons” stockpiles.It seems that this agreement also includes ‘stockpiles’ owned by American citizens.The United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name, is hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.The conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.This will serve as a means for the United Nations to find ‘illicit’ ammunition and firearms.Of course, given the UN’s history of pushing for gun control measures, it’s not beyond the pale to believe that the organization would declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or that home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale is illegal.If the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN’s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.However, it gets worse still. The ‘Programme of Action’ also allows UN ‘peacekeepers’ to go to member nations to ‘assist’ in meeting the goals of the program.So, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to ‘help’ speed the process up.The conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.Firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).Secondly, they agreed to strengthen ‘coordinated approaches’ nationally for implementing the PoA.Thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.Fourth, the representatives agreed to create a ‘national point of contact’ to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.Fifth, they promised to ‘make better use’ of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be ‘in compliance’ with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and ‘non-proliferation,’ which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.Finally, they agreed to ‘significantly reduce’ illicit flows of small arms through means such as ‘voluntary surrender’ programmes and ‘illicit weapons’ recovery.In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, then the UN will decide if it wants to send armed peacekeepers to the nation or not.This agreement is wildly unconstitutional, and that’s being kind. It violates the Second Amendment, obviously, by its very nature, but it goes further than that.By requiring that state governments, county governments, and local governments bend to the wills of the federal government (and international government), it violates the Tenth Amendment, which states that powers not given to the federal government in the constitution are “reserved to the states respectively.”The idea of a ‘liaison’ between the federal government and the UN is also legally questionable.Apparently, the United States’ representative(s) don’t see a problem with this kind of unconstitutional nonsense.Perhaps it’s time that Donald Trump remove the United States from the United Nations, an organization that does little more than take money from America and hands it to corrupt nations via poorly-run bureaucracies.Perhaps, before the UN lectures America and other nations for recognizing the rights of their citizens to keep and bear arms, it should look at its own failures to stop the ‘illicit firearms trade.’UN Peacekeeper operations are infamous for leaving behind firearms, particularly in the third world. There’s a reason that, among the millions of Ak-pattern rifles in Africa, there are also hundreds of thousands of G3’s and CETME rifles from European militaries; the UN leaves them behind when they deploy.If the UN pushes the issue, they’ll likely find that the United States is not so quick to acquiesce as third-world nations who constantly have their hands out for ‘free’ stuff. If they’re going to attempt to undermine the laws of a nation, perhaps they should no longer operate out of the nation with legal immunity."
"Of all the couples that walked the Oscars red carpet together on Sunday night, it’s likely none had the same symbolic significance as Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino. The actresses were among the earliest to come forward with their stories of being sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein, bringing into stark relief the impact Weinstein had on their careers and on Hollywood at large. Sorvino, who won an Oscar in 1996 for the Weinstein-released Mighty Aphrodite, told The New Yorker she believed that, by turning down Weinstein’s advances, he had actively discouraged other filmmakers from working with her. Judd, who spoke to The New York Times for the first blockbuster story about Weinstein, said at the time, “Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it’s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.” (Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.)  In December, Peter Jackson told New Zealand’s Stuff that executives at Miramax told him about both Judd and Sorvino, “they were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid them at all costs. This was probably in 1998. At the time, we had no reason to question what these guys were telling us—but in hindsight, I realize that this was very likely the Miramax smear campaign in full swing. I now suspect we were fed false information about both of these talented women—and as a direct result their names were removed from our casting list.”  Sorvino tweeted an emotional response to Jackson’s revelation:  Speaking to Vanity Fair’s Krista Smith on the red carpet, Judd and Sorvino spoke about the goals of the Time‘s Up movement: “I want people to know that this movement isn’t stopping, we’re going forward until we have an equitable and safe world for women,“ Sorvino said:  During the ceremony, Judd will present an award alongside two other women who have accused Weinstein: Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek. As Rebecca Keegan reported from the Oscars rehearsals, Sciorra—who claimed to The New Yorker that Weinstein raped her, and that her career suffered as a result—seemed visibly overwhelmed to be onstage.  Though the Time’s Up movement, which announced its presence forcefully with pins and an all-black dress code at the Golden Globes, announced it planned to look beyond the red carpet in its activism, Judd and Sorvino’s united presence was a reminder of how striking, and symbolic, a red carpet appearance can be.

"Travis Scott has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after being arrested during a concert in Arkansas in May 2017 on charges including inciting a riot, Us Weekly confirms.  The 25-year-old rapper’s attorney Jon Nelson tells Us that his client’s case was quietly resolved in January through plea negotiations. Scott (real name Jacques Webster) pleaded guilty to the lowest charge and was required to pay $640 in court-associated costs, in addition to $6,825.31 to two people who said they were injured at the concert. The other two misdemeanor charges — inciting a riot and endangering the welfare of a child — were dismissed.  “Obviously, [Scott] would not in any way want a riot to break out at his concert. That would not be good for him as an entertainer,” Nelson says. “To think that he incited one is ridiculous. We think the police way overcharged him. The prosecutor’s office finally did the right thing — they made an offer that he agreed to. … If anyone was hurt, Travis expressed concern from the beginning. He wanted to make sure those people were taken care of.”  The attorney added that he believes the disorderly conduct charge could eventually be expunged from Scott’s record.  The Rogers Police Department told Us at the time of the arrest that the “Goosebumps” rapper “encouraged people to rush the stage and bypass the security protocols to ensure concertgoer safety.” He was taken into custody at the Benton County Jail and released later in the evening.  The news of Scott’s guilty plea comes just a few days after he became a father with girlfriend Kylie Jenner, who gave birth to the couple’s daughter, Stormi, on Thursday, February 1. A source exclusively told Us that the 20-year-old reality star is “loving starting a family” with Scott, whom she began dating in April 2017.

"Two years into a relationship with her boyfriend, actress Vanessa Kirby was shocked to wake up one day and find out she was married to Tom Cruise.  While filming “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” with 56-year-old Cruise last spring, paparazzi caught the co-stars kissing on set and the tabloids went wild.  “Even though the [film] crew were there, it was all [in the tabloids] like, ‘The next wife falls at his feet,'” Kirby, 30, told Marie Claire UK in a new interview. “The most disconcerting thing was the people I didn’t think would believe it, did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, ‘Are you OK?’ I don’t think they believe anything they read now because you just can’t.  “None of it is real,” Kirby added. “To be getting married to him? Not even a snog, it was marriage.”  “The Crown” actress has been dating actor Callum Turner for two years and plans to keep that part of her life private.  “I’ve been lucky because I barely get recognized, and I keep my relationship super private,” Kirby shared. “[Turner is] just completely wonderful and he’s my best friend, so that’s … I guess you can either choose to talk about it or not.”  She added, “If you talk about it, it becomes interesting to people, but if you don’t, then it’s not.”"
"We’ve got people in charge of important shit who don’t believe in science, the actor said Thursday night in Los Angeles.  Harrison Ford got political on Thursday night at 3Labs in Culver City when he was honored by Conservation International, a nonprofit environmental group he has been involved with for 26 years.  ""We face an unprecedented moment in this country. Today's greatest threat is not climate change, not pollution, not flood or fire,"" Ford said during his acceptance speech of the Founders' Award. ""It's that we've got people in charge of important shit who don't believe in science.""  He went on to criticize those politicians who let ""political or economic self-interest denigrate or belittle sound scientific understanding of the causes and effects of human pressure on the environment.""  Ford serves as executive vice chair of Conservation International, which celebrated its 30th anniversary at the event. The group aims to protect nature and specifically focused on a 'No Forests, No Future' theme at the gala, highlighting the Amazon rainforest and its importance in addressing climate change.  ""I'm here tonight for one reason: I care deeply for the natural world. It's not about me, it's not about me at all, it's about this other world we're going to leave behind,"" the actor said. ""If we don't stop the destruction of nature, nothing else will matter. Jobs won't matter, our economies won't matter, our freedoms and ethics won't matter, our children's education and potential won't matter, peace, prosperity. If we end the ability of a healthy natural world to sustain humanity nothing else will matter, simply said.""  Ford has been deeply involved in the environmental cause for several decades, meeting with lawmakers, businesses and communities to discuss how to improve conservation policy and practices.  ""Other than my family, doing this work has been the most important thing of my life,"" he said. ""Nature doesn't need people, people need nature.""  Music festival Rock in Rio and SC Johnson were also honored at the event, which drew Calista Flockhart, Sophia Bush and Arielle Kebbel, with a performance by Vanessa Carlton. Conservation International showed its virtual reality film Under the Canopy as well, giving guests a real-life look into the Amazon.  ""If you protect tropical forests, if you end tropical forest deforestation, it would be the equivalent of basically taking every car in the planet and making it into a Tesla overnight, that's how important it is. The epicenter of that is the Amazon,"" said M. Sanjayan, the group's CEO and an environmental news analyst.  Conservation International launched the largest tropical forest restoration project in the world this year as a result, and Ford will have continued involvement in these worldwide environmental projects.  ""We're not going to depend on governments alone, we'll help equip communities and businesses to lead,"" he said. ""It's a long road but I have hope."""
"Engraged over new co-host Ryan Seacrest‘s brazen bid to move Live to Los Angeles, daytime diva Kelly Ripa has told bosses, “I’m done!”  RadarOnline.com has learned the popular chatfest is in chaos after Ripa, 46, told network honchos she’s fed up watching them kiss up to Seacrest — and she’s not going to take it anymore!  “Kelly’s announced that if push comes to shove, she’s ready to walk,” said an insider close to the syndicated show.  PHOTOS: Kelly Ripa’s 8 Most Shocking Secrets & Scandals Exposed  “Kelly’s given them an ultimatum — it’s her way or the highway!” continued the insider. “She feels that she was stabbed in the back over the whole Michael Strahan fiasco, and she’s not going to allow it to happen again!”  According to sources, Ripa exploded when Seacrest pushed for Live with Kelly and Ryan to be moved permanently to Los Angeles to suit his schedule — after ABC announced he’ll return as host of the rebooted American Idol next year.  That meant Seacrest, 42, would have to be in L.A. on Sunday nights to film Idol, then board a red-eye flight to New York to be on set for Live on Monday morning and host his radio show.  PHOTOS: Truce! Kelly Ripa & Michael Strahan’s On-Air Feud Is Finally Over  Apparently that was too daunting for Seacrest — and he pushed for the L.A. move.  “After Ryan made his demand, network brass wanted Kelly to uproot her family and move to California,” tattled a source close to Seacrest. “That’s when Kelly put her foot down and said, ‘No way!'”  “Kelly pointed out that her production company with husband Mark Consuelos, Milojo, is based in New York and so is Live,” said the source.  PHOTOS: Kelly Ripa Spotted For The First Time Since Ditching Michael Strahan On ‘Live’  “She also pointed out that her son, Joaquin, is about to begin high school in New York City. Producers have offered to have Joaquin home-schooled or provide a tutor for him, but she won’t pull him out of school.”  Producers are trying to convince Ripa to get on board — even if it’s just during the period when Idol goes live, the source said.  Besides that, ratings have been tanking since Seacrest signed on, and “bosses are telling Kelly [the move] will help the ratings because they’ll have access to all the stars in Hollywood,” spilled the source.

Inside ‘Selfish’ Michael Strahan’s Biggest Scandals  “But Kelly feels once again the show that bears her name is being hijacked from her — which is what happened with Michael Strahan!”  Since Live launched in 1983, it’s always been filmed in New York City — although the hosts have changed, with Regis Philbin, Kathie Lee Gifford, Strahan and guest hosts playing musical chairs.

When she was angry with ABC for favoring Michael, she refused to come to work for a week. Now that ABC is treating Ryan like royalty, Kelly could be gone for good. She’s very emotional and thinks with her heart, not her head. Kelly needs to think she’s the top priority.”  We pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?

"Ellen DeGeneres is desperate to save her marriage to Portia de Rossi. That’s why Ellen’s been urging her to attend counseling sessions with her, according to a new report. They’ve hit a rough patch in their relationship and apparently Ellen wants them to get back on track before they head towards a divorce.  Things have gotten so bad between Ellen and Portia that they’ve been fighting non-stop, both at home and in public. In fact, one insider said that Ellen and Portia often get into heated arguments on the set of her daytime talk show. To make matters worse, Ellen hates it when other people gossip about her personal problems. That’s why she’s been pushing Portia to attend counseling sessions with her as one last effort to save their crumbling marriage.  One source close to the situation told Life & Style Weekly, “Ellen has been in counseling, both solo and with Portia. Part of their therapy is to go on more date nights. That’s why they’ve been seen out and more together lately. It’s all about spending quality time together, but still giving each other space during the workday.”  Yet, the last time Ellen and Portia were spotted together was back on February 25th during a pre-Oscars party in Los Angeles. Since then, Portia has been keeping her distance from Ellen, or at least in public. One of the reasons why Portia is looking for a way out is because she’s tired of having to constantly listen to Ellen and her demands. Previous reports even indicated that Portia was fed up with Ellen’s controlling behavior. Insiders say that Portia is fed up with Ellen calling all the shots at home. She feels like she lives in a golden cage with Ellen. If that weren’t enough, Ellen likes to have the last say, especially when it comes to her career, personal and even day-to-day choices.  Of course, time will only tell if Ellen and Portia’s counseling will save their marriage. Tell us, do you think Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi are having marital issues? Could that be the reason why they haven’t been spotted in public together for several weeks now? Ellen herself has not made any comments about her personal life.

"Jennifer Aniston doesn't need your consolation, advice or Brad Pitt to validate her existence  ""I just want Jen to be happy *bursts into tears*""  ""But she's Rachael!! She has to find love!!""  ""I keep wondering when that girl will find love""  ""If Jennifer Aniston can't find love, what chance do the rest of us have at happiness!""  As a journalist covering films and entertainment, these are first few thoughts I chanced upon/overheard about the world's highest paid Girl Next Door, Jennifer Aniston. News of her divorce with (now-ex) husband Justin Theroux made headlines on 16 February, and it's all anyone can talk/opine about.  As is common with news of this nature (by which I mean one that dominates pop culture), what followed next were memes about Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston now being single (hey, have we forgotten Angie is single too?).  Brad Pitt about to drive by Jennifer's house like...#JenniferAniston pic.twitter.com/TRNL9LQaq7 — Jackie (@Jackieannroth) February 15, 2018  tell jennifer aniston i’m single — aidan (@aidan) February 16, 2018  Jennifer Aniston: single ✔️  Brad Pitt: single ✔️ pic.twitter.com/glMAiNSQXz — coloradainútil (@soyluluuu) February 16, 2018  Somewhere, Jennifer Aniston is crafting her ""Hey, let's grab coffee and catch up"" text to Brad Pitt. https://t.co/pXLGo7O4Mp — Madeline Hill (@mad_hill) February 15, 2018  If Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston reunite. This will be me... pic.twitter.com/JflsgV9K9u — Nina Diana (@ninadonline) February 15, 2018  Brad Pitt turning up at Jennifer Aniston's place like pic.twitter.com/u4uGJ57NoO — Daniel (@Daniel_Reilly1) February 15, 2018  Me: *reading about Jennifer Aniston & Justin Theroux split* awww that sucks  Also me: planning Jennifer Aniston & Brad Pitt's second wedding — Ally Reid (@ashallann) February 16, 2018  My reaction to Jennifer Aniston separation news😭but realized both her and Brad Pitt are single😊 pic.twitter.com/RJj9UWxgxg — Hani Lee (@HaniLee1) February 15, 2018  Now who doesn't like a bunch of funny memes? But humour notwithstanding, there are several issues with our response to Aniston's breakup.  First of all, it's a break up. Need I remind any of you what it feels like to end ties with someone who was your partner for over five years (married for 2, together for 7)? It feels like the pits. The last thing you want to do is scroll through twitter and find your face attached to way too many memes about getting back together with a man that left you for another woman. Pretty sure Jennifer, right now, is thinking ""thanks but no thanks"".  We are so obssessed with happy-endings and romance that practicality, self-happiness seem to matter very little.  Has it occurred to noone that maybe, just maybe, Jennifer Aniston wants to be alone? That after a whirlwind of two marriages and much heartbreak, maybe it would better for her to be by herself? Would that be too bad? Why is it so hard for us to imagine Jennifer Aniston being alone? Or single? Does being single automatically mean someone is not happy?  Remember, the statement that those two gave out with the news of their divorce was this: ""This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.""  Doesn't sound any bit the heartbreak to me. If anything, Jennifer Aniston is probably happier being by herself and away from the world's baggage involving her love life. Besides, I'd like to see people trying so hard to couple up the single male actors in Hollywood.  Suggesting that Jennifer Aniston can only be happy if she's with a man, married or in a relationship is not only a perfect example of everyday sexism, it is also shortsighted.  Besides, in my humble opinion, Aniston is way beyond Brad Pitt's league. If she *had* to get together with someone in the near future, I sincerely hope it is with someone new.  Leo DiCaprio, single at 43: wow, LAD what a legend. Jennifer Aniston, single at 49: what’s wrong with her? Why can’t she find love? Why can’t she hang on to a man?#everydaysexism — Kelly Jackson (@Kelly_Jackson88) February 16, 2018  It’s so insulting to Jennifer Aniston that anyone would suggest she’ll get back with Brad Pitt now she’s single. I really hope she doesn’t! — Serena Marchetta (@SerenaEvelyn) February 16, 2018  Updated Date: Feb 16, 2018 17:17 PM"
"Michael Jackson’s daughter, Paris, thanked the late music icon “for the magic” in an Instagram post early Tuesday morning, on what would have been the King of Pop’s 59th birthday.  “Birthday wishes to the love of my life, the one person who showed me what passion truly was, the one that gave me solid morals to live by and how to dream,” she wrote.  The 19-year-old, who made headlines Sunday for speaking out against “Nazi, white supremacist jerks” at the MTV Video Music Awards, shared a 2001 photo of herself kissing her dad. In it, Jackson is seen wearing his iconic white sequin glove.  “I will never feel love again the way I did with you,” her post continued. “You are always with me and I am always with you. Though I am not you, and you are not me, I know with all my being that we are one. And our souls will never change in that way. Thank you for the magic, forever and always.”  In what Rolling Stone dubbed as her “first-ever in-depth interview” following her father’s June 2009 death, the model-actress opened up about the close-knit relationship she had with her father, saying, “I feel him with me all the time.” She was 11 years old when she spoke at his memorial service on July 7, 2009, calling him the “best father you could ever imagine.”  Jackson, who is currently filming the second season of Fox’s “Star,” is the sole daughter of mother, Debbie Rowe, and father. She has two brothers, older sibling Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. and the younger Prince Michael Jackson II."
"Despite all the she-said, she-said in the Taylor Swift/Katy Perry feud, Ed Sheeran said in a recent interview that he thinks the back-and-forth is overblown.  “I don’t think she needs [to be defended] at all,” he told People magazine at the 2017 Songwriters Hall of Fame 48th Annual Induction and Awards Gala. “I don’t think feud songs are a hot thing – there’s always been beef songs.” Sheeran specifically cited Carly Simon’s “You’re So Vain” as an example of a classic “diss track”; Simon revealed in 2015 that she penned the 1972 hit with Warren Beatty in mind.  Earlier this year, Perry incurred the wrath of many Swift fans after the release of her hit “Swish Swish,” which many interpreted as a direct attack on the “Wildest Dreams” singer.  “Don’t you come for me / No, not today / You’re calculated / I got your number / ‘Cause you’re a joker / And I’m a courtside killer queen,” one verse partly reads.  (As though confirming that the song was indeed about Swift, Perry changed the lyrics to hold a more conciliatory tone during a live-streamed concert: “God bless you on your journey, baby girl.” Days earlier, Perry had delivered that same line when chatting with Arianna Huffington about Swift.)  “I am ready to let it go,” she said at the time. “I forgive her and I’m sorry for anything I ever did, and I hope the same from here. I think it’s actually like, I think it’s time. There are bigger fish to fry, and there are real problems in the world. You know what I’m saying? … There’s a lot of other things out there in the world that people need to be focused on, and I truly, like God bless her on her journey. God bless her. Honestly.”  Earlier this month, Swift seemed to make a not-so-subtle point when she announced the release of her entire back catalog on all streaming services – just as Perry dropped her fourth studio album, Witness.  Perry and Swift’s fallout dates back to 2014, when Swift suggested in a Rolling Stone interview that Perry had once stolen backup dancers out from under her, effectively throwing a wrench in their friendship.  Swift’s hit from that same year, “Bad Blood,” is widely assumed to be about Perry.  As for Swift and Sheeran, their platonic friendship is rock-solid. “We’ve gotten matching Scottish folds, made each other arts and crafts Christmas presents, vacationed with our families, and had each other’s backs,” Swift told Rolling Stone earlier this year. “He is the James Taylor to my Carole King and I can’t imagine a time when he wouldn’t be.”"
"Jamie Foxx walked off an interview with ESPN after the host asked the Academy Award-winning actor about his rumored relationship with actress Katie Holmes.  Foxx, 50, was speaking with “SportsCenter” host Michael Smith on Friday before the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in which the actor was playing, E! News reported.  Smith asked Foxx about being prepared for the game before he tried to transition the conversation to the actor's private relationship with Holmes, 39.  “And I know you’ve prepared and I saw pictures,” Smith asked. “Did you and Katie Holmes play basketball for Valentine’s Day? Like some real ‘Love and Basketball’?”  TED CRUZ ACCUSES CNN OF SITTING ON INTERVIEW AFTER CHRIS CUOMO SAID HE’S ‘AFRAID’ TO APPEAR ON NETWORK  Foxx did not answer but instead took off his earphones and attempted to take the microphone off before an assistant helped him, as Foxx looked awkwardly into the camera.  The actor then walked off camera and back to the basketball court where he began to do exercises.  “Uh oh, did we lose him?” Smith asked. “Oh, he ready to go, he ready to hoop.”  Foxx and Holmes have kept a low profile of their rumored relationship that reportedly began in 2013. The two were photographed walking together in Los Angeles Wednesday, Valentine’s Day, while carrying a basketball.  A source told People the couple likes to keep their relationship private – especially Foxx.  OPRAH SAYS SHE’S WAITING TO HEAR FROM GOD ABOUT 2020 RUN, AFTER JOY BEHAR MOCKED PENCE FOR LISTENING TO JESUS  “Jamie and Katie’s relationship is not a secret but they both like to keep it under the radar,” the source told the magazine. “They have nothing to hide but Jamie, especially, is very low key about his life in general, and rarely talks about it. He is not one to acknowledge anything about his private life and neither does Katie.”  Foxx’s team, the Clippers, ended up beating the rival team, the Lakers, 75-66. Other celebrities who played included Justin Bieber, Nick Cannon, Drew Scott and Michael B. Jordan."

"God save Meghan Markle! The Duchess Of Sussex has run into some issues when it comes to her royal behavior, but she has her husband Prince Harry to support her through it!  Meghan Markle was just accused of breaking royal protocol and “disrespecting the Queen” when she crossed her legs at a royal engagement. Shortly after, she attempted to hold Prince Harry’s hand in public — which just isn’t what the royals do. Still, she’s only been a Duchess for a month and a half, so the Royal Family is cutting her some slack, even though she’s incredibly hard on herself. “Meghan does worry about messing up, she worries terribly, because she wants to do everything perfectly, so she really beats herself up when she gets even the tiniest thing wrong. But, there is so much to remember, so many minuscule little details, it’s kind of mind-blowing really–and all incredibly high pressured too, as it’s all under a microscope at the same time,” a palace insider told HollywoodLife.com exclusively.  “The funny thing is that the Queen is actually incredibly gracious to Meghan, she doesn’t put any pressure on her at all, it’s actually quite the opposite, and Harry is so loving and supportive, he’s constantly telling Meghan how amazing she’s doing, and how quickly she’s learning, and she is!” Aww! Listen, if the Queen doesn’t have a problem, we don’t have a problem.  At Meghan and Harry’s royal nuptials on May 18, the duchess seemed ready to commit to her role as a royal — singing God Save The Queen flawlessly, and crossing her legs at her ankles. Her few faux pas, while understandable to the royal family, are reportedly devastating to her. “The British press is constantly jumping on each and every little faux pas though, and publicly reprimanding Meghan, it’s horrible really, and some days she ends up in tears,” the insider revealed. “Harry is so protective of Meghan, and he hates how some of the newspapers write about her, it reminds him of his mother, and the way she was treated by the press, and sometimes Harry worries that nothing has really changed.” Recall, the British tabloids were incredibly tough on Princess Diana, but if Meghan is anything like her she’ll continue to handle herself with impeccable class!"
"Speaking with Michelle Miller, the British actor admitted to opting for more independent movies after he shot to superstardom playing vampire Edward Cullen in the wildly popular Twilight series. On auditioning for entirely different roles post-Twilight, Pattinson said, “It’s not like, ‘Oh, I’ll come down from an ivory tower to be…’ I mean, these movies are hard for me to get. Literally, I’m just as much trying to convince people, like, every single time. And it’s not like I’m, like, Leo [ DiCaprio ] or something!”  In the interview, it was revealed Good Time producers Josh and Benny Safdie were initially hesitant to work with Pattinson, but later discovered their opinions on the actor were far from accurate. On breaking free from his once perceived image as a teen heartthrob, the star said, “I think so much of life people are trying to put you in a box and define you all the time.” He continued, “It’s just exciting to have a job where you’re allowed to consistently break the walls of the box around you.”  Pattinson went on to talk about the vast amount of media attention he’s received since taking on the role of a lifetime in the Twilight series, despite his best-efforts to keep his personal life under wraps. “I’m quite an open person,” he said. “I don’t want to be one of those people who’s just like, ‘Oh, no comment,’ ’cause I just think you just look like an idiot if you’re in it. But then the annoying thing happens as well, then you answer in these kind of vague ways which kind of create these weird conspiracy theorists.”  The star added, “I don’t know how to deal with it. And so I thought in a way to kind of stop feeding it, you just try and say ‘I don’t wanna talk about it.’ And also, it kind of makes you feel like that’s the only way you can get some kind of strength.” Watch Pattinson’s full interview below!"

"The Anti-Defamation League says Larry David’s Saturday Night Live monologue – in which the Curb Your Enthusiasm creator pondered his dating options in a concentration camp – was “offensive, insensitive & unfunny all at same time.”  The ADL’s stance, tweeted by the organization’s CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, was in line with plenty of Twitterers who started slamming the bit before the show’s cast made its goodnights.  “He managed to be offensive, insensitive & unfunny all at the same time Quite a feat,” wrote Greenblatt.  Watched #LarryDavid #SNL monologue this AM. He managed to be offensive, insensitive & unfunny all at same time. Quite a feat. — Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) November 5, 2017  David’s monologue – watch it above – started out with the comic’s standard self-deprecation, joking about being a total loser during his single New York days. Then he pivoted to riskier territory – Hollywood’s recent flood of sexual harassment allegations.  “I couldn’t help but notice a very disturbing pattern emerging, which is that many of the predators are Jews,” said David, whose Curb Your Enthusiasm once included a plot about mistaking Survivor cast members with camp survivors, said. “I don’t like it when Jews are in the news for notorious reasons.”  “I know I consistently strive to be a good Jewish representative,” David said after a crude joke about Harvey Weinstein. “When people see me, I want them to say, ‘Oh, there goes a fine Jew.’”  Then he dove in head first.  “I’ve always been obsessed with women and often wondered, if I’d grown up in Poland when Hitler came to power, and was sent to a concentration camp, would I still be checking out women in the camp? I think I would.”  “Hey Shlomo, look at the one by barracks 8,” David continued. “Oh my God, is she gorgeous?!… I’d like to go up and say something to her.  “Of course, the problem is there are no good opening lines in a concentration camp: ‘How’s it going? They treating you OK? You know, if we ever get out of here, I’d like to take you out for some latkes.”"
"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)  Pusha-T isn’t going to hear Drake out.  Shortly after Pusha used a picture of Drake in “blackface” as the cover for his diss track “The Story of Adidon,” Drake tried to explain how the controversial photo, which he dubbed “art,” came to be.  “This picture is from 2007, a time in my life where I was an actor and I was working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles, being stereotyped and typecast,” the rapper wrote in a note on social media. “The photos represented how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment.”  “This was to highlight and raise our frustrations with not always getting a fair chance in the industry and to make a point that the struggle for black actors had not changed much,” he added.  But Pusha, who’s been trading jabs with Drake since last month, doesn’t buy what the Canadian rapper is selling.  “See, I don’t know. I just know that me being a black man, that’s something I’m totally against,” the rapper told GQ. “I’m just like, ‘How could you be that comfortable, ever?’ Just for me, there’s no way that’s ever comfortable.”  When reminded that Drake said it was to highlight the struggle for black actors to get roles, Pusha responded, “That’s not an explanation that I would accept.”"
"Chris Pratt returned to Instagram for the first time since he and ex-wife Anna Faris announced their separation in August after eight years together.  The Guardians of the Galaxy star, 38, went to a screening of Thor: Ragnarok with his adorable son, Jack, and friends on Friday, November 3. The doting dad shared a sweet snap on Saturday, November 4, of himself posing with his son and a pal as they stretched out their arms and made muscles in front of a Thor poster, captioning it as “HOLY CRAP!! THOR RAGNAROK IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! We just laughed our asses off!!! So proud to be part of the Marvel universe.”  HOLY CRAP!! THOR RAGNAROK IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! We just laughed our asses off!!! So proud to be part of the Marvel universe. A post shared by chris pratt (@prattprattpratt) on Nov 3, 2017 at 9:34pm PDT  An eyewitness tells Us Weekly that the Office alum snacked on a giant tub of popcorn as he watched the movie at the Arclight Hollywood with his son and a female and male friend.  The photo marked the first time Pratt posted on his formerly active social media account and his fans took notice, with many of them welcoming him back to Instagram.  As previously reported, Pratt and Faris, with whom he shares custody of their 5-year-old son, announced their separation in joint statements in August on social media, which have since been deleted. The former couple met on the set of Take Me Home Tonight in 2007 and wed in 2009.  “We are sad to announce we are legally separating. We tried really hard for a long time, and we’re really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep the situation as private as possible moving forward,” the statements read. “We still love each other and will always cherish our time together.”  The exes remain friendly, with Pratt telling photographers that Faris “did great” at the 2017 Emmy Awards in September: “Anna did an amazing job. She rules! She was great. Her and Allison [Janney], they both looked great.”  Likewise, the Mom star, 40, had nothing but kind words about Pratt during an appearance on Live With Kelly and Ryan in October, where she said, “We’re great friends and we always will be … Life is too short.”  Faris has most recently been linked to cinematographer Michael Barrett.

"Keeping Up With the Kardashians season 15 was a labor of love for the famous family. “It’s like nursery school — there are so many babies!” Kris Jenner, 62, tells Us Weekly exclusively in the new issue. The momager was of course referring to her nine grandchildren.  The Kardashian-Jenner crew grew quite a bit in last few months.

Then Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian became first-time moms (They have daughters Stormi, 5 months, and True, 3 months, respectively.)  Kris marvels at how Kylie has adjusted to parenthood. “Kylie is more calm than I was,” she tells Us. “I look at the way she she loves Stormi and takes care of her. She doesn’t go anywhere without her.” The businesswoman is equally in awe of Khloe — through she never doubted the Good American denim cofounder’s mothering skills.  “I knew she would be amazing. She is always the one who has her house stocked with goodies and takes care of everyone else’s kids,” Kris gushes. “They all want to have the sleepovers at Auntie KoKo’s. True is the light of her life.”  Just before Khloe gave birth, videos and photos surfaced of her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, getting close with other women during her pregnancy.

"CLOSE The 2018 Coachella lineup is here and better than ever. Time  Beyonce and Eminem are two of the headlining acts for Coachella's 2018 festival. (Photo: Getty Images)  Beyoncé, The Weeknd and Eminem will headline the 2018 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the Goldenvoice promoters have announced — ending a 14-month guessing game about who would join Beyoncé as the top acts at the two-weekend event April 13-15 and April 20-22 at the Empire Polo Field in Indio, Calif.  It comes as little surprise. Earlier it was reported by Consequence of Sound that Eminem and The Weeknd would be joining Beyoncé for this year's festival, but requests for confirmation of the new headliners were not returned from producers.  Beyoncé, who has made guest appearances at Coachella with husband Jay-Z and her sister, Solange, was supposed to headline at last year's music festival, but had to postpone after becoming pregnant with twins.  Passes go on sale at noon PT Friday at coachella.com. General admission passes are $429, including fees and taxes, while the Festival Pass and Shuttle Combo is $504. VIP Festival Passes are $999 and VIP parking is $150.  Additional general admission passes traditionally go on sale for Coachella Valley residents a few days before each show, but that hasn't been announced.  The new emphasis on hip-hop and R&B, which have supplanted rock as the most popular pop music forms, includes rappers like Tyler the Creator, Vince Staples, Migos, Post Malone and new sensation, Cardi B, who currently has her first three releases in the top 10 of the Billboard charts, becoming only the third artist to debut with three singles in the top 10 along with The Beatles and Ashanti.  Eminem, one of the biggest Grammy Award-winning rap artists of all time, returns to Coachella on a Sunday night after making a guest appearance with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg in 2012 in the now legendary set featuring a hologram of Tupac Shakur.  Appearing on the same day as Eminem is the saxophone player who made a name for himself with Kendrick Lamar, the jazz-steeped Kamasi Washington.  Top R&B artists on the bill besides Beyoncé and The Weeknd include SZA, who recently headlined Saturday Night Live, Grammy winner Miguel and Daniel Caesar, who is breaking this year out of Canada. Appearing as somewhat of a godfather of that genre is Chic, featuring the influential Nile Rodgers, which had R&B dance hits such as Everybody Dance and Le Freak in the 1970s.  Various genres of rock are represented by the return of War On Drugs, the sister group HAIM, the Brian Wilson-influenced Fleet Foxes and Portugal. the Man. All have played previous Coachellas, although Portugal. the Man finally broke into the pop upper echelons this year with its mega-hit Feel It Still.  The godfather of that genre making an appearanceis David Byrne, the leader of the new wave band the Talking Heads, who have been high on the wish list for a Coachella reunion since the festival's inception in 1999.  Electronic music also has been drawn bigger crowds at Coachella in recent years than rock and its mix with pop music well represented with Kygo, Chromeo and ODESZA.  Other noteworthy artists of that genre include Petit Biscuit, a French DJ and music producer who turned 18 less than two months ago. He is half of the indie-pop duo Mount Dreams, but released his first solo album, Presence, in 2017. He'll perform on Sunday, as will British house DJ and music producer Hannah Wants, a former professional women's soccer player.  The lineup appears to have been booked with a sensitivity to increasing female participation and ethnic diversity. An interesting booking is Los Angeles Azules, a Mexican group fusing traditional cumbia and electronic music.  The festival has become known in the industry for its leadership in fine art and cuisine, and this year will again offer the four-course Outstanding in the Field dinner in the VIP Rose Garden for $225 a person.  Coachella has dominated industry polls as the top outdoor music event since it began in 1999. It was recently named the Billboard Top Festival of the Year. It grossed a record $114 million in 2017, marking the first time a recurring festival franchise has crossed the $100 million mark at the box office.

"Taylor Swift's ""Gorgeous"" is about her new boyfriend Joe Alwyn, Swift confirmed to her fans, but a certain ex also makes a lyrical guest appearance. In the released song, the lyric is ""I've got a boyfriend/He's older than us/He's in the club doing I don't know what,"" which led some to believe the line was about Calvin Harris (DJ, who's 33) or Tom Hiddleston (British actor, 36, the last boyfriend Swift was with before getting with Alwyn; she dated Hiddleston immediately after Harris.)  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  But in a new behind-the-scenes, making of the song video that AT&T released today, Swift sings her original lyrics for the song. She toys with the ""I've got a boyfriend"" line for a bit, and, during one song-writing session, seems keen on this lyric, which leads into the ""You're so gorgeous"" chorus:  I’ve got a boyfriend/he’s older than us/I haven’t seen him in a couple of months/I go through phases when it comes to love/I’m nothing that you want, but I must say you're so gorgeous...  Watch it at the 3:00 mark:  At first glance, this could suggest the ex Swift is singing about is Harris; the two spent a lot of their relationship apart because of Swift touring for 1989 and Harris playing DJ gigs around the world. Swift went to the Met Gala, the night she and Hiddleston hit it off, alone.  But Swift dated Hiddleston right before being seen for the first time with Alwyn in October 2016. Hiddleswift first got together in June and lasted until September.  A lot of the time during their relationship, Hiddleston was in Australia shooting Thor: Ragnarok—Swift even visited him over there and was spotted with the Thor cast at the movies—after they had a pretty intense start.  Hiddleston and Swift arriving in Australia together in July 2017. Getty Images  At the time of the Hiddleswift split, a source told E! that Swift ""felt he wanted to take the relationship to be too public, and she was not happy about it and thought it was too much publicity."" If this original ""Gorgeous"" lyric really is inspired by Hiddleston, it may have been that the flame the two had also burned out (perhaps Hiddleston's alleged thirst for publicity extinguished it), and Swift moved on."
"The 'Scorpion' star and longtime music producer are planning to tie the knot.  Katharine McPhee and David Foster are engaged, The Hollywood Reporter can confirm.  The Scorpion actress shared an engagement ring emoji on Twitter, along with a meme of Ariana Grande posing for photographers and giving a hair flip. ""And what about it?"" the post reads.  According to TMZ, Foster, 68, asked for 34-year-old McPhee's hand in marriage during the couple's recent European vacation. The outlet reports that McPhee flaunted her engagement ring to family members via FaceTime on Sunday, while spending the day on the Italian island of Capri with Foster.  The pair first met on the set of American Idol when McPhee was a contestant and Foster appeared as a guest mentor in 2006. They started dating last year. Though they kept their romance under wraps for months, McPhee and Foster confirmed their relationship status when they walked the 2018 Met Gala red carpet together in May.  McPhee previously opened up about Foster's bond with her family during an interview with ET Canada.  ""He actually finds a way to make my family feel more special, like, when my family's around. My sister was super-pregnant and he was taking care of her when we were at this tennis match together,"" she said. ""He just always is so considerate of others.""  McPhee was previously married to actor Nick Cokas from 2008 to 2016, while Foster was wed to model and former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Hadid from 2011 to 2017. His ex-wives also include songwriter Linda Thompson, Rebecca Dyer and singer B.J. Cook."

"Kylie Jenner is on the cover of Forbes' ""America's Women Billionaires"" issue. Forbes Magazine  Kylie Jenner may be the youngest sibling of the Kardashian/Jenner clan, but she is also the family member bringing in the most cash.  Jenner, who's on the cover of Forbes' August 2018 ""America's Women Billionaires"" issue, is worth roughly $900 million, according to the magazine.  According to Forbes' calculations, that makes her not only the Jenner or Kardashian with the highest net worth, but the 27th-richest self-made woman in the United States. For comparison, Forbes estimates that Jenner's older sister Kim Kardashian West is worth roughly $350 million.  Jenny Cheng/Business Insider  The 20-year-old's net worth has skyrocketed thanks to the success of Kylie Cosmetics. Forbes conservatively values the company at $800 million, with an estimated $330 million in sales last year. Jenner is both the face of the company and the sole owner.  Forbes' Natalie Robehmed detailed how Kylie Cosmetics has found success by harnessing Jenner's immense social-media following and slashing costs by outsourcing labor. There are only five full-time employees, with Jenner's mother, Kris Jenner, handling finances and public relations in exchange for a 10% management cut, the report says.  Kylie Cosmetics is dealing with slowing growth — Forbes reports that revenue grew just 7% last year, with lip-kit revenue dropping an estimated 35%.  However, the magazine says it would take more than a slow year of sales to stop Jenner from reaching billionaire status and making history.  ""Another year of growth will make her the youngest self-made billionaire ever, male or female, trumping Mark Zuckerberg, who became a billionaire at age 23,"" Robehmed reported."

"A member of Bachelor Nation has passed away.  Michael Nance — who competed on Emily Maynard‘s season 8 of The Bachelorette — has died, PEOPLE has confirmed.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  A representative for the Austin Police Department tells PEOPLE the precinct received a 911 call shortly after 2 p.m. on Monday and arrived at the scene to find Nance, 31, unresponsive. He was rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  No cause or manner of death has been determined yet, though Nance’s death does not appear to be a result of foul play. An autopsy is being performed Tuesday, with toxicology results expected to take weeks.

It all starts out fun and then somewhere along the road, it just turned into something else. It’s a vicious cycle and it ate away at me for a long time.”  “I’m almost two years sober, now, and it’s not that easy — you have to completely change your way of living,” he continued. “But my life is really, really good today. … I’m happy and I’m content, but there are things missing in my life. I would like to fund my soulmate.”  Following his appearance on The Bachelorette, the musician and Austin native starred in a music video for his song “The Heezy.”  After learning about Nance’s passing, several members of Bachelor Nation took to Twitter to express their condolences, including Maynard.  “So sad waking up to the news about Michael Nance.

"“Keith and I are pretty strict with the boundaries on what we allow, in terms of work, into our home,” the 51-year-old told Grazia magazine. “I just got the office out of my house, and it’s the best thing I’ve ever done. We don’t even have a TV in our bedroom; we’re that couple. And no computers in the bed.”  She added that she and her country crooner hubby are particularly strict about what projects they choose, now that they’re parents to daughters Sunday Rose, 10, and Faith, 7. “The thing you really learn when you have children and a career — and particularly when you’re an older mother — is the preciousness of time, and therefore trying to balance everything and be willing to say no to things,” she told the publication, before adding that she’s “not willing” to miss bedtime.  In a new interview, Keith admitted that he’s so head-over-heels for his wife that watching her character, Celeste Wright, be abused on the hit show Big Little Lies was difficult. “It’s hard because she really tells her story,” Keith admitted to The London Evening Standard. “I love how committed she is, though, in telling her stories. She had the bruises to prove it.”  Despite the agony he felt watching his wife, he’s very supportive of her craft. In fact, he even creates his schedule based around where she’s filming. “We have a tutor that travels with us, so if Nic’s shooting a film for any long period of time, even if I’m touring, we can almost always relocate to wherever she is. And I’ll go to and from there.

The Olympic gold medalist who has been an outspoken activist for transgender rights, told radio host John Catsimatidis that she is interested in the ""the political side of activism"" and ""would look for a senatorial run.""  ""Can I do a better job from the outside?"" said Jenner, a lifelong Republican. ""Kind of working the perimeter of the political scene, being open to talking to anybody? Or are you better from the inside, and we are in the process of determining that. Yeah, but I would look for a senatorial run.""  When asked whether Jenner is seriously considering a run and if she would run as a Republican or an independent, her publicist, Alan Nierob, told CNN Monday that there are ""no further details to report at this time.""  This comes after wrestling star and actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson said that he would consider running for president in 2020, musician Kid Rock insisting last week that his tweet about running for the Senate is no joke and, in perhaps the most viral moment of celebrities exploring a run for office, Kanye West declaring a 2020 presidential bid during his speech at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.

"Jennifer Lopez did not secretly wed Alex Rodriguez and she’s still not engaged, this coming straight from the horse’s mouth.  The “Dinero” singer stopped by KTU’s Cubby and Carolina Bermudez radio show on Tuesday morning and confirmed there has been no proposal from her former MLB star beau … and there hasn’t been a secret ceremony either.  “I’m not engaged. I’m not engaged. No, no,” she said.  Rumors began swirling when JLo sported what some say looked like an engagement ring on that finger over July 4th weekend, but as The Blast exclusively reported, no engagement went down.  She continued to wear the ring on her wedding finger though, even displaying it this AM.  When asked by the hosts if they ran off to tie the knot, she jokingly screamed, “NO!”  And while no engagement or ceremony has happened for the couple of over a year, JLo couldn’t stop gushing about her relationship with A-Rod.  “I think maybe if we would have met in our twenties, maybe not so much … we were both … we’re too crazy,” JLo said. “But now at this point in our lives, where we both have kids, we both have accomplished certain things in our careers and we’re kinda in that second act of our lives, we really complement each other.”  She added, “Where I need help, he’s really strong and where he needs help, I’m really strong. When two people kind of just fit together really well, he and I are like that.”  When it comes to the kids, JLo says all four are amazing. “I mean, of course I’m going to say that cause I’m their mom, but they are and they’re sweet and they’re loving and they deal with us and our lifestyle in such a great way,” she said, referring to her twins and A-Rod’s daughters, whom she just spent her birthday weekend with.  “I’ve had other relationships where it’s been tricky but with these four it really works nicely,” she added."

"$25 million later, Angelina Jolie has a new home in Los Angeles! Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house? Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?"
"Conrad Hilton has been arrested again.  LAPD spokesperson Jenny Houser confirmed to PEOPLE that the 23-year-old heir to the Hilton family fortune was arrested early Saturday morning on charges of grand theft auto and violated a restraining order.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  His bail has been set at $60,000, the LAPD told PEOPLE. It is not clear if he has retained an attorney.  The youngest brother of Paris, Nicky and Barron Hilton, Conrad had allegedly tried to break into the home of voice actress E.G. Daily, TMZ reports — violating a 2015 restraining order E.G.’s daughter, Hunter Daily Saloman, had against him.  Hunter and Conrad had dated previously, but split in 2015. He was arrested in June 2015 for violating the restraining order, after police found him inside Daily’s home.  A radio call came into police at 4:50 a.m. on Saturday, Houser said.  Prior to that, Conrad had allegedly gone to the home of Rick Salomon — Hunter’s father and E.G.’s ex-husband, TMZ reports. There, he allegedly stole Rick’s Bentley.  As fans of the Hilton family may remember, Rick had starred with Paris’ in her infamous 2004 sex tape.  Conrad last made headlines in Aug. 2016, when he was released from prison after serving two months for violating his parole.  He has been on parole since 2015, and previously admitted in court on June 6 to violating the terms of his parole by using drugs — including marijuana, synthetic cannabinoids and cocaine.  In March 2015, Conrad plead guilty to assault for making threats against both passengers and flight attendants on an international flight from London to Los Angeles in July 2014. According to a criminal report obtained by PEOPLE, witnesses reported that he shouted profanities at crew and passengers, including, “I am going to f—— kill you!”  The son of Kathy and Rick Hilton was ordered into a substance abuse treatment center in January 2016 for at least 90 days after allegedly failing drug tests and violating his parole.  In 2008, Conrad was arrested for a DUI after another driver observed his black Mercedes driving erratically on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. Just 18 at the time, he was sentenced by a Malibu court to three years probation and two alcohol education classes — while his license was suspended for a year."

"Phaedra Parks has parted ways with The Real Housewives of Atlanta after the shocking reunion episode on Sunday, May 7. Watch all the highlights from the explosive finale in the video above.  A source confirms to Us Weekly that the 43-year-old attorney will not be returning for season 10 after starring on seven seasons of the hit reality show. “Phaedra is not coming back as of now,” a source tells Us. “Bravo is not planning to ask her back.” (Bravo had no comment.)  Parks’ departure comes after the finale of the four-part season 9 reunion revealed that she spread a rumor that Kandi Burruss and her husband, Todd Tucker, were planning to drug and take home fellow cast member Porsha Williams. When host Andy Cohen said that she was caught in a “megawatt lie,” Parks said, “What more can I do? I apologized already and the person I’m most concerned about is Porsha. I’m sorry that it hurt Kandi as well.”  A source previously told Us in late April that the reunion episodes were “disastrous” for Parks. “It would be understandable if Phaedra didn’t come back, but it’s not finalized yet,” the source said. “It wouldn’t be Phaedra’s decision, but Bravo’s. It’s bad.” The insider added that that Parks’ actions were “incredibly painful and shocking.”  At the time, Parks’ rep slammed the rumors that the lawyer was fired as “untrue.”  Parks’ exit could mean more screen time for Kim Zolciak-Biermann, who will be returning to RHOA for season 10. The Don’t Be Tardy star “won’t be a full-time Housewife, but will be in a smaller role,” a source told Us in April. “How many episodes she’s in is being determined.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

"Share this article:  Caitlyn Jenner made a plea for respect for the transgender community as she accepted the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPY Awards.  “This transition has been harder on me than anything I could imagine,” Jenner told the audience at the Microsoft Theater Wednesday night. “That’s the case for so many others besides me. For that reason alone trans people deserve something vital. They deserve your respect.”  Jenner, formerly known as 1976 Olympic decathlon champion Bruce Jenner, received the award to recognize “the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years,” according to ESPN.  Bruce Jenner, who said he has long suffered from gender confusion and told ABC earlier this year that he identifies as a woman, was re-introduced to the world as Caitlyn Jenner on June 1 with a flashy photo spread and feature story in Vanity Fair magazine.  Later that day, ESPN announced plans to give Jenner the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, which is presented “to individuals whose contributions transcend sports.”  “Bruce has received many accolades over the years for being one of the greatest Olympians of our time but the ESPYs are honored to celebrate Bruce becoming Caitlyn,” ESPYs executive producer Maura Mandt said.  “She has shown the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years, and to embark on a journey that may not only give comfort to those facing similar circumstances, but can also help to educate people on the challenges that the transgender community faces.”  Previous recipients of the Arthur Ashe Courage Award include Muhammad Ali, Jim Valvano, Pat Tillman, Robin Roberts and Nelson Mandela. Michael Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted by an NFL team, received the honor last year.  The selection of Jenner to receive the award has generated some criticism — notably from sportscaster Bob Costas, who dubbed the choice “crass exploitation.”  Some critics suggested that the honor should have gone to Lauren Hill, who was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor but continued to pursue her dream of playing college basketball.  The Indiana native made the team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and played in four games — while helping to raise more than $1 million for pediatric cancer research.  Hill died on April 10 at age 19.  Hours before the ESPYs ceremony, organizers announced in a statement to USA Today that Hill will be honored during the show — noting that the recognition had always been planned, but was not previously announced.  The ESPY Awards honor celebrities from sports and entertainment to recognize major sports achievements and salute “leading performers and performances.”  Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry received the best male athlete award, beating a field that also included Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt.  MMA fighter Ronda Rousey received the best female athlete award over University of Connecticut basketball guard/forward Breanna Stewart, skiing star Lindsey Vonn and tennis champion Serena Williams.

"It's time to say goodbye to a dear friend. We may not have known him for long, but he certainly made an impact on us while he was here. Farewell, King Stache.  Earlier today, Henry Cavill shaved off his beloved mustache, the source of so much controversy late last year. As a tribute, the Justice League and Mission Impossible star posted a video on his Facebook page to honor his former facial hair.  The video features Cavill in a bath robe telling fans that King Stache is indeed gone. He shared it to his page with the simple message ""#ShavedButNotForgotten.""  You can watch the full video above!  ""I know, it's hard to recognize me without King Stache,"" Cavill said to the camera, before turning his attention to himself in the mirror. ""Sometimes, I have a hard time recognizing myself.""  It was only a matter of time before Cavill threw some shade onto the infamous mustache incident. As you surely recall, the actor had the mustache while filming Mission: Impossible - Fallout and was brought back to the set of Justice League for extensive reshoots. Since he wasn't allowed to shave the facial hair due to his obligations to Mission: Impossible, the mustache had to be removed from Justice League via CGI. We all know how that went.  Staring right into the soul of the camera, Cavill said, ""It's hard for me to admit, this it NOT CGI.""  The video concludes with Sarah McLachlan's ""I Will Remember You"" playing over a montage of photos featuring King Stache. Of course, one of these images is the Cavill's CGI'd face, showing how terrible it looked without the mustache.  Fans have mourned the loss of the beautiful stache all morning. Popular fan artist BossLogic even paid tribute to King Stache by creating a poster, bidding goodbye to the facial hair.  So long, King Stache. You may be gone, but you'll never be forgotten."

"In her own words, Barbra Streisand is explaining the decision to clone her beloved curly-haired Coton du Tulear dog Samantha, who died in 2017.  “I was so devastated by the loss of my dear Samantha, after 14 years together, that I just wanted to keep her with me in some way,” the music icon, 75, detailed in an op-ed for the New York Times, published on Friday.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “It was easier to let Sammie go if I knew I could keep some part of her alive, something that came from her DNA,” Streisand recalled. “One of the reasons I chose cloning was because I couldn’t find another curly-haired Coton.”  Before the dog crossed the rainbow bridge, the proud pet owner had cells taken from Sammie’s mouth and stomach.  “We sent those cells to ViaGen Pets in Texas. We weren’t even sure if the cells would take,” Streisand explained, adding, “A friend had cloned his beloved dog, and I was very impressed with that dog.”  RELATED: Barbra Streisand Cloned Her Dog: Here’s the History of Pet Cloning and How Much It Costs  Barbra Streisand and her dog Sammie KMazur/WireImage  While anxiously waiting for the test results to determine whether cloning was possible, Streisand adopted not one, but two dogs in the absence of Sammie.  The first was a rescue: Maltipoo dog Sadie, who is lovingly named after her first dog which was gifted to her by the cast of Funny Girl when she turned 22.  And the second was a straight-haired Coton de Tulear named Miss Fanny, whom Streisand got from Sammie’s breeder after it was revealed that Miss Fanny’s mother is named Funny Girl.  RELATED: PETA Is Trying to Convince Barbra Streisand and Other Celebs to Stop Cloning Their Pets  After welcoming two four-legged members into her family, Streisand was surprised with the call she had been anticipating.  “Not only did the cloning process take, but it produced four puppies!

Describing herself as a “person who was used to taking my dog everywhere with me, and who never had more than one dog at a time living in my house,” Streisand said she chose to give away Sadie to her manager’s assistant and one of the puppies to the teenage daughter of her A&R rep.

But we love them so much. Each puppy is unique and has her own personality,” Streisand said, though she added: You can clone the look of a dog, but you can’t clone the soul. Still, every time I look at their faces, I think of my Samantha…and smile.”"

"Radio personality Leeann Tweeden accused Minnesota Senator and comedian Al Franken of grouping her without consent on Thursday, November 16.  “In December of 2006, I embarked on my ninth USO Tour to entertain our troops, my eighth to the Middle East since the 9/11 attacks,” Tweeden began in a blog post she wrote for the California radio station KABC, where she hosts a morning talk show. “My father served in Vietnam and my then-boyfriend (and now husband, Chris) is a pilot in the Air Force, so bringing a ‘little piece of home’ to servicemembers stationed far away from their families was both my passion and my privilege.”  “Franken had written some skits for the show and brought props and costumes to go along with them,” she continued. “Like many USO shows before and since, the skits were full of sexual innuendo geared toward a young, male audience.”  The model, who said she was “only expecting to emcee and introduce the acts,” then detailed what allegedlyy happened when Franken wrote a skit that included her and a kiss.  “On the day of the show Franken and I were alone backstage going over our lines one last time,” Tweeden wrote. “He said to me, ‘We need to rehearse the kiss.’ I laughed and ignored him. Then he said it again. I said something like, ‘Relax Al, this isn’t SNL…we don’t need to rehearse the kiss.’ He continued to insist, and I was beginning to get uncomfortable.”  Tweeden continued: “He repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said ‘OK’ so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth. I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn’t be so nice about it the next time.”  The sportscaster said she felt “disgusted and violated” and when she performed the skit with Franken on stage, she turned her head so he couldn’t kiss her on the lips again.  Tweeden wrote that on the way home from the tour later that year, she found a photo of Franken putting his hands on her breasts while she was sleeping.  “I couldn’t believe it,” Tweeden wrote. “He groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep. I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated. How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it’s funny?”  Franken released a statement shortly after the accusations broke.  “The first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women,” the statement reads. “There’s more I want to say, but the first and most important thing — and if it’s the only thing you care to hear, that’s fine — is: I’m sorry.”  “I respect women,” he continues. “I don’t respect men who don’t. And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.”  Franken also added, “While I don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit as Leeann does, I understand why we need to listen to and believe women’s experiences. I am asking that an ethics investigation be undertaken, and I will gladly cooperate.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

"By Bang  Jennifer Aniston is ""casually dating"" again following her split from husband Justin Theroux.  The 'Horrible Bosses' star is moving on from husband Justin Theroux and is enjoying ""seeing where things go"".  A source told Entertainment Tonight: ""Jennifer really relied on her friends to get her through the tough times. During that time, she was able to heal and be comfortable with dating again. Jennifer has never felt she needed a man, but she loves love. Jennifer is casually dating, but right now nothing serious. She is just having fun, seeing where things go. She won't fall in love anytime soon. All her friends are around her. That is the best supportive group.""  Neither the 'Leftovers' actor nor the former 'Friends' actress have spoken about the split since they released a joint statement on the end of their two-and-a-half-year marriage following increased speculation about the state of their marriage.  They said at the time: ""In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship. Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another."""
"They are the picture-perfect family.  But Spanish model Elsa Pataky has once again spoken about the struggles she and actor husband Chris Hemsworth faced during the early years of their marriage together.  Speaking to Vogue Australia, the mother-of-three confessed: 'We did everything very quickly – I don’t know how we survived as a couple.'  Scroll down for video  'I don’t know how we survived as a couple': Elsa Pataky reveals the secret struggles that put 'pressure' on her marriage with Chris Hemsworth  Chris and Elsa met in early 2010 and married shortly after in December that year.  They welcomed their daughter India in 2012 and their twin sons, Tristan and Sasha, later in 2014.  'We were married and then a year after we had kids. It puts a lot of pressure on a marriage,' the Fast And The Furious actress admitted.  However, after recently celebrating their eight wedding anniversary, Elsa claims the couple couldn't be happier or more in love.  'It puts a lot of pressure on a marriage': Spanish actress Elsa has revealed she and actor husband Chris Hemsworth did struggle during the early years of their marriage  'Every marriage has ups and downs – it’s constant work to be in a successful marriage and stay together forever': Elsa claims their marriage is stronger than ever as they recently celebrated their eight-year wedding anniversary  'I think our years together have been great. Every marriage has ups and downs – it’s constant work to be in a successful marriage and stay together forever. Chris’ parents have been together all their lives, and that’s such a beautiful thing, and their families are so close,' she continued.  The family of five now live in Byron Bay on the New South Wales' North Coast after relocating from Los Angeles.  Chris, known for playing Marvel's Thor, once told BW magazine that he relocated his family to the laidback coastal town because he felt living in LA was 'suffocating and overwhelming'.

And the Thor star recently spilled about how he really feels about false rumours about his relationship making headlines.  Speaking to The Times in January, the former Home And Away star admitted he tries to avoid reading the rumours because they irritate him so much.  'I just try to ignore it,' Chris told the publication of how he deals with the reports.  'I stay off the internet but occasionally someone says to me, ""You might want to react to this one."" Most of the time I'm like, ""Why did you even tell me that? There's nothing I can do about it. It just p**ses me off.""'  'There's nothing I can do about it. It just p**ses me off""' Speaking to The Times in January, the former Home And Away star admitted he tries to avoid reading the rumours because they irritate him so much  It's not the first time the pair have expressed frustration about the 'rocky romance' rumours, with Chris previously taking aim at a specific publication.  Tagging Elsa, Chris wrote on Instagram: 'Looking for a new wife according to @womansdayaus and other misleading outlets! Honey you still love me right?'  In another post which featured Chris looking serious in a Tag Heuer advert, Elsa chimed in with: 'Don’t worry love, I would be mad too if some magazines keep trying to keep us apart,' adding the hashtags #dontcrackunderpressure #seeyoutomorrow #loveyou."

"Hold onto your sanity, Jelena shippers, because your two favorite people might be friends again. According to reports, Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber have been hanging out as friends over the last couple weeks. They've been hanging out with groups of mutual friends, TMZ reports, and The Weeknd is apparently totally cool with it/knows all about it. So are Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber friends for real this time? Did Bieber perform his song ""Friends"" for her and was like, ""Selena, girl, can we be friends plz?"" Maybe!  The exes were reportedly seen platonically hanging out at Gomez's house in Studio City with a group of friends this past Sunday, Oct. 22. TMZ released photos that reportedly show Gomez pulling into her house on Sunday night and Bieber's car following just 10 minutes after. There's also a photo of what appears to be Gomez and Bieber walking out of her house, but only the tattooed arm of a guy can be seen in the photo, so it's hard to confirm that it's actually the Biebs. Still, fans are completely losing their minds, seeing as if their beloved Jelena won't get back together in a romantic way, friendship is a good second.  Try not to faint, Jelena fans, but these are the reported photos of Gomez and Bieber hanging out this past weekend.  Some fans are like, ""OMG YASSSSSS,"" while others are like, ""Meh.""  Gomez and Bieber reportedly got back in touch around the time she revealed she had a kidney transplant earlier this summer.  Gomez revealed the news in a moving Instagram post on Sept. 14 that read,  I'm very aware some of my fans had noticed I was laying low for part of the summer and questioning why I wasn't promoting my new music, which I was extremely proud of. So I found out I needed to get a kidney transplant due to my Lupus and was recovering. It was what I needed to do for my overall health. I honestly look forward to sharing with you, soon my journey through these past several months as I have always wanted to do with you. Until then I want to publicly thank my family and incredible team of doctors for everything they have done for me prior to and post-surgery. And finally, there aren't words to describe how I can possibly thank my beautiful friend Francia Raisa. She gave me the ultimate gift and sacrifice by donating her kidney to me. I am incredibly blessed. I love you so much sis. Lupus continues to be very misunderstood but progress is being made. For more information regarding Lupus please go to the Lupus Research Alliance website: www.lupusresearch.org/ -by grace through faith  One of Gomez's best friends, actress Francia Raisa, was her kidney donor, and Gomez penned a beautiful thank you to her in her Instagram post. Raisa posted about the experience on her own Instagram shortly after Gomez. She said,  I am beyond grateful that God would trust me with something that not only saved a life, but changed mine in the process. This was part of our story, and we will share it soon, but what is important now is that this is not the only story.For more information regarding Lupus, please go to the Lupus Research Alliance website: www.lupusresearch.org -- Love you sis, so glad we’re on this journey together. ❤️ xx  In August, Bieber released the single ""Friends"" with BloodPop. It's about wanting to be friends with an ex, and fans immediately thought ""Friends"" was about Selena Gomez.  BloodPop® on YouTube  The ""Friends"" lyrics go:  Do you wonder why I've been callin'? Like I've got ulterior motives  No, we didn't end this so good  But you know we had something so good  So I'm wonderin'  Can we still be friends? (oh) Can we still be friends? (oh)  Doesn't have to end  And if it ends, can we be friends?  Can we be friends? Can we be friends?  Sounds to me like someone is trying to platonically reconcile with an ex! But honestly, these two probably don't write all of their songs about each other... I'm just sayin'. Gomez has a new single coming out on Oct. 25. called ""Wolves."" She released the ""Wolves"" lyrics on Oct. 24 and they're super romantic. Fans are assuming it's about her current boyfriend, The Weeknd, and they're pumped. But, it's safe to say Jelena shippers are having a good day today."

"Artist, DJ, and producer Tim Bergling, a.k.a. Avicii, died Friday afternoon in Oman, according to a statement from his rep. He was 28.  “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii,” the statement reads. “He was found dead in Muscat, Oman this Friday afternoon local time, April 20th. The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.”  One of the most popular and successful electronic dance-music artists of all time — he scored a No. 4 hit on the Billboard 200 in 2013 with “Wake Me Up” and regularly appeared in the Top 5 of Forbes’ “Highest-Paid DJs” lists — he retired from live performing in 2016 at the peak of his success, citing health reasons. He had suffered from health problems for several years, including acute pancreatitis, in part due to excessive drinking. He had his gallbladder and appendix removed in 2014.  He posted the following statement on his website last year:  “WE ALL REACH A POINT IN OUR LIVES AND CAREERS WHERE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT MATTERS THE MOST TO US.  For me it’s creating music. That is what I live for, what I feel I was born to do.  Related Celebrities Who Died in 2018  Last year I quit performing live, and many of you thought that was it. But the end of live never meant the end of Avicii or my music. Instead, I went back to the place where it all made sense – the studio.  The next stage will be all about my love of making music to you guys. It is the beginning of something new.  Hope you’ll enjoy it as much as I do.”  Bergling was born in Stockholm on Sept. 8, 1989. He began DJing as a teenager and released his first single in 2007. He released a large number of singles and remixes in the following years and rapidly built a reputation as a live act. He broke through with his 2010 hit “Seek Bromance,” which charted in several European countries; he signed a publishing deal with EMI the same year. He explained his chosen DJ name as “the lowest level of Buddhist hell,” chosen because his real name was already being used by another Tim Bergling on MySpace.  His 2011 single “Levels,” which was later nominated for a Grammy Award, vaulted him into the mainstream, charting in multiple European countries and topping the chart in his native Sweden. “Sunshine,” his 2012 collaboration with David Guetta, was nominated for a Grammy for best dance recording. In September of that year, he became the first DJ to headline New York’s prestigious Radio City Music Hall; at those two shows, he previewed a new song with Mike Posner titled “Stay with You.”  His proper debut album, “True,” was released on September 2013, much of which was previewed during his headlining set at the Ultra Music Festival earlier that year. The album featured “Wake Me Up,” a collaboration with Aloe Blacc, which topped the charts in multiple countries across the world and was No. 1 for a record 14 weeks on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Songs chart; it was also the U.K.’s fastest-selling single of 2013. Other singers on the album included Adam Lambert and Audra Mae. He also worked with Madonna during this period and contributed to two songs on her 2015 album “Rebel Heart,” although both parties seemed unhappy with the collaboration and Avicii said the final versions were quite different from his demos.  The extent of his popularity was reflected in a 2014 “Saturday Night Live” digital short called “When Will the Bass Drop?,” with comic Andy Samberg playing a fictional mega-DJ named “Davvincii” (although he was made up to look more like David Guetta).  However, as his popularity rose, his health declined. He was hospitalized in March 2014 and cancelled several tour appearances; not long after, he collaborated with Carlos Santana and Wyclef on the official FIFA World Cut Anthem “We Will Find a Way.” Also that year, he produced a song on Coldplay’s album “Ghost Stories.” He released his second full-length album, “Stories,” in October 2015.  In March of 2016, he performed at the Ultra Music Festival, premiering new material, but 10 days later announced that he was retiring from performing. He made a final live appearance in August in Ibiza. In December, he parted ways with longtime manager Ash Pournouri.  In August of 2017 he released a six-track EP entitled “Avici,” which he said was the first of three installments that would be his next album. He followed a month later with a full-length documentary called “True Stories,” which was largely about his retirement. In it, promoters are seen trying to convince him to continue touring, even though he’s in obvious physical pain. “I looked at myself like, ‘F—, you should’ve really stood up for yourself more there. Come on, Tim!,'” he said of the documentary to Rolling Stone in an interview published last September. “Why didn’t I stop the ship earlier?”  “I needed to figure out my life,” he continued. “The whole thing was about success for the sake of success. I wasn’t getting any happiness anymore. Now that I have more time in the studio, I want to learn as much about other genres as possible. That’s what I love the most – having a session with Nile Rodgers, for instance, and getting an understanding of music that’s invaluable.”  RELATED CONTENT  Musicians, Celebrities Pay Tribute to Avicii  Avicii’s Biggest Hits (Listen)  ‘Avicii: True Stories’ Documentary Reveals Star DJ’s Struggles With Health, Fame and Early Retirement  Avicii’s Life and Career in Photos  POPULAR ON VARIETY"
"Ryan Gosling is about to star in two of the most anticipated films of recent years. First up in the extraordinary La La Land alongside Emma Stone, which has been receiving rave reviews and huge awards season buzz. Then we'll see him opposite Harrison Ford in Ridley Scott's return to the world of Blade Runner. We know he leaves many of his fans rather breathless and light-headed so we suggest you are sitting as we take a look at his greatest movie moment to date and what makes him so incredible.  GETTY Ryan Gosling is about to star in La La Land and Blade Runner  1. Crazy, Stupid, Love – because he’s a true gent. Gosling’s performance as a bachelor in Crazy, Stupid, Love changes the way we view the world when he instigates the re-enactment of the famous Dirty Dancing Scene with Emma Stone. FUN FACT: Did you know that when shooting the scene, Emma panicked during the lift and accidentally kicked Ryan in the throat? It seems like Ryan is a true gent and didn’t take it to heart as the pair have remained firm friends and went on to work together in Gangster Squad. We can’t wait to see the winning duo reunited again in La La land.  2. The Place Beyond The Pines – because he doesn’t take himself too seriously. Ryan’s electric performance in The Place Beyond the Pines blends toughness and vulnerability as he plays a bank robber determined to provide for his son. FUN FACT: They shot the bank robbery scene using real bank staff and customers. Don’t worry, they were told they were going to be in a movie before the heist took place… What makes us love this on screen moment even more is that Ryan didn’t take himself too seriously; he tells MSN “I think I spotted someone filming me on their camera phone as I robbed the place”.  Ryan Gosling in pictures Tue, November 12, 2013 Here are Ryan Gosling's hottest pictures on and off set for you to feast your eyes on. Play slideshow REUTERS 1 of 30 Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone pose with their Golden Globe awards  3. Drive – because he can hold you captive without saying a word. If you haven’t seen the opening scene of Drive, you’re seriously missing out. Drive is a pulp thriller where Gosling plays a cool stunt driver who secretly works for criminals as a getaway driver. The opening scene is one of the most edge-of-your-seat cinematic moments you’ll experience. Gosling’s character has just picked up his latest comrades from burgling a jewellery store and driving them to safety. The greatest thing about the scene is the suspense. It’s held without any dialogue between the getaway driver and the criminals. All that is heard is the police radio as the police officers try and locate the getaway car.  4. Blue Valentine - because his ukulele performance will melt your heart. Ryan plays a character called Dean in Blue Valentine, which depicts the relationship between him and Cindy played by Michelle Williams. It shows the unravelling of their marriage and flashing back to their courtship. Ryan puts on an endearing performance of “You Always Hurt the One You Love” where he sings and plays the Ukulele whilst Michelle tap dances. FUN FACT: Most people don’t know that both actors were asked to perform a special talent but neither knew what the other would do. So, when the scene played out, the actors discovered each other’s surprising abilities at the same time as the film’s audience.  5. Half Nelson - because he shows his acting skills are as great as his looks. As well as his good looks and dazzling charm, we can’t forget that Ryan can seriously act. A momentous scene takes place in Half Nelson where Ryan plays an inner-city teacher who is found taking crack cocaine in a store cupboard by a young student. FUN FACT: The result of such a performance landed him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in Leading Role. 6. The Big Short - because he came back. After Ryan announced his break from acting in March 2013, we were all heartbroken. But thankfully he came back and appeared in The Big Short, giving the best explanation of the housing market collapse in America using Jenga. His great performance alongside Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, Christain Bale and Marisa Tomei won six Oscar Nominations for the film."

"Brad Pitt may be finding love again, but a source close to him EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that the actor doubts the ‘right guy’ exists for Angelina Jolie. Ouch!  After causing everyone who still believed in true love to shudder collectively after hearing that the two of them were breaking up, Brad Pitt, 53, and Angelina Jolie, 42, still don’t seem to be on the friendliest of terms after their split. A source close to Brad told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Brad doesn’t think a long-lasting love is in the cards for Angelina. “Brad is doubtful Angelina can have a successful marriage after theirs failed. Brad knows first hand how incredibly unique and challenging it is being in Angelina’s family. Brad gave it everything he had and is disappointed they could not stay together,” our source says.  Brad is currently rumored to be dating actress Ella Purnell, 21, but he still has a lot of respect for his ex. The source went on to say, “It is difficult dealing with the media, the fame, career, traveling and everything else that goes with being one of the most powerful women in Hollywood. Brad knows what a dedicated mother Angelina is and how hard that can be for even the strongest men to deal with in a relationship.”  We reported earlier about how Angelina invited Brad to go trick-or-treating with their kids, but that Brad wasn’t “having it” with the prospect of any hangout with his ex. Our source added, “Brad understands that the best, most healthy and lasting relationships need lots of compromise so whoever has a shot at marrying Angelina will need to give up a lot to fit into her challenging lifestyle. Brad feels that while he wishes her the best, after several failed marriages for Angelina, the right guy for her might not exist.” While you muse on whether true love exists or not, check out pics of the celebrity couples who had downright painful breakups.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Angelina will eventually find love again?"

"(CNN) George and Amal Clooney have joined the fight against hate groups in the United States.  The couple, through the The Clooney Foundation for Justice, have made a $1 million donation to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) that will fund a joint initiative to combat hate groups.  The move comes more than a week after an August 12 ""Unite the Right"" rally sparked violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one woman dead and 19 injured. Two Virginia state troopers who were monitoring the protests were also killed in a helicopter crash.  ""What happened in Charlottesville, and what is happening in communities across our country, demands our collective engagement to stand up to hate,"" they said.  In the aftermath of the event, President Donald Trump was criticized for his unwillingness to condemn white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in a press conference given days after the unrest.  ""I think there is blame on both sides,"" Trump said during a news conference August 15.  George Clooney appeared to reference the President's comment in an additional statement, provided to CNN by a representative.  ""Amal and I wanted to add our voice (and financial assistance) to the ongoing fight for equality. There are no two sides to bigotry and hate,"" he said.  The Clooney Foundation for Justice was formed in 2016 to ""advance justice in courtrooms, classrooms and communities around the world,"" according to a mission statement on its website.  George and Amal Clooney, who recently welcomed twins, serve as the foundation's presidents.  ""Like George and Amal Clooney, we were shocked by the size, ugliness, and ferocity of the white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville,"" said SPLC President Richard Cohen in a statement. ""It was a reflection of just how much Trump's incendiary campaign and presidency has energized the radical right. We are deeply grateful to the Clooney Foundation for standing with us at this critical moment in our country's fight against hate.""  The SPLC said it tracks more than 1,600 extremist groups operating in the U.S.  Further details about the joint initiative are expected to be announced at a later date, the organization said."
"There’s no bad blood between Vampire Diaries stars Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalder.  Dobrev – who is exiting the supernatural CW series after Thursday’s finale – told E! News she’s thrilled her ex-boyfriend found love with Nikki Reed. (The couple tied the knot April 26 in Malibu, California.)  “When I heard about the wedding, I thought it was beautiful. They look happy, and I am happy, and so I don’t see why there should be a problem with that,” Dobrev said. “The drama is in the media, it’s not with us. But, of course, we’re on a teen drama show, everyone’s going to look for drama. If there’s no drama, there’s nothing to write about.

"Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian AgentsAnonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds — literally.This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.“We have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,” one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people’s actions as “Russian neuro-brain hacking.”When asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were “ridiculous,” “outrageous” and “goofy.” However, Peskov suspiciously asked “vere is Moose and Squirrel?”NSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people’s brains, he’s “never seen anything on this scale before.”The Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.You are all nuts…almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don’t matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands. And just in case you haven’t noticed, Trump’s people have most of the guns."

"Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand[Note: Please view our newest article on Trump’s attack against Deep State assets: FBI RAIDS HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON COLLABORATORDuring the pre-dawn hours on Christmas Day, Delta Force operators launched a precision strike against an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand, says an active Secret Service agent who claims President Trump green lit the operation following a series of telephone calls to United States military commanders and to Thailand Prime Minister Nik Bukharin.A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa, Japan to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, and held position while Trump cleared the incursion with his Thai counterparts.According to our source, the Trump administration learned that Obama, by proxy, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate on the outskirts of the city of Si Sa Ket, approximately 500 km from Bangkok. On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, “Solyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.”Our Secret Service source supports that contention.“Obama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases. He doesn’t keep them in his name, as that would be too conspicuous. The administration has learned about many of them and has been working with foreign governments to seize Obama’s illicitly gained assets. Many of these nations are not exactly friendly to the United States; we don’t know what Trump offered in exchange for rights to seize assets in non-extradition countries or put special operations boots on the ground on foreign soil. I’m sure the price way high. Clandestine missions are occurring right now. The Solyndra mansion was just one of many,” our source explained.At 3:00 am (local time), a pair of helicopters, including decoy craft, airlifted Delta to its destination. They found the mansion deserted; however, according to our source, the dwelling had been recently occupied. The unit commander discovered freshly chopped vegetables and lukewarm coffee in the kitchen; outside fresh tire impressions lead away from the compound. Someone, our source said, must have tipped off the occupants shortly before Delta arrived on scene.Still, Delta did not leave the location empty-handed. They seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese manufactured firearms and explosives. Moreover, and perhaps most disturbing, a maze of underground tunnels, ostensibly used for human trafficking, ran for miles in every direction beneath the surface. Having gathered all available evidence, they requested exfiltration and handed-off control to Thai law enforcement.Under power granted by the ASEAN Declaration to Joint Action on Counter Terrorism, Thai officials confiscated the estate and all remaining possessions contained therein.(Visited 18,013 times, 4 visits today)"

"Meanwhile, he didn't exactly take the news that Kourtney had a boyfriend well. ""I get a little jealous,"" he admitted early on. And as recently as February he was ""still insanely jealous,"" a source told E! News—though, having started dating Richie last September, he doesn't have any more legs to stand on there.  Kris Jenner, who has tirelessly embraced Scott as if he were one of her own kids, noticed right away that he was having issues with Kourtney's new relationship, especially after he put on a robe and got in bed during a trip to Williams Sonoma with her.  ""The situation is extremely hard and complicated, but I do have my own priorities and things that I need to focus on. He's just not my biggest concern anymore,"" Kourtney mused after telling her mom to ask Scott herself if she was so worried about him.  The predictably unpredictable son of a moneyed New York family who became a reality-TV star at 24 and is now invested in the luxury house-flipping trade has had his raw moments with the family before, especially when Kourtney finally let him go in 2015 and he felt that his relationships with Kris, Khloe and Kim were slipping away. But it took literally years before anyone, Kourtney included, knew what was really going on with her and Scott, since the two of them still went on cozy-looking trips and spent as much time with the kids together as possible. It really wasn't until she started dating Younes that the are-they-getting-back-together speculation stopped.  If it has, indeed, stopped."

They share daughters Lincoln, 4, and Delta, 2 — and have worked out the perfect parenting tactic: the “tag team.”  “We switch kids all the time,” the Frozen actress told reporters of her children at Alliance of Moms’ Raising Baby event last month. “Because if I’m talking to the 2½-year-old, and I’m done, I’ll just be like, ‘We’ve got to switch. I don’t want to talk to this kid anymore.’ ”  Bell explained that the kid-swapping is done with good intentions: to give them the attention they deserve.  “You don’t want to be reactive to you kids. You want to be thoughtful, and you want to be setting a good example,” she said. “Sometimes that example is crying in front of them and saying, ‘I’m overwhelmed,’ or ‘I’m sad because of XYZ,’ or ‘I’m just sad because I’m feeling sad. I’m going to let my sad out. And then I’m going to find a way to cheer myself up.’ “  The actress continued, “It’s not about perfection, but it is about being thoughtful and not reactive. So in order to not be reactive, we switch kids a lot.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kristen Bell Says Therapy Is the Secret Behind Her Happy Marriage to Dax Shepard  Bell and Shepard, 42, have been open about their relationship’s “volatile” start and the importance of therapy in their marriage. They also recognize the need to take brief breaks from their kids, even if it’s hard to fit into their busy schedules.  “You just do. There’s no easy way,” Bell said. “Sometimes you don’t, and then you have a stressful couple months, and then you find time to do. There’s no trick to doing it, other than having really good communication with your partner, and being able to say, ‘I’m reaching capacity. So I need to go take a hike today, or I need to go have lunch with a girlfriend.’”  She added, “Something that makes me feel like a woman again.”"
"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have been through a lot over the past six months. Following Jolie’s divorce filing in September, the two engaged in a bitter custody battle before eventually smoothing things out. How did they go from enemies to friends in such a short time?  According to E! News, things went downhill after Pitt was accused of child abuse stemming from an incident on a private plane with his oldest son, Maddox. The allegations created a lot of buzz in the media and led to an investigation by the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services. Pitt was also accused of having a drinking problem and cheating on Jolie with Marion Cotillard, his co-star on the film Allied.  Although the failed marriage appeared shockingly sudden, inside sources claimed the couple had been experiencing issues for a long time.

[Image by Heng Sinith/AP Images]  “Things had been volatile in their relationship for a little while. They had crazy fights and wouldn’t speak for a bit. They would take some time apart, go on location, calm down and miss each other,” an insider shared. “But, no matter how bad it got, Brad, especially, was never planning on walking away. Every so often, Angelina threatened divorce, but in Brad’s eyes, their lives were stressful because they were raising six kids, things were always going to work out.”  Pitt was eventually cleared of the abuse allegations, but not before suffering significant damage to his public image. To make matters worse, the two were fighting a nasty custody battle that granted Pitt only supervised visits with his six children. The situation didn’t turn around until 2016 came to a close.  Jolie was spotted in Cambodia promoting her film, First They Killed My Father, in February. The actress took all six children for the trip and finally talked about the split for the first time. In her emotional interview, Jolie admitted that the breakup had been hard on the family but assured everyone that they were working things out.

And so that is how I’m coping. I’m coping with finding a way through to make sure this somehow makes us stronger and closer,” she said.  Following Jolie’s telling interview, insiders revealed that Brad Pitt was actually in Cambodia with the kids while Jolie was promoting the film. The actor secretly traveled to the country so that he could spend time with the brood, signaling a major shift in his relationship with Jolie.  “They have made some progress and are taking small steps in the right direction. Both are in agreement on putting the kids first. So that part of the equation is better,” an insider revealed.  Pitt’s relationship with Jolie is far from perfect, but it has come a long way since September. Although he was accused of abusing his oldest son, sources claim that Pitt has patched up they relationship and things couldn’t be better.  “The kids have always adored Brad and have a very solid relationship with him,” a source explained.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BTwltdEBhcj/?taken-by=gq&hl=en  The source added that Jolie actually regrets how everything played out in the early months of the divorce. According to ET Online, Jolie recently allowed the kids an overnight stay with Pitt for the first time since the split. The children reportedly enjoyed their short stay with their father, who is now communicating with Jolie on a regular basis.  While Pitt is enjoying more freedom with the kids, Radar Online reports that Jolie is planning on throwing herself a post-breakup party. The actress is allegedly having the party in London and believes it will help her move on and forget about the divorce.  Tell us! Do you think that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt will eventually work out a joint custody agreement, allowing him to see the kids more? Let us know in the comments below.

"Hands shaking and heart pumping, athletes from all over the world take to the podium with tear-stained faces, radiant smiles and unbridled euphoria. They watch in genuine wonderment as their nation’s flag rises and the stadium resounds with the thunderous tones of their national anthem. These awe-inspiring moments draw the eyes of half the world to the Olympic Games, where spectators marvel at the unfathomable tenacity and strength of the world’s best athletes.  Yet those triumphant moments provide only superficial insight into an athlete’s tumultuous trek to victory. Their journeys took stamina and determination, but for too many athletes, it also took much more: their innocence, pride, self-worth and well-being, a merciless charge in exchange for success.  In too many cases, the winner is expected to take it all – the psychological and physical pain, the sexual abuse and the animosity of teammates in silence and with unfaltering national pride. Nowhere is this more evident or troubling than in USA Gymnastics.  Clad in sparkly, red-white-and-blue spandex, the female USA gymnasts are images of strength, grace and patriotism. Winning consecutive Olympic golds in 2012 and 2016, in addition to world championships in 2011, 2014 and 2015, the USA Women’s Gymnastics program has distinguished itself as a force to be reckoned with. The women have not only racked up quite the collection of gold medals, but they have also accrued millions of views and brought abundant media attention to the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics.  During the 2012 London Summer Olympics, 38.7 million viewers tuned into NBC’s broadcast of the Women’s Gymnastics final, where the U.S. women dominated. In fact, in 2012, four of the five members of the “Fierce Five” ranked in the “Top 10 Most Clicked Athletes” on NBC’s Olympics.com, with Gabby Douglas leading with over 23 million clicks to her page. These women are the pride and joy of the U.S. Olympic Committee, not to mention national and international sensations.  You might also like: Michigan State Freshman Claims She Was Gang Raped by Basketball Players  However, recent history has given a glimpse behind the curtain, revealing a revolting and disturbing truth: USA Gymnastics has created a deplorable culture that values its precious reputation more than the health and safety of its athletes. But the thinly veiled facade is beginning to fade, most notably with the well-founded sexual abuse allegations against USA Gymnastics doctor, Larry Nassar, by over 150 women and girls, according to CNN.  Among those victims were gymnasts Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas, Simone Biles and Jordyn Wieber. They each had a story to tell, rife with gruesome details of long-term abuse.  It is the dismaying story of McKayla Maroney, a “Fierce Five” member and silver medalist at the 2012 London Olympics, that perhaps most aptly encapsulates both Nassar’s menace and USA Gymnastics’ negligence. In the fall of 2017, Maroney made a startling announcement via Twitter that Nassar had abused her from the time she was thirteen years old until she left gymnastics in 2016, according to Time Magazine.  “I had a dream to go to the Olympics, and the things that I had to endure to get there were unnecessary and disgusting,” Maroney said. The gymnast recounted a particularly traumatic event on a flight to Tokyo when Nassar gave her a sleeping pill. The next thing Maroney remembered was waking up alone with Nassar in his hotel room enduring one of his “treatments.” She was 15 years old.  While it is shocking that a predator like Nassar was able to worm his way into this esteemed organization and continue his abuse for years without notice, the organization’s handling of the travesty was unprofessional, unpardonable and downright unethical.  While USA Gymnastics commended Maroney’s courage when she publicly announced the horrors she endured, it soon came to light that a year earlier, the organization made her “sign a non-disclosure agreement as part of a financial settlement she needed to pay for psychological treatment,” according to NBC.  On Dec. 20, 2017, Maroney filed a lawsuit on the grounds that the agreement she signed was “hypocritical, immoral and in this case illegal,” said Maroney’s attorney. In response, on Jan. 16, 2018, USA Gymnastics ensured that it would not hound Maroney for any money should she choose to speak out. But even with this turnaround, the sheer reality that this rectification was even necessary is utterly unspeakable.  A symphony of voices rose in corroboration of Maroney’s claims, and 156 women delivered grievous and powerful statements in front of Nassar’s very eyes during a seven-day-long trial. Aly Raisman, team captain of both the “Fierce Five” and the “Final Five,” has become a vocal advocate for her fellow victims and delivered a harrowing testimony at Nassar’s trial.  “I have represented the United States of America in two Olympics and have done so successfully. And both USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee have been very quick to capitalize and celebrate my success,” Raisman said. “But did they reach out when I came forward? No.”  You might also like: Love or a Gold Medal? Two Olympic Ice Skaters Break Up to Win  But the sins of the organization did not develop overnight. In fact, this sickening culture laid down its roots many years ago. The Washington Post reported that since 1982, “more than 290 coaches and officials associated with the United States’ Olympic sports organizations have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct,” spanning 15 Olympic sports. Yet even aside from all the sexual abuse, the organizations’ transgressions still run deep, and if you pay close enough attention to history, the signs are evident.  One of the Olympics most spectacular and inspirational moments for the U.S. occurred during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, when U.S. gymnast Kerri Strug was exhorted by coach Bela Karolyi to perform the last vault on a critically sprained ankle. Despite her injury, she completed the vault, and led the U.S. women to victory over the Russians for the first time ever. However, malevolence lurks even in the Games’ most glorified moments.  The first feeling the video elicits from viewers is almost always one of admiration for the 18-year-old Strug, who somehow miraculously landed on one foot. But when you witness the agonizing pain on this young girl’s face, and Karolyi’s seemingly heartless coercion, the picture slowly turns from heartening to unsettling. To make matters worse, one of the doctors helping Strug off the stage is none other than Larry Nassar himself.  From being forced to practice on broken limbs, doping at the urging of coaches and acquiescing to irrational diets, Olympic athletes withstand unthinkable afflictions and tribulations en route to domination at the Games.  The 2017 feature film “I, Tonya,” provided yet another startling reminder of the cutthroat nature of the Games; it resurrected the 1994 attack on U.S. Olympic ice skater Nancy Kerrigan, which soon implicated Tonya Harding, her own teammate and possible conspirator in the attack.  You might also like: Randolph College’s Meredith Alwine Is Lifting Herself to the 2020 Olympics  Without the most fundamental trust and security shared between teammates, coaches and doctors, the Olympics will cease to be a place where athletes can flourish. It will become their personal hell. Olympic gold medal winner Shawn Johnson even went so far as to say in a YouTube video on her channel, “I think gymnastics is the best sport in the entire world, but if I had a daughter right now, I wouldn’t put her in it.”  With news stories, personal testimonies and unearthed history inundating almost every media platform, it has become increasingly difficult to look past the Games’ faults and focus on their worth. In order to preserve an honorable tradition and progress in a positive way, major reform is necessary.  The U.S. Olympic Committee needs to genuinely recommit itself to cultivating an organization characterized for its emphasis on unity, not duplicity. In addition, the U.S. Olympic teams must forge environments that do not alienate future generations of athletes, but instead encourage and ignite the most inspired work and dedication they can give.  There is a black, rotting hole corroding the Games from the inside, and now is the time to wipe it out. Let the upcoming PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games be the birthplace of a new era, so when these world-class athletes take the stage, country flags ascending and anthems blaring, they can be filled with authentic, unadulterated ardor for the organization and country whose names they proudly bear."
"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Donna Freydkin  Since actress Christina Applegate was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 and had a double mastectomy thereafter, she’s taken steps to change her entire lifestyle, from the food she eats to the rest she gets. She also founded the Right Action for Women, which helps at-risk women pay for MRI screenings and testing.  But the actress revealed in a TODAY.com exclusive that she recently took an additional step to prevent another cancer diagnosis: She had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed. Read on for our conversation with the actress, who’s busy raising her daughter Sadie, 6, with musician hubby Martyn LeNoble.  First off, let’s catch up on your health. How are you doing?  You're the first person I'm telling this. Two weeks ago, I had my ovaries and [fallopian] tubes removed. My cousin passed away from ovarian cancer in 2008. I could prevent that. That’s how I’ve taken control of everything. It’s a relief. That’s one other thing off the table. Now, let’s hope I don’t get hit by a bus.  What message do you want to send to women?  If you’re BRCA positive, it’s highly possible you’ll develop cancer in your lifetime. The first thing is to be really diligent about what you’re putting into your body, as far as what kind of food you’re eating. Organic is expensive. I get that. I don’t want to alienate anyone who can’t pay for that. But maybe skip your morning latte and get organic vegetables for the week. Try to stay away from the foods that are filled with chemicals. Be a little more diligent and carve out as much of the bad stuff that you can. The other big killer is stress. That’s a hard thing to say to people especially right now. We’re living in a bizarre time. We’re bombarded by what’s going on in our world. Breathe deeper. That’s a big one for me. I used to be a stressed out person. I’m not anymore. I try to find the lining in everything in life.  Christina Applegate Stacie McChesney / Getty Images  I know you eat super clean.  We grow our own vegetables. That’s not an option for everyone. But just get a tomato plant! We’re a 100 percent organic house. My daughter is a vegetarian and practically vegan. That’s her choice. That’s how she eats. We’re really conscious about what we buy. Get some kale! Plant some green kale in your backyard and throw it into everything.  It’s pretty impressive that you founded Right Action for Women, because these tests cost a fortune and most women can’t afford them.  We’re at this place where we need to sit down and figure out the future of what it is that we’re doing and get into more of the BRCA tests for women. That’s a huge cost for a lot of people who don’t have perfect insurance. If you do know you have the gene, it gives you an empowerment about your lifestyle. I’ve been a stay-at-home mom and focusing on my daughter the last two years. We’re moving forward now.  It must weigh on you that you have a daughter, and it must make breast cancer that much more of a personal issue  Of course. The chances that my daughter is BRCA positive are very high. I look at her and feed her the cleanest foods. I try to keep her stress levels down. I’m doing everything I can on my end knowing that in 20 years, she’ll have to start getting tested. Hopefully by then there will be advancements. It breaks my heart to think that’s a possibility.  Do you get checked out regularly?  I don’t need mammograms anymore. I don’t have breasts. I go every six months to my oncologist. It used to be every three months. They still check me out as if I had all my parts. That’s never going to go away. If you know you’re high risk, you need to go start as soon as possible.  Otherwise, what’s your life like these days?  I feel good. I keep my life really simple. I’m very fortunate right now to have that freedom to not work. I love being my daughter’s mother and being 24/7 here with her, doing what I need to do, making her meals, taking her to soccer. I work at her school six or seven hours a week. I’m all in. That is my job. I love my life right now. I’ve been very fortunate to be able to take a minute and it’s been wonderful."

"Where there was fire, ashes reman!  After officially ending their relationship in 2015, the Amazing Spider-man co-stars joined the small but growing club of celebrities with friendly separations. And it’s only clear that there’s still much love between former couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.  I mean, the guy teared up when she won her Best Actress Academy Award, for crying out loud! And both Emma and Andrew have said in numerous occasions that even after their split, they still love each other very much.  Well, it seems like those weren’t just empty words.  According to The Sun, Stone has been making multiple trips to London to see Garfield perform in his play Angels in America. She’s watched the show several times and allegedly “always” goes back for a backstage visit. “They have even been sneaking out of the back door holding hands,” a source close to Garfield told the outlet.  While Emma spent some time in the UK earlier this year shooting her new film The Favourite, a further trip to London paved the way for them to reconnect. “Andrew’s feelings for Emma never softened and now they are growing close once again,” the source said.  Emma, 28, and Andrew, 34, enjoyed an on again off again romance for four years. In the early 2010’s, these two were Hollywood’s sweethearts after meeting during screentest for The Amazing Spider-Man. The couple went public in 2011, via the classy and showbiz means of a joint appearance during her Saturday Night Live monologue. Everything is love and smiles until rumors aired that the pair was taking a break from their relationship in early 2015. They finally announced their so-called definitive separation later that year.  Yet, here we are, cheering for Emma and Andrew once again.  “The familiarity they have with each other seems to bring them back to a place to try again and again. So, I wouldn’t say that they are back to being an official couple just yet, but the future is probably going to be something where they are together. It is basically just a matter of time,” the source said.  We choose to remain optimistic!"

"Welcome to the rest of your life, kid.  Beloved chubby-cheeked royal person Prince George is officially on the quest for knowledge.  The 4-year-old eldest son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (and soon to be big brother to a second sibling) was escorted by Prince William to his first day of school at Thomas Battersea School in London on Thursday morning. Because this is 2017, the whole ordeal was captured for Instagram, and thus, for eternity.  Prince George arrives for his first day of school at Thomas's Battersea with his father The Duke of Cambridge PA A post shared by Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on Sep 7, 2017 at 2:03am PDT  The father and son duo were greeted by the Head of Lower School — a woman who could only be described as a blonde version of Kate Middleton — who was clad in a dusty rose dress (the color, not the daughter of Adam Levine and Behati Prinsloo) and sensibly flat shoes.  The little prince looked understandably nervous, replacing his usually jovial grin with a look of grave apprehension as he began to comprehend his fate.

"High-powered stars from pop (Miley Cyrus), R&B (Mary J. Blige), country (Miranda Lambert) and rock (the Killers) will take part in twin tribute albums for Elton John and Bernie Taupin. Revamp and Restoration are due out on April 6th.  “It’s always a huge compliment when an artist loves your song enough to take the time and effort to rework it,” Elton John said in a statement. “As songwriters, Bernie and myself are thrilled when singers we admire and respect as much as those on Revamp and Restoration choose to add their own unique twist in the process. It means that our music is still relevant and ultimately that our songs continue to reach new audiences.”  John and Taupin enlisted an impressively varied group of singers to interpret their work: The albums’ track lists also include Ed Sheeran, Lady Gaga, Q-Tip, Dolly Parton, Chris Stapleton and Willie Nelson.  That eclecticism gives John and Taupin a chance to remind listeners of their musical range. “From day one we borrowed from everything that’s good about American music – whether it’s blues, country, gospel, pop, pure rock – everything got thrown in the mix,” Taupin noted. “… It would be tiring if you just got stuck in one niche your entire career, especially when it’s one as long as ours.”  That long career is now beginning to wind down: In January, John announced that he planned to retire from the road. Before he does so, he will embark on one massive final tour. He’ll start performing at arenas around North America in September.  Revamp Track List  1. “Bennie and the Jets” – Elton John, P!nk, Logic  2. “We All Fall in Love Sometimes” – Coldplay  3. “I Guess That’s Why They Call It the Blues” – Alessia Cara  4. “Candle in the Wind” – Ed Sheeran  5. “Tiny Dancer “- Florence And The Machine  6. “Someone Saved My Life Tonight” – Mumford and Sons  7. “Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word” – Mary J.

According to her birth certificate, which was obtained by The Blast, the new parents named their daughter Story Annabelle.  “There are no words that will ever be able to explain what just happened to my heart,” the proud mom captioned an Instagram pic of their newborn on Thursday, February 8.

"The territorial gains of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the Middle East over the past week have prompted a fresh look at what the U.S. can do to stop the militant group. But lawmakers are still divided about whether a military or political strategy provides the best shot at success.""We need to have a more robust strategy. We need more troops on the ground, we need forward air controllers - we're just referring to air strikes,"" said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. ""We found in Vietnam War that if you don't have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect, but we need to have forward air controllers, we need to have special forces, we need to have more of those kind of raids that were so successful into Syria. We need to have a strategy. There is no strategy. And anyone that says that there is, I'd like to hear what it is because it certainly isn't apparent now and right now.""He said that there should be a few thousand more American troops on the ground to carry out that kind of mission.But California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says the U.S. will not be able to sustain any victories in Iraq unless the government is able to resolve its political differences.During the Iraq War, Schiff said, ""We won Ramadi but it didn't stay won because the political problems that preceded the first Iraq war haven't been solved and that is the Sunnis have not been brought into the government adequately, Sunni forces haven't been adequately trained and integrated into the military.""Until those changes are made, until Iraq makes the political decision to fully incorporate the Sunnis we can add more forces we can win these battles but they're not going to stay won. I think that's the real lesson of the last Iraq War and what's going on now,"" he said.He warned that sending in a lot of American troops could ""aggravate"" the threat that ISIS already poses and risk further escalation of the fight.McCain, for his part, argues that President Obama never should have pulled troops out of the country entirely in 2011 because the 2007 troop surge had succeeded.""George W. Bush at least had the guts to reverse and sponsor the surge which...eventually then succeeded. I wish, I pray that Barack Obama would do the same thing,"" he said.For now, Schiff said there is an ""ebb and flow and a largely stalemated situation in the war against ISIS."" He said he is concerned that the administration appears to be measuring success by the number of bombing runs it is able to carry out in the region.""I think the more important metrics are how are doing in stopping foreign fighters from entering the country, how are we doing in drying up ISIS' resources, how are we doing in working with our gulf allies in fighting the ideological fight within Islam that we're not positioned to fight ourselves, and how are we doing in terms of our military support,"" he said."
"Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been fired for covering-up the truth about what happened during the Parkland shooting.According to reports, following a criminal investigation by Florida Governor Rick Scott, Sheriff Israel will be replaced as early as next week.From Big League Politics: Sheriff Israel is being removed from office for criminal issues, not malfeasance, following an investigation conducted by the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott. The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day.“We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said.According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed.The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?”The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike who quipped that the Broward Sheriff’s office should use the funds to pay for better officer training, not new cars. Leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for Sheriff Israel to resign or be removed by the Governor for his extreme dereliction of duty and failure to prevent one of the worst schools shootings in US history.During the Florida GOP Primary debate in Florida last week, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Rep. Ron DeSantis were asked about the Parkland school shooting. Both Putnam and DeSantis called for the removal of Scott Israel while asserting their support of the Second Amendment.“I would have removed that sheriff from Broward County. He failed his citizens and he should have been removed,” DeSantis said.“Sheriff Israel is under investigation and he needs to go,” Putnam said.Governor Scott is expected to release a statement in the coming week when Sheriff Israel is removed from office. Scott is currently running for US Senate in Florida, and news of Sheriff Israel’s removal is sure to boost his approval rating in what is gearing up to be one of the most important Senate races in the country.In the days following the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Scott Israel was confronted and asked about his support of and affiliation with the Democratic Party and why he chose to blame guns instead of holding his department and the FBI accountable. Unable to withstand tough questioning, Sheriff Israel became flustered and ended the interview after saying, “the only person accountable for this killing is the detestable, cowardly, murderer. He is solely responsible for this horrific act.” However, as the investigation into Parkland has shown, both Sheriff Israel and the FBI dropped the ball and are to blame for their failure to prevent the shooting despite receiving multiple warning signs."
"Caitlyn Jenner is on her way to the Capitol.  The I Am Cait star was spotted jetting out of Los Angeles on Thursday as she made her way to Washington, D.C. to attend the inauguration, where Donald Trump will take the oath of office on Friday to become the 45th president of the United States.  On Wednesday, PEOPLE exclusively confirmed Jenner would be attending and a flurry of reports have since surfaced in regards to whether the 67-year-old Republican reality tv star will dance with Trump, 70, on Friday evening’s inaugural balls.  “This is a ridiculous story,” a rep for Jenner tells PEOPLE. “There have been no discussions about who Caitlyn will or won’t dance with, or if she will dance at all. I can’t deal in hypotheticals and have no idea what any Trump aids hope happens. Of course, real question is if they danced, who would lead?”  RELATED VIDEO: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Assault  Meanwhile, a source close to the star told PEOPLE on Wednesday that Jenner, who has been an advocate of nondiscrimination legislation, sees the event as an “an opportunity to represent and defend the LGBTQ community within the party.”  Jenner was not invited by Trump but will be a guest of the American Unity Fund, a non-profit conservative organization dedicated to advancing the cause of freedom and equal opportunity for LGBTQ Americans.  “Caitlyn sees this as a chance to bring attention to LGBTQ causes and she is committed to protecting human rights no matter the political party in power,” said the insider. “She has no problem speaking out if Republicans fail to protect equal rights.”"

'What I did with Ben and what we did, which was completely mutual, it was in front of cameras, and studio executives, agents, other journalists etc, and in front of like 20 people,' she said.  'It started when the cameras rolled, it stopped when the cameras stopped rolling.'  Speaking up: Appearing on Weekend Sunrise on Sunday, Anne-Marie insisted that her relations with Ben were purely 'professional'  She insisted it was just a 'game' between the two and nothing more.  'That's it. The rest we had very courteous conversation, very respectful. He never asked me to go to his room or anything like that and never, nothing like that!'  She insisted the pair played the 'game' in interviews for ten years and she said she didn't like that the 2004 interview was being associated with the Harvey Weinstein scandal.  Anne-Marie also said she wasn't a 'victim,' despite what people might think.  All for show: She insisted it was just a 'game' between the two and nothing more  Making headlines: Speaking about the Harvey Weinstein (pictured) drama, Anne-Marie said she was once asked up to his hotel room but refused him, saying 'you knew with him right away'  Speaking about the Harvey Weinstein drama, Anne-Marie said he once asked her to visit his hotel room but refused him, saying 'you knew with him right away.'  'Professional settings have to stay professional,' she said, but defended his victims who unknowingly went up to his hotel suite with him.  'When one says no, it's no,' she added.  Anne-Marie recently told The Hollywood Reporter that she was not a victim of harassment at the hands of Ben.  'This was for the camera. You have to understand that we have done dozens and dozens of interviews like that. It was for a show I was producing, so I was not at all a victim,' she said.  The video starts by showing Anne-Marie sitting on Ben's lap facing him as he's heard saying: 'They would like it better if you did the show topless.'  Having her say: Anne-Marie recently told The Hollywood Reporter that she was not a victim of harassment at the hands of Ben  He then turns her around so she can face the camera before he places his head on her chest.  'This is a lovely perfume you have on,' he says as the two hold each other.  He then says: 'You usually show a lot more cleavage than this. What's the story? Why are you covering it up today?'  'It's Sunday morning,' she responds.  'It's Sunday morning? That never stopped you before from getting them ti****s out,' Ben says back to her in the interview that lasted for more than five minutes.  But despite what the video appears to show, Anne-Marie said it 'has been blown out of proportion.'  She told the publication she had an uncomfortable encounter with Harvey, years ago.  'He did invite me once at the Toronto Film Festival to go up to his suite for an interview. Of course I did not go. He said, ""I would be more comfortable in my suite."" I said, ""Umm, no."" I am not saying something would have happened, but I made sure nothing happened,' she said.  Meanwhile, a makeup artist has claimed that Ben 'grabbed her a**' while they were attending a Golden Globes party.

Writer and comedian, Jen Statsky, who is known for her work on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, also tweeted about Annamarie's allegations.

"Brooke Burke filed for divorce from husband David Charvet after six years of marriage on Friday, citing irreconcilable differences, ET can confirm.  The TV host and Dancing With the Stars season 7 champion started dating Charvet, a French actor and singer, in 2006, and the pair married in St. Bart’s in August 2011. They share an 11-year-old daughter, Heaven Rain, and a 10-year-old son, Shaya Braven. In her filing, Burke proposes that the couple share joint physical and legal custody of their kids, and asks the that the court reserve the right for the future determination of spousal support.  Burke -- who is also mother to two daughters, Neriah and Sierra, from her first marriage to plastic surgeon Garth Fisher -- last shared a Instagram pic with her husband back in October 2017. The couple's date of separation is listed as Jan. 23, 2018 in Burke's divorce filing.  The pair did attend an Operation Smile benefit with their kids in Park City, Utah, in March, though Burke was spotted without her wedding ring at the event.  Kim Raff/Getty Images Entertainment  The 46-year-old former DWTS host spent time with her kids over the recent Easter weekend, sharing a sweet pic with Heaven and Shaya at the Candytopia exhibit in Santa Monica, California.  “In love with these 2!” she captioned the shot. “how sweet it is.”  In 2017, Burke opened up about her first divorce to New You, saying, “I regret having a marriage that didn’t work, because divorce is ‘forever’ for children. I regret that my two oldest daughters have to grow up knowing that sometimes a family falls apart.”  “That’s my heartbreaking life lesson,” she added. “But I’m happy that they can see love now.”  See more on Burke in the video below.

"In the absence of one Donald Trump , who hosted a rally for himself in Michigan in lieu of attending the White House Correspondents’ Dinner Saturday night, the MC and comedian Michelle Wolf declined to, as they say, take any prisoners. “Like a porn star says when she’s about to have sex with Trump, let’s get this over with,” Wolf said, opening her remarks. It was the president’s second consecutive year skipping the Correspondents’ Dinner, attendance at which would require him to be able to take a joke at his own expense. (The last president to miss the dinner, as CNN’s Brian Stelter pointed out on Twitter, was Ronald Reagan, in 1981—then recovering from an attempted assassination.)  Among the objects of her scathing one-liners were several White House officials who did attend the Correspondents’ Dinner—for, it seems, they weren’t professionally mandated to fill out the crowd at the Michigan rally—as well as reporters and broadcast journalists across the political spectrum. Mike Pence, Al Franken, Megyn Kelly, Rachel Maddow, Kellyanne Conway, and Morning Joe ’s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski all got a bit of a roast—but perhaps no segment of the speech was quite so noted among audiences as Wolf’s jokes about Trump’s wealth (“Mr. President, I don’t think you’re very rich; you might be rich in Idaho, but in New York, you’re doing fine”) and about Sarah Huckabee Sanders, just in general.  Sanders was reportedly seated in Wolf’s direct line of sight, making the comments all the bolder: “I loved you as Aunt Lydia in The Handmaid’s Tale ,” Wolf said to her. “I’m never really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Is it Sarah Sanders, Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Is it Cousin Huckabee? Is it Auntie Huckabee Sanders? Like, what’s Uncle Tom, but for white women who disappoint other white women? Oh, I know, Aunt Coulter.”  The New York Times journalist Maggie Haberman complimented Sanders’s seeming gameness for taking the criticism—“That @PressSec sat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance, her job performance, and so forth, instead of walking out, on national television, was impressive,” she wrote on Twitter—a perspective that, judging by social media reactions both to her tweet and to the Correspondents’ Dinner as a whole, not all agree with. Kathy Griffin, speaking with The Washington Post after the dinner (she was in the room for Wolf’s speech), said, “Washington is so thin-skinned .” (She would know .) Celebrities like Rosie O’Donnell (whose cover photo is already an image of Wolf), Kumail Nanjiani, and Anthony Bourdain weighed in on social media, largely praising Wolf’s performance—though, of course, conservative commentators and trolls offered the inverse perspective on Twitter as well. See some of the most notable celebrity reactions, below.  But there was perhaps no response as pithy as Wolf's own, in response to Sean Spicer's tweet that ""Tonight's #WHCD was a disgrace."" ""Thank you!"" she responded.  Also, while the president was off in Michigan, remarking, as always, on the size of the crowd at his rally, Wolf closed the night with a reminder: Flint, Michigan, still doesn’t have water."

"It will be a huge lifestyle change. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle pictured. Ben Birchall - WPA Pool/Getty Images  The royal wedding is (almost) upon us. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot on Saturday, about two years after they were set up on a blind date by a mutual friend.  Markle's new life will look drastically different from her life before she met her future husband. Not only will she move from the United States to the United Kingdom and become a British citizen; she'll also transition from an acting career to being full-time royalty.  In the couple's first interview after announcing their engagement, Markle, who is 36 years old, addressed her decision: ""I don't see it as giving anything up, I just see it as a change.""  She added that she had already been working on the television series ""Suits"" for seven years. ""So we're very, very fortunate to be able to have that sort of longevity on a series and for me, once we hit the 100-episode marker, I thought, 'You know what? I have ticked this box and I feel really proud of the work I've done there and now it's time to, as you [Harry] said, work as a team with you.""  In addition to playing Rachel Zane on ""Suits,"" Markle also appeared on the soap opera ""General Hospital."" She's been everything from a United Nations women's advocate to a freelance calligrapher, and she recently shut down her lifestyle blog, ""The Tig.""  While nothing will expressly prohibit Markle from acting, INSIDER's Kristin Salaky and Talia Lakritz reported that royals are forbidden from being politically active and from publicly discussing their political views.  Markle and Prince Harry say they're on the same page about wanting to change the world  Markle's experience marrying into royalty isn't something most of us can relate to. But the general theme of making big life changes for your partner is universal.  As Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg frequently tells young women, ""The most important career choice you'll make is who you marry.""  Legendary investor Warren Buffett said much the same thing in a conversation with Bill Gates at Columbia University. He told the audience: ""The most important decision many of you will make, not all of you, will be the spouse you choose,"" since ""you will move in the direction of the people that you associate with.""  INSEAD professor Jennifer Petriglieri said on an episode of the Harvard Business Review's podcast ""Women at Work,"" that couples, in order to maximize both partners' satisfaction, should have a conversation twice yearly about what they're ""aiming for individually and together"" in the near future.  In fact, in the post-engagement interview, Markle mentioned that she and Prince Harry had had this type of conversation on an early date: ""It was really one of the first things we connected on, it was one of the first things we started talking about when we met, was just the different things that we wanted to do in the world and how passionate we were about seeing change.""  In the same interview, Prince Harry responded to a question about whether he feels a sense of responsibility for Markle leaving acting behind. ""Of course,"" he said, adding that, ""I still have to have some pretty frank conversations with her to say, you know what you're letting yourself in for, it's a big deal, and it's not easy for anybody.""  Prince Harry went on: ""Whatever we have to tackle together or individually, will always be us together as a team.""  More on the royal wedding:"

"I don't know why I chose to watch the Miss Universe Pageant this past Sunday, December 20. I usually don't enjoy those types of shows, but I'm very glad I watched, because I was able to see Steve Harvey make his now-famous mistake in announcing the winner of Miss Universe 2015. My happiness has nothing to do with schadenfreude, though, as I take no pleasure in the suffering of others.  The reason why I felt fortunate to witness this incredibly awkward moment was because it illustrated to me an important lesson both in human frailty and in human resilience. It was one of the worst possible things that could go wrong -- a horrendous faux pas played out in front of an audience of millions, followed by a surprising and excellent recovery which I saw as tremendously reassuring.  When we look at various lists our top fears, the fear of public speaking is always very close to the top, and it's because of of the underlying fear of making a fool of oneself.  Shame is a major source of anxiety for human beings. The sensation of shame is particularly painful because it includes not only feeling bad and stupid, but also small and ridiculous. Public shame is the worst of all. The anguish of being humiliated in front of our peers -- or, worse, those who we're hoping to impress -- can be excruciating.  Many people avoid speaking in public altogether for the express purpose of not allowing themselves to be put in a position that might result in their experiencing shame. Many people would rather do just about anything than speak in public.  So, when Steve Harvey botched the announcement of the winner of Miss Universe 2015, he realized one of our worst fears: he looked really bad in front of the contestants, his bosses and millions of people all around the world.  Mr. Harvey did the thing that we all fear when we contemplate speaking in public. He messed up. But then he turned around and surprised us. He recovered.  We can be so anxious about the possibility of looking foolish in public that our thoughts go no further than to the dreaded possibility of public humiliation.  We can't imagine standing there, as Mr. Harvey did, with egg on our face, having demonstrated our ineptitude to the masses. Equally, we wouldn't have contemplated how we might react if such a situation were to occur. We simply imagine that we'd die, right then and there, or at least wish that we were dead.  What Mr. Harvey showed us -- and why I was so happy to witness his big blunder -- was that we can mess up, look foolish and then we can make things right again.  Mr. Harvey showed us that it's possible for us to fall on our face but then stand up, brush ourselves off and carry on with our dignity intact. He showed us all-too-human fallibility, but also real class, courage and resilience.  I was very impressed by the way Mr. Harvey handled his error. He owned up to it, apologized for it, explained what happened without being defensive, and even begged the audience not to blame his error on the contestants.  He took responsibility for what had happened and he did the right thing. He didn't try to save face, minimize his mistake or laugh it off. He was serious, humble and appropriately contrite. He knew he'd messed up, and he did his best to make things right.  That night, all of us who were watching the pageant collectively cringed as we witnessed Mr. Harvey's mistake. We felt horrible for the young women involved and embarrassed for Mr. Harvey.  But then, as I reflected upon what I'd just seen, I realized that, although it was an incredibly uncomfortable moment, it was also an enormously valuable lesson for all of us to take in.  I really appreciate the way Mr. Harvey handled this situation. In fact, he did millions of people a huge favour. He realized one of our worst fears in as public a forum as one could imagine. And he didn't die. His head didn't explode. He didn't run off the stage and commit ritual suicide.  No, Mr. Harvey messed up, owned up, corrected the situation and survived. And he demonstrated to all of us that we too can mess up and survive, if we're willing to do the right thing, as he did.  So, Steve Harvey, thank you.  I know you weren't planning on being such an excellent role model, but as is often the case when things go sideways, amazing surprises can happen. Amazing choices can be made and powerful lessons can be learned.  The next time I get up on a stage somewhere and I'm about to give a talk, I'll remember Steve Harvey and the Miss Universe 2015 pageant. I'll remember that the worst happened and nobody died. I'll take a deep breath and remind myself that if he could mess up in front of millions of people and survive, I really have nothing to worry about, after all.

When asked if he uses dating apps to meet people, the rapper admitted to using Tinder.  ""And Grindr,"" he said, adding, ""I also used to go to strip clubs. What can I say? Going to strip clubs is how I was meeting some chicks. It was an interesting time for me.""  Whatever works, right?

Kardashian asked the president to pardon Alice Marie Johnson, a woman serving a life sentence without parole for a first-time drug offense.  Before the meeting, Kardashian tweeted a birthday message for Johnson.  Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson. Today is for you 🙏🏼✨ — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 30, 2018  But people on Twitter just couldn't believe that this was actually happening.  If you would’ve told me five years ago Donald Trump would be POTUS and Kim Kardashian would be in the Oval Office discussing prison reform with him I would have called you insane.

Charles Kushner was jailed from 2005 to 2006.  The young Kushner even carried a wallet that his father made for him while serving prison time for his white collar crimes.  Since the experience, Kushner has vowed to make prison reform a key issue as a senior White House adviser, according to Vanity Fair. He's lobbied for the First Step Act, a bipartisan bill that helps inmates transition back into society more smoothly with job training and drug treatment programs. The bill, which passed the House last week, also gives inmates with nonviolent charges the chance to finish their sentences in halfway houses and house arrest. It's also seen its fair share of criticism.  Kardashian has been scrutinized for defending her husband Kanye West after his controversial tweets supporting Trump and far-right figures. But prison reform is something that she's been vocal about in the past; on Monday, she tweeted her support for Matthew Charles, a former inmate who turned his life around after 21 years of incarceration. Charles is required to serve another 10 years because his original release was a clerical error.  This man is sentenced to 35 yrs for selling drugs. He serves over 21 yrs, is released, finds a job, new relationship, starts a new life, & now is being sent back for another 10 yrs because the original release was an error. This man has completely rehabilitated himself. So sad https://t.co/msLsMSHGxh — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 28, 2018  She also shared a tweet about a man who was sentenced to only 90 days of house arrest after raping a child.  Since he doesn’t have to go on the sex offender registry, let it be known in the court of public opinion instead:    His name is LYLE BURGESS in California and he is the founder of auto part company RARE PARTS INC    Spread the word. Let everyone know what he is, since the law won’t. https://t.co/ar2WPtLJG9 — Kelly (@kellyblaus) May 27, 2018  Kardashian has also hinted at political aspirations. In an unaired clip from Khloe and Lamar, she pondered running for mayor of Glendale, a town in the greater Los Angeles area, because of its prominent Armenian population. (It's worth noting that Glendale doesn't have mayoral elections — instead, its city council appoints a member to serve as mayor for one year.) Despite her past misinformation about the town's bureaucratic structure, it's possible that she used this meeting to sow seeds for future political gain.  Kardashian hasn't made a public statement about the meeting yet, aside from tweeting the birthday message for Alice Marie Johnson. Is there a chance we'll get to see a behind the scenes of the meeting on the next season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians? Possibly — although season 15 doesn't have a premiere date yet. A Variety report revealed that the Kardashian/Jenner/West empire milked a deal with E! that will keep them on the air until 2020."

On Saturday afternoon, the Compton rapper shared a screenshot of an emoji-laden text his mom, Paula Oliver, had sent him after she listened to Damn for the first time. It’s a lengthy text that is equal parts heartwarming and hilarious, as she shares her initial thoughts on the album as well as the cover art.  “OMG. This cd is bombbbbb!,” she wrote at the beginning of the text. “You should have put me and your daddy on this one too j/k.”  For those who don’t know, Kendrick’s mom and dad were featured in the skits on Good Kid, M.A.A.D City.

"An explosive report from Life & Style states that their two and a half year marriage was 'dysfunctional from the get-go' and 'never a real marriage.'    According to pals of the former Friends star, Jen would often end up at best friend Courteney Cox’s house in floods of tears.  Getty  'The way Jen sees it, Justin simply refused to change,' says the source. 'Especially when it came to his relationship with other women.'    Just weeks after they announced their shock break up, Justin took to Instagram to promote a homeless pets shelter. However eagle-eyed fans were quick to notice that the star hashtagged Selena Gomez, a former friend of Jen’s and one of many females who Justin was rumoured to have got a little too close to during their relationship.    'Justin is a classic ladies’ man and flirt, and it always drove Jen up the wall,' spills the friend.  Justin and Selena were spotted flirting at a recent awards show Getty  'One of the worst moments for Jen was when she started seeing Justin flirt with her friends.    'Women are very drawn to Justin.

Furthermore, the source goes on to reveal that the former couple shared 'harsh words' over the years about their differing lifestyles – with Justin refusing to leave his bachelor pad in New York and live with Jen on the West Coast.    And in a heartbreaking confession, the insider reveals it was obvious Justin’s heart was never really in their relationship.  'Jen complained he never said ‘I love you'.'    'One thing is certain: She’s done being put through hell by Justin.'  Jen and Justin have not responded to Life & Style’s report."

"The Kardashians have awoken many feelings in their viewers, with one of those feelings being envy. It is sometimes irresistible to not envy them. I mean, come on!! Their jobs seem pretty easy, they get paid millions of dollars, travel all around the world, dress to the nines, look gorgeous all the time and have a close knit family.  It seems like they have it all right? Well… that is for you to decide. The reality of things is that even if they became famous for doing reality TV, everything that we see on the screen is not real at all.  Read this list and realize just whose life you would rather have. You might realize how amazing your life is and why you wouldn’t change it for the world.  advertising  14 They will never have a 'normal' life again  via:youtube.com  This family is so famous they will probably never have normal lives again. They are Michael Jackson famous, if anything they are harassed more than he was. They can't even leave their homes without needing to look flawless as the paparazzi are always waiting to catch their every move. Wouldn't you go crazy?  13 Their Beauty is Not As Real As It Seems  via:www.thekyliejenner.com  advertising  They make money out of their beauty, it is one of their most important assets, along with their bums. That is why it's no surprise that they have to invest millions of dollars in looking absolutely perfect every day.  It’s been reported by the Daily Mail that Kim Kardashian spends over $130,000 dollars a year on beauty treatments alone. With that amount of cash anyone would look flawless.  So next time you envy her beauty just think she pays a very high price tag to look that way.  12 Pressure to be Beautiful  Via: Youtube.com  Women around the world feel this constant pressure as well, but can you imagine how stressful it must be when your income depends on it and you have millions of eyes on you?  Kylie Jenner is one of the main examples of the pressure that can lead to an already beautiful girl to get a cosmetic procedure to look a certain way. She was not even 18 years old when she got her lips pumped to (I’m assuming) look like her older sisters, whose looks are reported as “beautiful” thanks to all of that cash they spend on it.  Pretty ironic isn’t it? That the older Kardashians negatively influenced their younger sibling into getting cosmetic procedures to looks like them.  11 Stolen Childhoods  via:www.yournextshoes.com  advertising  Kylie and Kendal have spent nearly half their lives recorded by the cameras for the world to see. They’ve had to deal with very personal issues and have cameras record their every reaction, limiting their privacy.  Teenage years are very difficult for most human beings; it is a difficult stage that involves a lot of changes and behavior that many of us wish to forget. These young girls have the entire world watching their every move, their lives, the failures and successes and it’s all being recorded for the world to remember.  The last years of their childhood was spent with other people around their house just recording everything, with their sisters putting on a show. Can you imagine what this can do to the mind of a child?  Kylie and Kendal don’t deserve our envy. They deserve our compassion.  10 The Kardashians Have Suffered Great Pain  via:www.dailymail.co.uk  They’re humans with lives that have not been all perfect and they still smile, laugh and go on. They seem so happy most of the time and that’s actually something nice to see given that they’ve also had to deal with very painful events in their lives.  Their marriages and relationships have been ridiculed, especially Kim's 72 hour marriage to Kris Humphries. Khloe has the whole world giving opinions on her marriage and Kourtney is dealing with a very public breakup.  9 They Have to Deal With a Lot of Humiliation  via:radaronline.com  advertising  To us the Kardashians might seem powerful; they are after all celebrities with millions of fans. Nevertheless in the celebrity world there are certain “categories”, do not be fooled by their millions of fans.  Within the Hollywood celebrity world the Kardashians are far away from being a part of the exclusive A list. They have actually been heavily criticize by BIG names in the entertainment industry like Jon Hamm, Daniel Craig, Michael Buble, Mariah Carey, Cher, Reese Witherspoon and even Barak and Michelle Obama.  They are considered too trashy, fame obsessed and foolish. Barack Obama doesn’t even like it when his daughters watch their show.  8 Their Fame is a Result of a Scandalous Sex Tape  via:darkhorsenews.com  It’s no surprise to anyone that the Kardashians/Jenners owe their fame to Kim’s scandalous sex tape. As Barbara Walter said in an interview with the Kardashians “You don’t act, you don’t sing, you don’t dance. You don’t have…. Forgive me, any talents”.  Their fame came mainly as a product of Kim’s sex tape and Kris Jenner’s excellent capacity for marketing it to their advantage. If it wasn’t for that, it’s very, extremely unlikely we would know their names today.  advertising  7 Kylie and Kendal Went Through their Dad’s Gender Transition  advertising  We all love Caitlin, there’s no doubt about that. The world felt proud when Bruce was brave enough to go through the public transition of becoming Caitlyn.  Nevertheless for Kylie and Kendal it was a pretty big emotional trauma. It was, after all, saying goodbye to their father Bruce and saying hello to Caitlyn.  Anyone in the world would find this emotionally difficult, and to make matters worse Kylie and Kendal had to go through it in the public eye. In several chapters of Keeping Up With The Kardashians you can easily notice a troubled Kylie finding it hard to come to terms to her father’s decision.  6 They Live Superficial Lifestyles  via:www.eonline.com  According to Psychology Today, leading a materialistic and superficial life style can enhance the probability of developing depression.  It is the lack of spiritual and emotional fulfillment that can help create mental health issues, especially when narcissism is involved in the formula.  As we can see the Kardashian/Jenners expose every detail of their lives. Not only on their reality T.V. show but also on their social media, perfectly yet falsely portraying themselves in their best snapshots. These symptoms are categorized as symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder, which can lead to emotional trauma.  5 They’re Self Obsessed  via:www.thedailybeast.com  advertising  What the world needs is more empathetic human beings who are concerned about the well being of others, not people who are only concerned about themselves.  The Kardashians have famously portrayed themselves as self obsessed with their millions of selfies, which have led their younger sisters, Kylie and Kendal to follow the same footpath.  Being self obsessed can actually cause health problems, just like His Holiness the Dalai Lama says: People who have the tendency to use more self-referential terms (I, me, myself) tend to have more health problems and earlier deaths. Being self-absorbed has an immediate effect of narrowing one’s focus and blurring one’s vision.”  4 Their Father is Known to Have Played Devil’s Advocate  Via: Mirror.co.uk  Everyone wants to admire their father for great qualities and for being a good person. Unfortunately for the Kardashians, their dad is known to have played devil’s advocate by famously defending O.J. Simpson in his murder trial after killing his wife Nicole Brown.  O.J. Simpson’s case became famous because the world was certain that he got away with murder, thanks to his magnificent attorney Robert Kardashian.  Yes, their father was a very successful lawyer, but one with values that leaves many wondering about his integrity.  3 Their Mother Has a Questionable History  via:www.dailymail.co.uk  advertising  Kris Jenner had an affair with Todd Waterman while still being married to Robert Kardashian. It has also been reported that she would leave her children at home while she enjoyed the good life.  It can't be pleasing to know that your mother cared more about her lover than her children. Rob Kardashian Jr. was just a baby when his mother would run off at night to have fun.  If this where not enough, in Robert Kardashian’s diary it was reported that Kris Jenner would beat up Kim Kardashian when she was a young teenager and she would also come home drunk.  2 They Fight A Lot  via:www.youtube.com  It’s normal to fight with your siblings. Nevertheless to anyone who has ever watched the show they’d be very accustomed to always seeing them fight. Even over the simplest and most foolish things of all, like when Kim fought with her mother over an apartment in New York.  Instead of feeling grateful and happy to have such a marvelous life style they focus on the little things to make a drama over anything. It kind of makes us wonder, are they even happy?  1 They Are Very Much Hated  via:www.youtube.com  advertising  The Kardashians are those people we all love to hate. They might have millions of followers and fans, but these people are probably smaller in quantity than the haters. It doesn’t take long to scroll down the comments section on stories about them and read many negative comments about them.  They’ve had to grow a very thick skin to put up with a lot of the criticism that gets thrown their way. They are not like other celebrities who tend to have more fans than haters. Kim Kardashian in particular has appeared in several lists as one of the most hated people in the entertainment industry.  Ouch! No one would like to be on that list.

"The publication's explosive report claims Justin was spotted riding his motorbike around New York City without his wife.  An insider close to the couple told the publication, 'He's the happiest man in Manhattan, while Jen chooses to stay primarily in sunny LA.'  'It's a long distance marriage,' they add.  Getty  Life & Style reports that the days leading up to Jen's 49th birthday on February 11 was when the couple's relationship came crumbling down.  The publication claims to have exclusively learned that Jen feared Justin intended to break up with her on her big day, with a source revealing: 'He'd arranged to throw Jen a small, intimate party and hang around for a few days before heading right back to New York.  'And Jen thought he had plans to quietly file for divorce soon as he returned.'  The insider continues, 'As time drags on, Justin seems to view his visits with Jen as obligatory, and he's just been going through the motions.'  'The marriage is all but over.'  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux step out looking tense in New York City Getty  Life & Style's sensational report reveals that the whole situation is far too familiar for Jen.  After a New Year's getaway in 2005 to Anguilla with Brad Pitt and several friends, Jen and her then husband announced their separation.  In public Jen and Justin have always put on a solid front, but Life & Style's bombshell report reveals that Justin is 'tired' of the facade.  'He seems like he's tired of carrying on the facade of a happy marriage,' a friend close to the star told Life & Style. 'Knowing Justin, I think he feels it's best to make it an official split. He will always love Jen, but deep down he seems to believe they'd be better off as friends.'  The couple have yet to respond to Life & Style's allegations."
he says this theory of infection explains some things that doctors have been trying to puzzle out. for example certain conditions like high blood pressure diabetes and heart disease stress the endothelium. its no surprise then that people who have these conditions are also the ones who get the sickest when they catch covid-19. it also helps to explain why patients have such low oxygen in their blood but their lungs may not be as stiff as they typically are in patients who have respirato. 
"Justin Bieber became engaged to Hailey Baldwin over the weekend.  But the news doesn't seem to be upsetting his ex Selena Gomez, who he was dating on and off from 2011 until earlier this year.  On Sunday the 25-year-old Wolves singer was spotted with a handsome young man who looks a bit like a Beckham. He was by her side as they boarded a yacht named Justine to visit Coney Island in New York in style.  Back with this one: Selena Gomez was seen with a cute mystery man when she went to Coney Island in New York on Sunday  They were so close: The man followed the Love You Like A Love Sing songbird  He's got the look: The man looks a bit like a Beckham and was dressed down for the day at sea; she wore a pair of black leather sandals by Tod's  The mystery man had on a black shirt with blue shorts and worn-in sneakers with Puma socks.  And Gomez was chic in a white crop top, rust colored drawstring slacks and thick soled black leather sandals by Tod's for SS18. Black thin sunglasses looked on trend.  The Good For You singer also carried a notepad and a glass of red iced tea.  There they are two months ago: The siren was also seen with this same man in May when they were at a Taylor Swift concert at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California  It's interesting that she boarded a boat named Justine which is eerily close to the first name of her most famous ex.  But it is likely the boat was booked by her assistant and the pop star never even noticed the name.  She was joined by several pals as she embarked on the day cruise around New York.  Chic chick: Gomez was chic in a white crop top, rust colored drawstring slacks  Details: Black thin sunglasses looked on trend. The Good For You singer also carried a notepad and a glass of red iced tea  Coney Island is a peninsular residential neighborhood, beach, and leisure/entertainment destination of Long Island on the Coney Island Channel.  It is in the Lower Bay in the southwestern part of the borough of Brooklyn in New York City.  Selena often splits her time between New York City and Los Angeles.  Gomez has been in relationships with The Weeknd (2016 - 2017), Zedd (producer) (2015), Bieber (2010 - 2018), Taylor Lautner (2009) and Nick Jonas (2008 - 2010).  All aboard... the love boat? The fellow followed her up the stairs as they were greeted by a crew member  New do? Gomez appeared to have some shorter hair on the back of her neck. The rest of her locks were piled into a messy updo for a casual look  If Gomez is upset that Bieber may marry Baldwin - who he dated years ago after a split from the brunette Texas native - she was not showing it.  She was also seen on a boat in a bikini in an image shared by her assistant Theresa Marie Mingus.  In a snapshot Theresa posted to Instagram, bikini-clad Selena beamed and stuck her tongue out while lounging on a deck chair near the stern of the vessel.  She can't get away from Justin? It's interesting that she boarded a boat named Justine which is eerily close to the first name of her most famous ex. But it is likely the boat was booked by her assistant and the pop star never even noticed the name  Shipping off: The Back To You crooner quickly slipped into a two piece bathing suit  Not the Bahamas, but oh well: The location was New York City, but it still looked like the group had a fun time  Theresa, also wearing a bikini, captioned gleefully that her boss was her: 'bestfriendddddd'.  In video footage tweeted by one of Selena's fan accounts, a claque of both male and female friends could be seen accompanying her on her boat ride.  After she split from The Weeknd, former teenage sweethearts Justin and Selena reportedly went on again late last year - but by this March, they were on a break.  Selena's mother Mandy Teefey told Gossip Cop in January she was 'not happy' her daughter had taken up with her used-to-be.  What engagement? She was also seen in this blue bikini as she sat on deck of the yacht; the image was shared by her assistant Theresa Marie Mingus  Having a ball: In a snapshot Theresa posted to Instagram , bikini-clad 25-year-old Selena beamed and stuck her tongue out while lounging on a deck chair near the stern of the vessel  A place in the sun: In video footage tweeted by one of Selena's fan accounts, a claque of both male and female friends could be seen accompanying her on her boat ride  They purportedly first started dating in 2010 before going red carpet official at the following year's Vanity Fair Oscar Party.  'Jelena' are said to have split up late in 2012 - only for a rash of unconfirmed reconciliation rumors to flare up around them for a bit in 2013.  That July, however, Selena explained in an interview with the Associated Press: 'I've known him for a really long time and we enjoy each other's company every now and then. But I'm definitely single and enjoying being that.'  Justin is claimed to have proposed to Hailey in a restaurant at the Bahamian resort where he was staying this weekend, a brace of eyewitnesses gossiped to TMZ.  Out in the open: She and Justin Bieber purportedly first started dating in 2010 before going red carpet official at the following year's Vanity Fair Oscar Party (pictured)  Before he popped the question, his security detail allegedly instructed the other restaurant-goers to tuck away their cellphones.  That afternoon, Justin's mother Pattie Mallette had effervesced on her Twitter account: 'Love Love Love Love Love Love Love.'  Justin and Hailey had a brief dalliance in 2016, but Hailey spoke to E! News that February and qualified that 'We are not an exclusive couple.'  After his latest split from Selena, Justin and Hailey have been back on over the past few weeks and have been unafraid to publicly display their affection.  On Sunday, Justin's father Jeremy posted a sunset snapshot of his son and wrote: '@justinbieber Proud is an understatement! Excited for the next chapter!'  Meanwhile, Hailey's born-again Christian father Stephen Baldwin, one of the less famous actor brothers of Alec Baldwin, tweeted a Bible verse that same day.  Together again: Justin and Hailey Baldwin, with whom he had a brief non-exclusive dalliance in 2016, reportedly got engaged on Saturday at a Bahamian resort  Beginning with '#Blessed,' he went on to quote Gospel: 'John 1:14 14 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth'.  Hailey held forth about her own religious convictions in Elle UK last year, saying: 'It's something I plan to stick to for the rest of my life – raise my kids that way, marry someone who believes in the same things. It's important to me.'  Meanwhile, Justin, who in 2014 was arrested in Miami on charges including driving his Lamborghini under the influence, is a famous congregant of the Sydney-born megachurch Hillsong and something of a religious protégé to its pastor Carl Lentz."

"The producers of BBC drama Ordeal by Innocence have explained the decision to recast and reshoot the Agatha Christie adaptation following sexual assault allegations made against original actor Ed Westwick.  Advertisement  Ordeal by Innocence was dropped from the BBC Christmas schedules after allegations of sexual assault were made against actor Westwick in November last year. Westwick strenuously denies the allegations.  Producers Mammoth Screen decided to reshoot parts of the series with another actor, 30-year-old English star Christian Cooke. Now director Sandra Goldbacher and producer Damien Timmer have explained in a new interview with Radio Times why the decision was made.  “Hundreds and hundreds of people’s work would have just gone,” director Goldbacher says in the new issue of Radio Times, “or been indefinitely delayed. Which would have been devastating for everyone.”  Goldbacher adds that she was encouraged by the example of director Ridley Scott, who recast and reshot Hollywood movie All the Money in the World with Christopher Plummer following allegations made against original star Kevin Spacey.  “I felt encouraged by Ridley Scott having done it. It was like a sort of talisman for us all: he’s done it, so we can do it,” she said.  A trailer for the re-worked BBC series was recently released, including Cooke as character Mickey Argyll.  Goldbacher and producer Damian Timmer explain in the new issue how they were able to bring the original cast and locations back for the re-shoots, despite the late notice and time constraints.  While original filming took place in the summer, the re-shoots were conducted in winter. As a consequence, Timmer explains, “the technical challenges were reversed. This time, we had the snow, not the sun.”  Both Ordeal by Innocence and All the Money in the World were re-cast in order for the production to go ahead. However, other projects including Netflix biopic Gore starring Spacey were shelved.  Timmer says in the interview that the experience of Ordeal by Innocence shows that the television and film industry is able to adapt to meet specific challenges.  “Every era throws up new challenges that impact on filming. You might always have shot a series in a location that suddenly becomes a terrorist zone. The industry adapts and finds ways of working around whatever the issues is at the time.”  Ordeal by Innocence will now be shown on BBC1 this Easter.

"CLOSE Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's tribe may be growing, according to reports on Wednesday that the celebrity couple have hired a surrogate to carry their third child. USA TODAY  Kim Kardashian at the 2017 Forbes Women's Summit on June 13, 2017, in New York. (Photo: Angela Weiss, AFP/Getty Images)  Soon, there could be another little Kardashian-West to coo over.  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, already the parents of two (North, 4, and Saint, 18 months) and longing for a third, have hired a surrogate to help make it happen, because Kardashian's doctors strongly advised her not to go through a third pregnancy.  According to People and E! Online, unnamed sources in the know say the couple paid a surrogacy agency nearly $70,000 to find a surrogate, who will be paid about $45,000 for 10 months of carrying a pregnancy, with a bonus of $5,000 for each possible twin or triplet child.  This news broke Wednesday, the same day Kardashian's first makeup line, KKW Beauty, launched and then promptly sold out of her Crème Contour & Highlight Kit.  All of the Contour & Highlight Kits have sold out!!! — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) June 21, 2017  If you've been keeping up with Keeping Up With the Kardashians, you already know Kim was considering surrogacy because she's talked about it on the show. She wanted a third baby anyway, and her yen grew only stronger in the wake of her traumatic experience as the victim of an armed robbery in Paris last October.  ""I've come to the conclusion that I can't carry another one,"" Kardashian told her mother, Kris Jenner, on the show. ""So now I want to explore surrogacy.""  A third pregnancy was not in the cards for Kardashian: She suffered from placenta accreta in her first pregnancy, a painful and potentially life-threatening condition that makes giving birth difficult because the placenta is attached too deeply to the uterine wall.  Kardashian detailed on her blog how her doctor had to insert his arm inside her to scrape the placenta from her womb after delivering her first baby.  ""How disgusting and painful!!! My mom was crying; she had never seen anything like this before,"" she wrote. ""It was the most painful experience of my life!""  Kardashian's recent discussions on the show about her desire for another baby have also involved her sister, Khloé, who offered to act as a surrogate until they went to a fertility specialist who found Khloe has fertility problems of her own.  Chrissy Teigen also offered to act as Kim's surrogate, telling Access Hollywood that she would do it in ""a heartbeat.""  “I really enjoyed the pregnancy process,"" said Teigen, 30, and a new mom herself.

That is because the consistent Vegas shows allow Stefani, 48, to live the rest of her life. “As a mom, if you look at my touring for the last ten years, I haven’t really toured,” she told journalist Allison Kugel. “I toured for seven years and it’s hard with the kids because they’re in school and I’m not homeschooling, and you can’t pull them out. It’s not fair to them.  “I did my last tour because I had this unexpected life crisis and then the music came pouring out of me from that,” Stefani explained. “It was such a lifesaver and a beautiful moment for me to be able to write again. I put that tour on at the last minute and went on a summer tour with the kids. It was so much fun for them, they loved it.

RELATED: Gwen Stefani Reveals Fun Fact About Blake Shelton’s Ex-Girlfriend  “I’m obviously at the end of my journey of being a musician… because of my age, and I’ve been doing it for thirty-something years,” she said. “It’s perfect for me to be able to do a Vegas show because not only does it work for me as a mom, but it also works creatively.  “It’s going to be a way to express myself and do my whole catalogue of the music that defines every time period in my life; all the crises and all the joys.”  Stefani also dished on the artists that inspire and make her better. Two such names are Jennifer Lopez and Stefani’s boyfriend Blake Shelton.  “I’ve always looked up to her [Lopez] in the sense that we’re exactly the same age and I remember when No Doubt was first coming out and she hadn’t done ‘Jenny from The Block’ yet, but she had that song out, ‘Waiting for Tonight’,” Stefani recalled. “At the time I was working with Prince and he started comparing me and Jennifer.  “I didn’t even see how I was in the same category with her,” she revealed. “She was Jennifer Lopez and I was in a band called No Doubt (laughs). But now here we are both doing these residencies all these years later, and we’ve known each other through the years. She’s always invited me to her kids’ birthday parties and things like that. She is a crazy work[horse].”  Speaking of JLo’s Vegas residency, Stefani paid close attention to how the “On The Floor” singer crafted her shows.  “I was studying the production of her show. The show was incredible, and she works so hard on stage,” explained Stefani. “When I came backstage to talk to her afterwards, she comes out of the dressing room looking like a Barbie doll. She was breathtaking on stage, but when you see her up close, it’s like, ‘What?! It’s not possible. You are so gorgeous!'”  RELATED: Blake Shelton Admits He ‘Thinks About’ Marrying Gwen Stefani  When practising a performance or putting pen to paper, it helps to have a veteran singer-songwriter on standby. Fortunately for Stefani, her country crooning beau is just that.  “Obviously, he’s my best friend, so I’m bouncing stuff off him all the time,” she said of Shelton. “He’s one of those people in my life that’s super supportive and gets me motivated. There’s a whole bunch of songs about him in the show, so that’s fun.  “Like anybody with their best friend, we share everything together. I’ll tell him, ‘I picked my dancers! There were 500 girls that tried out!’ and I’ll send him videos.”  Gwen Stefani’s upcoming Las Vegas residency, Just a Girl, begins June 27 at the Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino."
"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will be tying the knot at St. George's Chapel this spring, and each and every week, ET will be breaking down all the latest updates as they gear up for their May 19 nuptials.  BIGGEST NEWS OF THE WEEK  Fans have eagerly been waiting to hear which celebrities scored an invite to what's sure to be the biggest event of the year, and this week, we learned that one of Meghan's closest pals, Priyanka Chopra, will for sure be in attendance. ""Yes I'm going,"" the Quantico star confirmed during her guest appearance on Live With Kelly and Ryan on Thursday. ""But that's all.""  Chopra told People, however, that she is ""not a bridesmaid,"" despite all the speculation in recent months that she would be in the bridal party.  As for the groom, Prince Harry has finally picked his Best Man, and, unsurprisingly, it's Prince William! The Duke of Cambridge joked earlier this year that he was expecting to fulfill the role, but his brother had yet to ask him. We're happy to report that Harry made it official on Thursday.  ""The Duke of Cambridge is honored to have been asked, and is very much looking forward to supporting his brother at St. George’s Chapel,"" Kensington Palace shared in a statement.  Meanwhile, Meghan has been busy wrapping up all the last minute details ahead of her and Harry's nuptials. A source told ET on Tuesday that Amal Clooney's go-to hairdresser in London, Miguel Perez, is expected to style Meghan's tresses on her big day. He's currently a stylist at Salon Sloane, whose world-leading hairstylists have worked on everyone from Lindsay Lohan to the Victoria's Secret Angels.  ""Yes, I do Meghan's hair,"" Miguel reportedly told The Mail this week. ""I do Amal's, and Meghan is friends with her. I also do George [Clooney]'s, I do the whole family. Amal put Meghan and me together when she moved here [to London]. I do her color, her cut and her styling.""  ""We have talked about it [the wedding] and we have a plan,"" he continued. ""I can't say any more, but we know what we're doing.""  Meghan and Harry also chose the music for their wedding service this week, and it will include a full orchestra. St. George's Chapel's Director of Music, James Vivian, will direct the music, which features a selection of choral groups, soloists and musicians, Kensington Palace revealed on Tuesday.  WEDDING COUNTDOWN  So, how many days until the royal wedding? Meghan and Harry will officially be saying ""I do"" in:  Getty Images  OUT AND ABOUT  The lovebirds took a brief break from wedding planning early Wednesday morning to represent the royal family at the Anzac Day Service in London, England.  Anzac Day is a day of remembrance for soldiers from Australia and New Zealand who've served and died in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations. Both countries are a part of the Commonwealth, of which Queen Elizabeth II serves as leader.  Getty Images  ROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP  As we anxiously wait to see what Meghan's wedding dresses will look like, there's also talks about what tiara she will be gifted with. There's a good chance that the bride-to-be will debut a brand-new tiara as she walks down the aisle, royal jewelry expert Ella Kay of the blog The Court Jeweler told Good Housekeeping earlier this week.  ""The younger son's wife getting a new tiara would be the precedent,"" she explained. ""Prince Charles might buy her a tiara.""  Previous royal brides like Sarah, Duchess of York, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, received major bling on their wedding day. But, the circumstances are different for Kate Middleton, who wore the Cartier Halo tiara for her wedding, since she will eventually become queen, and will ""borrow"" tiaras in the meantime.  ""Usually what happens is you get allotted your tiaras,"" Kay explained. ""Like Camilla [Duchess of Cornwall] has three, but they're all technically loaners that not anyone else wears.""  RATHER REGAL LOOKS  Getty Images  Meghan outdid herself with not one, but two regal looks in one day.  While stepping out to the Anzac Day service, the 36-year-old brunette beauty donned an elegant gray Smythe coat with a black dress underneath, Sarah Flint Jay heels, a Gucci Dionysus bag, a red poppy pin and a statement wide-brimmed, floppy hat. This type of hat is much simpler than the fancy fascinators and pillbox hats we typically see on royals like Queen Elizabeth II and the Duchess of Cambridge, but we love that Meghan put her own unique spin on the trend.  For her second look of the day, Meghan opted for a more formal ensemble. The bride-to-be arrived to Westminster Abbey in a black beret embellished with a dragonfly from milliner Philip Treacy, which she pulled off perfectly by pairing it with a midi-length Emilia Wickstead dress suit and a Jimmy Choo box clutch.  SERVIN' UP SUITS  USA Network  Sadly, this section of our weekly royals countdown ends this week, as Meghan appeared in her very last episode of Suits on Wednesday.  In case you missed it, we recapped the full finale (HERE).  You had a good run, Rachel Zane.  SPARKLE LIKE MARKLE  Earlier this week, ET caught up with one of Meghan's former makeup artists, Spencer Barnes, who opened up about her evolving beauty looks and how when he was still doing her makeup, Meghan always requested a natural look.  ""She loves beautiful skin, to start with, and she has the most gorgeous complexion,"" Barnes mused. ""It's that soft, caramel. Her mixed heritage makes her an exotic beauty of beauties. Her chocolate eyes, the way her eyes light up when she smiles, I love her smile, her teeth and her lips. And then her perfect brows.""  ""Whenever I'd work with her, she'd like to highlight her fresh, radiant skin,"" he continued. ""We'd do a very glowing, fresh-faced skin. We'd use earthy tones, colors that enhanced her natural beauty, rather than a lot of obvious color choices, like purple, green or blue. We'd stick with earthy tones -- peaches, golds, browns -- a lot of rich, warm tones and that really flattered her. It helped her just look radiant and fresh.""

"They famously coined the phrase 'conscious uncoupling' when they announced the end of their 11-year marriage in 2014.  But even though they're no longer husband and wife, it seems friendly exes Gwyneth Paltrow, 44, and Chris Martin, 40, remain the best of friends.  Sharing a photo on her Instagram page, the actress and her former spouse joined forces for a day out with daughter Apple, 13, and son Moses, 11, at the Museum Of Ice Cream in Los Angeles on Sunday.  Scroll down for video  Family affair: Friendly exes Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin enjoyed a day out with daughter Apple, 13, and son Moses, 11, at the Museum Of Ice Cream in Los Angeles on Sunday  Celebrating both Apple's birthday and Mother's Day, the family looked as though they were having a blast on their day out at the museum, billed as a 'place where flavours are mysteries and toppings are toys'.  The Coldplay frontman looked to be enjoying the company of daughter Apple and son Moses along with beaming ex-wife Gwyneth.  The youngster was bearing a remarkable similarity to her actress mother, proving the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.  Alongside the snap, Gwyneth wrote: 'Best Apple's birthday/Mother's Day EVER at the @museumoficecream @autumncomm SO FUN #goopgo #dtla.'  Mini me: The family were celebrating celebrating both Apple's birthday and Mother's Day as they enjoyed their day out at the museum  Apple was pictured in a pink hoodie with leopard print leggings and UGG boots.  Moses donned an equally sporty look with a darker pink hoodie with navy and black tracksuit bottoms and black Jeezy trainers.  Chris looked laid back in black skinny jeans and a vintage white t-shirt.  He rocked up the look with a blue G-Shock watch and blue and white Air Jordan trainers.  Fashionista Gwyneth looked chic in a floral maxi skirt and fitted black vest.  In 2014, Gwyneth told readers of her website of her impending divorce after 11 years of marriage.  Divorce: Gwyneth and Chris broke the news of their marital split in March 2014 writing 'it is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate'  Gwyneth and Chris broke the news of their marital split in March 2014, writing: 'It is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate.'  They went on to explain that the split had been on the cards for 'well over a year' and that in many ways they were closer than ever.  She described the process as 'conscious uncoupling'.  'We have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and co-parent, we will be able to continue in the same manner,' the statement continued.  But since the couple's heartbreaking split it appears the family unit is stronger than ever.  Happy together: Since the couple's heartbreaking split in March 2014 after 11 years of marriage it appears the family unit is stronger than ever  According to the teachings of conscious uncoupling, humans simply aren't meant to stay married for so long.  They point toward the exponential increase in lifespan that humans have experienced in the last century or so: 'We’re living three lifetimes compared to early humans, perhaps we need to redefine the construct.  'Social research suggests that because we’re living so long, most people will have two or three significant long-term relationships in their lifetime.  'Our biology and psychology aren’t set up to be with one person for four, five, or six decades.'  Gwyneth has since moved on with Glee co-creator Brad Falchuk, 46, who she's been dating since 2014.  Chris has been dating actress Annabelle Wallis, 32, for the past 18 months, and enjoyed a brief romance with Hollywood leading lady Jennifer Lawrence, 26, in the summer of 2015."
"Doin’ what is best for her. Selena Gomez believes she has made the right decision when it comes to on-again, off-again boyfriend Justin Bieber — by choosing not to be with him.  “Selena started seeing the bigger picture when it came to their relationship, like what was more important: her general happiness and her family and friends approval, or her being together with Justin, where no one really supported their relationship,” a source exclusively tells Us Weekly.  “She obviously chose happiness and her friends and family and is so thrilled about her decision-making process,” the source continued before adding, “She feels more empowered than ever and is looking forward to this next chapter.”  Sharing the same sentiment, another insider tells Us that the “Wolves” singer, who was the one who broke it off with Bieber, feels like “she got it out of her system.” Helping things is the fact that Gomez, 25, has other exciting things to focus on, like her new single “Back 2 You” which will be released on Thursday, May 10 — a song that many are speculating to have been inspired by Bieber.  Us Weekly exclusively revealed that the former flames, who dated from 2011 to 2014, were officially back together after they were spotted reuniting in October 2017. Their rekindled romance saw the pair going to church, enjoying candle-lit dinners and embarking on romantic getaways together, including a trip to Jamaica in February, when the pair attended Bieber’s father’s wedding.  Despite trying to make their revamped relationship work, one person was not convinced that it was a good idea: Gomez’s mother, Mandy Teefey, who reportedly disagreed with her daughter over her decision to give Bieber another chance despite their past tumultuous relationship. In March, Us Weekly announced that the pair were “taking a break” because of Teefy’s unwavering disapproval of the “Baby” crooner. Since putting their relationship on pause, Bieber, 24, has been spotted spending time with Baskin Champion.

"Ed Sheeran revealed why Beyoncé has not been answering your emails: He says the ""Lemonade"" singer changes her email address every week.  On Friday, while at Jingle Ball in Inglewood, California, Sheeran told ET how he pulled off recording his new single, ""Perfect Duet,"" with Beyoncé.  ""I have an email address I email [to get in touch with Beyoncé],"" he said. Then he pointed out that Beyoncé's email address ""actually changes every week.""  Sheeran said he reached out to her via email and started working on the song in May, but it took a few months to finish the track, which finally dropped on Thursday.  ""Obviously she had twins [in June], and we finished [the song] in September, so I've been holding onto it since then,"" he said of the ""Perfect"" remix.  Speaking of ""Perfect,"" Sheeran added that Beyoncé only needed one take to record the song. Sheeran also said Beyoncé had some notes for him.  ""The original version of 'Perfect' was just an acoustic guitar,"" before more instruments were added, he explained. ""[Beyoncé] rung me up and was like, 'I don't know how you feel about this but I've taken all the instruments off it and it's just gonna be acoustic guitar,' and I was like, 'Ah that's great, because it used to be that!'""  ""Then when we got in together, it wasn't so much notes, it was very much like a back-and-forth thing, like, 'What'd you think of this?' Or, 'What do you think of this?' And [we were] probably in the studio for four hours.""  Once Beyoncé began recording, it was smooth sailing.  ""She was just like, 'Right!' Went in, one take, came out, like, 'Yeah, that sounds all right!'"" said Sheeran. See more of Sheeran's interview on ET."
"The Bachelor's Lauren Bushnell split with beau Devin Antin after a year of dating.  The 28-year-old reality star began dating Devin in July of 2017, two months after ending her relationship with fiance Ben Higgins, whom she met on season 20 of The Bachelor.  Lauren and Devin met on Tinder and struck up a friendship before she competed on the ABC reality dating game show.  Splits: The Bachelor's Lauren Bushnell split with beau Devin Antin after a year of dating; (pictured March)  'I don’t think I’ve shared before but I only met up with one person from the app and it was him,' the beauty wrote during an Instagram Q&A with fans in October 2017.  'We hung out for a while but more as friends but always got along really well.  'Fast forward two years later when I moved back to L.A. we hung out to catch up and things just kinda happened after that.' she explained.  The former flight attendant also said that her last relationship with Higgins made her more aware of walking down the aisle.  Beginnings: Lauren and Devin had met on Tinder and struck up a friendship before she competed on the ABC reality dating game show; (pictured August)  She told the fan: 'I’ve learned a lot of things in the last couple years and this is a big one. Marriage is such a special and sacred thing that should never be rushed.'  When asked if she planned on marrying Antin, the star gushed.  'I do see a future with him,' she said.  'But I want to be 1000 percent sure before I get engaged and even more sure before I get married. And for me that takes time.'  Time was not on Antin's side as the two have now gone separate ways.  'I’ve always been someone who maybe jumps into things a little too quickly and I fall really fast,' she told UsWeekly on August 6.  'And I always had this idea that I was going to be married by this age, kids, and this was going to be my plan … and now, I mean I’m almost 29 but I don’t really have a timestamp on anything anymore, which is nice.'"
"Less than one week after kicking out White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and continuing to harass her family, “Red Hen” owner Stephanie Wilkinson finally received a bitter taste of her own intolerant medicine.When conservatives encounter someone with whom they disagree, they try to engage in meaningful debate. With liberals, there is only resistance. Instead of inviting civil discourse, leftist ideologues are resorting to suppression, harassment, and even physical violence in response to “problematic” ideas. Of course, they’re quickly discovering that their juvenile and fascist actions have consequences.On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her extended family members, many of whom are liberals, were forced out of the Red Hen eatery in Lexington, Virginia, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson. Although the party politely obliged the indignant staffers, Wilkinson proceeded to gather her comrades and stalk Sanders’ family at another restaurant, screaming insults and demanding they leave. Now that word of her behavior is national news, Wilkinson is being forced to live by her own principles.Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson has not only been forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington, according to Fox News, she’s also placed herself in the center of what could turn into a massive lawsuit for damages concerning the effect her discrimination against Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had on Red Hen establishments across the country. Along with her resignation from the organization, Wilkinson’s bigotry has caused unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the U.S. to suffer protests, negative reviews, and boycotts, CBS News reports.Main Street Lexington president Elizabeth Outland Branner offered a short response in reference to Wilkinson’s resignation, which is undoubtedly a move toward damage control for the group, which represents many local businesses.“Considering the events of the past weekend, Stephanie felt it best that for the continued success of Main Street Lexington, she should step aside,” Branner wrote in an email.Wilkinson has caused such severe damage to other like-named establishments that business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings.More than 4,300 replied, including multiple tweets calling on the restaurant to condone Sanders and the Trump administration’s actions. The Red Hen answered the threats by defining “unaffiliated” as well as an explanation that it is illegal for businesses in the District of Columbia to discriminate against people because of their political views.Another Red Hen restaurant, this one in Swedesboro, New Jersey, also faced a slew of angry calls and social media posts for refusing to serve a woman who’d never stepped through their door.“Kindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent victim on Facebook,” said a post on the family-owned restaurant’s Facebook page.The manager of a New Jersey-based restaurant with the same name lamented that their location’s rating has plummetted from “4.8 stars to three-point-something.” An owner in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent this same damage by adding a pop-up box stating that their restaurant has “absolutely no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant anywhere else.”Wilkinson has defended her discriminatory actions, ironically claiming that she doesn’t enjoy “confrontation” but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members.“I’m not a huge fan of confrontation,” Wilkinson told The Post. “I have a business, and I want the business to thrive.” But, she went on to say, “This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.”When the mainstream media propagates that those with certain political views are “Nazis,” they incite hatred and violence in those prone to carry out such extremist beliefs. If conservatives are indeed Nazis, progressives have a moral obligation to not only oppose them but physically stop them.However, conservatives are not Nazis. In fact, the right has consistently stood up for the liberties of all, including far-leftists, to express their beliefs in a peaceful and unhindered manner. Such is the opposite of Nazism. In fact, it is those screaming “Nazi!” who are acting as the new Third Reich, shouting ideological chants, forcing out those with whom they disagree, discriminating against certain demographics, attempting to take away our Constitutional rights, and inciting physical violence.Stephanie Wilkinson is getting exactly what she has demanded — a backlash from the political opposition. Turnabout is fair play. While conservatives aren’t going to wield the government as a weapon to force intolerant ideologues like her to serve those they don’t want to serve, as the left does, they’re learning that injecting their political views into their non-political professions might not be the best business decision."

"It’s been three years since Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick parted ways — but no matter how much time passes, he will always be considered a part of her family.  After nine years together, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star and Disick split in July 2015. Since their breakup, both have found love with someone new: Kardashian, 39, with boyfriend Younes Bendjima and Disick, 35, with girlfriend Sofia Richie.  Though Kardashian and Disick are no longer romantically linked, they continue to co-parent their three children: sons Mason Dash, 8½, and Reign Aston, 3½, and daughter Penelope, 6.  “I think Scott will always be family, and so we really try to have a good relationship for the kids,” Kardashian told PEOPLE about Disick while promoting the new season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  Kourtney Kardashian/Instagram  She also revealed that KUWTK audiences will catch a glimpse of how their relationships with their significant others has impacted their co-parenting rhythm.  “I think you’ll see that on the season a bit, but you know we really do our best to make the kids the priority,” she said.  In addition to appearing on KUWTK, Disick will soon be starring in his own E! reality show about his hobby of flipping home.  “It will probably come out next year, and it’s basically about me doing things that I’m interested in, which is buying and selling properties,” he told PEOPLE last weekend.  And as he embarks on this new endeavor, Kardashian will be cheering him on from the sidelines.  “I’m excited! I think that he’s great at that; it’s always been a passion of his,” she said. “He puts his own spin on the houses, so I think it’s amazing. I can’t wait to see it.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kourtney Kardashian ‘Trusts’ Sofia Richie with Her and Scott Disick’s Kids: Source  With the season 15 premiere episode just days away, Kardashian also hinted that there will be lots of drama in store for viewers.  “I think this was probably our craziest fight that we’ve ever had,” she shared about an explosive moment between her and sister Kim Kardashian West.  She explained, “I think I’ve always been the sister who like I would just tell them like it is or if they said something to me, I’d just break them right down the fastest and make them upset and now I’ve been working on being more in touch with my feelings. I think I just couldn’t take it anymore. I just felt like we needed to make a change and not be so critical.”  “We’ve always been a family who will do anything for each other and we know that at the end of the day, but sometimes there’s criticism and I felt not good hanging out with them everyday and I couldn’t take it anymore,” said Kardashian. “So you’ll see in the season how it plays out.”  Season 15 of Keeping Up with the Kardashians premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on E!"
"Kelly Dodd isn’t calling a truce with Meghan King Edmonds any time soon!  The RHOC stars have been at odds since Edmonds, 32, asked Dodd, 41, if it was true that she was cheating on Michael with her boyfriend — and Dodd responded by telling Edmonds that her husband Jim was having an affair while she was pregnant.  Dodd carried their feud over to her Bravo blog, where she commented on her costars’ marriages — and took a stab at the Edmonds’ relationship!  “How great are our guys?” she wrote before talking about Diko and Peggy Sulahian and Doug and Lydia McLaughlin.  “Michael too supports my decision to get a breast reduction, even though he thinks my boobs are ‘perfect,’” she continued. “He respects that it is my body and whatever makes me happy is his priority. Michael has always been there with me at every medical procedure. For example, when we were going through IVF, he attended every doctor visit, administered all of my shots, he was present when the embryos were implanted, as well as attending all my prenatal care appointments. Not all of our husbands are so supportive, right Meghan?”  Radar previously reported that Edmonds was forced to undergo her IVF treatments alone, as her husband was on the road for his baseball hosting gig. She later confessed that he was a distant dad who was “removed” from her pregnancy and insiders told Radar he was “pulling away” as well.  The former baseball pro even missed their daughter Aspen’s conception and his wife’s baby shower.  Edmonds also claimed via Twitter that Dodd made hurtful claims about her postpartum depression, but the comments have since been removed.

"Nicholas Brendon has been arrested once again.  The former Buffy the Vampire Slayer star was taken into custody in Palm Springs, California, on Oct. 11, as the result of an alleged domestic dispute between the actor and an unnamed woman, who is believed to be his girlfriend.  Brendon -- who played Xander Harris on the popular teen dramedy vampire series from 1997 to 2003 -- was arrested on charges of domestic violence and violating a protective order.  Sgt. William Hutchinson of the Palm Springs Police Department tells ET that the incident in question happened around 9 p.m. at the Saguaro Hotel.  Palm Springs Police Department via Getty Images  PHOTOS: Busted! Hollywood's Most Memorable Mugshots  The 46-year-old actor -- who has had numerous run-ins with the law in the past, including four arrests in 2015 -- allegedly pulled the woman's arm and then her hair after getting into an argument.  Police tell ET that the woman has two other protective orders against Brendon in both New York and Florida. The order allows Brendon to be near the woman, but prohibits him from threatening, harassing, injuring or assaulting her.  Brendon was released from custody on Oct. 12 on a $50,000 bail bond, according to booking records. He is scheduled to appear in court on Nov. 28.  ET reached out to Brendon's rep, who had no comment.  NEWS: Nicholas Brendon Pleads Guilty To Misdemeanor Criminal Mischief, Choking Charges Dropped  In December 2015, the actor plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief at the Saratoga Springs City Court in New York after allegedly choking his girlfriend in a hotel room three months earlier.  The judge reportedly ruled that Brendon, -- who has long struggled with substance abuse and depression -- would not serve jail time pending completion of drug and alcohol counseling and avoiding trouble with the law for a year.

"“FACT: Donald Trump would force schools to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in office.”— Hillary Clinton campaign post on Twitter, May 14, 2016One of the nine things the Clinton campaign says “every voter in America needs to know about Donald Trump” is that he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office. Most of the nine items are Trump’s widely-known ideas (Muslim ban, torture, ISIS, etc.), but his proposal to allow guns in schools is less familiar to the public.That’s largely because Trump himself hasn’t talked about it much publicly. His campaign, as usual, didn’t respond to our request for more information, and doesn’t seem to have answered other media outlets’ requests, either.Perhaps Trump is saving the details until his May 20 speech at the National Rifle Association leadership event. (The NRA wants to repeal gun-free zones.) In the meantime, we took a look at the few instances he’s described his plan to see what he intends to do about school gun-free zones.The FactsCongress enacted the Gun-Free School Zones Act in 1990, under President George H. W. Bush, as a part of a larger crime bill, in response to school shootings in the 1980s. It was struck down by the Supreme Court because of violations under the Commerce Clause but was reenacted under President Bill Clinton with a list of exceptions supported by the NRA.The law makes it illegal under federal law for people to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone, but states can decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Most states prohibit concealed carry. There is a dispute between gun-rights and gun-control advocates as to whether the law enacted to prevent shootings on school grounds actually motivates people to target schools, since the victims would be unarmed. (We plan to explore this in a future fact-check.)After the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, states began introducing legislation to arm teachers and staff at K-12 schools. In 2013 alone, at least 33 states introduced more than 80 bills to authorize school districts to allow certain teachers and staff to carry concealed firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2013, more states have considered laws allowing guns on college campuses.That year, seven bills were signed into law allowing limited concealed carry with a permit at K-12 schools (mostly applicable to private schools). Some states have specific exemptions for guns in school zones with a concealed-carry permit, such as guns carried by security or law enforcement or unloaded firearms locked in a vehicle on school property.Trump has argued against gun-free zones at military bases since last October, but he has been less vocal about repealing gun-free zones at schools.The one time he talked about it publicly was at a January 2016 rally in Vermont: “I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools — you have to — and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There’s no more gun-free zones.” His campaign did not respond to requests by the media to clarify his proposal.Our colleague Jenna Johnson reported at the time that the proposal “raises a number of questions, such as: Would this apply to all public schools, from elementary to college? How would schools deal with the likely logistical and safety concerns created by having guns on the grounds?”Trump was asked similar questions a few weeks later during an interview with the Outdoor Channel. This seems to be one of the only times he was ever asked directly about his proposal: How would you mandate that legislation? By executive order? Since public schools are legislated by the states, how could you make such an order stick? Would this legislation apply just to public schools, or private as well?Trump’s answer was still devoid of specifics:“I’m going to get rid of the gun-free zones on the military bases. I’m also going to do it in schools. You say you have a school, and it’s gun-free. The criminals are out there saying, ‘This is incredible. This is perfect. There’s no guns in there. I’m the only one that’s going to have guns.’ You can’t do it. I’m going to work with the states, and if I have to, I’m going to try and perhaps override the states if I have to, if I’m allowed to do that. . . . But we can’t have gun-free zones where, I see schools advertise, ‘We are a gun-free zone.’ And then you have these crazy people out there saying, ‘Boy, this is the most incredible thing,’ and that’s happening.”The Pinocchio TestTrump hasn’t offered many details of his proposal, but it is clear that he wants to force states to allow guns in schools. Would he propose that Congress repeal the federal ban? Would it become illegal for states to pass laws to prohibit concealed carry at schools? The specifics aren’t clear yet.Trump said he would “work with the states” but that he would “override the states if I have to.” Based on what he has said publicly so far, Trump indeed would force schools to allow guns. And he wants to make it happen on his first day as president.The Geppetto Checkmark(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formCheck out our 2016 candidates fact-check pageSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter"
"The 2018 ESPYS celebrated not only the biggest achievements in sports on Wednesday night, but also the spirit and atmosphere of 2018 itself.  The sexual abuse survivors who spoke out against USA gymnastics and Michigan State coach Larry Nassar winning the Arthur Ashe Courage Awards created the most emotionally charged moment of the night. But there were many more tearjerkers throughout the three-hour show, including the heroes of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school shooting — Aaron Feis, Scott Beigel and Chris Hixon — being posthumously named Best Coach.  While millions of viewers watched the 2018 ESPYS live on ABC, TheWrap was inside the Microsoft Theater in downtown Los Angeles.  Also Read: Danica Patrick's ESPYs Monologue Called 'Awkward, 'Cringey' (Video)  Here’s what you didn’t see on TV.  Sexual abuse survivors make a lasting impact  The Arthur Ashe Courage Award is usually presented in the middle of the show but ESPN producers wisely moved it to the end of the night, knowing the importance of the 150 sexual abuse survivors taking to the stage together. The “sister survivors” of Nassar’s abuse over the past 30 years got the entire auditorium on their feet cheering them on. “The greatest tragedy of this is that it could have been avoided … all we needed was just one adult to stand between us and Larry Nassar,” Aly Raisman said in what would be the most impactful words of the night. All of the survivors stayed on the stage long after the end of the show, sharing their historic moment.  Cleveland fans aren’t laughing  “It’s true that the ESPYS have never had a host like me before,” Danica Patrick said to open the show as the first female host. Danica’s jab at Cleveland soon sparked a groan from much of the audience — we guess there are some Browns and Cavaliers fans in the house after all. At least Odell Beckham Jr. found her joke about his hair being “questionable” funny.  Few Fergie fans either …  The “real national anthem controversy” this year wasn’t about NFL players kneeling, Patrick said, as a picture of Fergie butchering the anthem at the NBA All-Star game appeared on the big screen. Oops.  Alex Ovechkin or Putin?  There weren’t many Trump supporters in the crowd, however. The night’s first political joke from Patrick – “I haven’t seen a Russian this pleased with Washington since … at least two days ago” – was tied to the Stanley Cup Finals but we all know who it was really about. And it sparked the first big cheer of the evening.  Also Read: ESPYS Parties 2018: Snoop Dogg, Aly Raisman Kick Off Biggest Week in Sports (Updating Photos)  Welcome to L.A., LeBron  Everyone is on Team LeBron, it seems. When Patrick said James was the biggest off- season acquisition the crowd went wild … but there was deadly silence when she made fun of his thinning hair.  OBJ’s calf flash  OBJ was co-presenter for Biggest Breakout Athlete but it was his legs that had the real breakout moment in a very dashing pair of designer shorts. (The actual recipient was Donovan Mitchell, who joins the realm of past winners like Tom Brady, LeBron James and Dak Prescott.) Antonio Brown later showed off his legs in shorts too, these ESPYS veterans clearly know how hot it gets on the red carpet.  Quiz time  The game played in the first commercial break to entertain attendees picked on random members of the audience. First up was none other than “Black Panther” star Chadwick Boseman, who thankfully knew the name of the biggest NBA scorer in league history. Seattle Seahawks QB Russell Wilson got thrown some movie trivia next but luckily he knew that Boseman starred in “Draft Day.”  Hug it out  The 27-strong US Women’s Hockey team took some time to gather on stage after they won for Best Game because “we’re a hugging team,” admitted one of the Olympic gold medal-winning players.  National karaoke champions?  The Notre Dame women’s basketball champions proved that they’re not only good at scoring, they’re also pretty good at karaoke. It was a little of a bumpy start when two of the players took to the stage to show off their singing skills, but like all the best teams, they had a miraculous comeback. In the next ad break however, the warmup host mistakenly said they were from Villanova.  LeBron dominates the red carpet without even being there  In case you’ve been living under a rock, LeBron James has signed with the LA Lakers. While the former NBA champion wasn’t actually at the ESPYS, that didn’t stop every athlete on the red carpet from being asked what they thought about him coming to Los Angeles.  King James was also on the mind of one audience member who called out his name when any category was announced. No. 23 for Best College Athlete? No, we don’t think so. Biggest Breakthrough? Not this year.  Also Read: Tom Brady, LeBron James Lead 2018 ESPYS Nominations  Top names miss TV spots  Though they’re arguably the best athletes in the world, Tom Brady, LeBron James and Roger Federer won categories that weren’t deemed important enough to be featured on TV — possibly because they weren’t able to attend the show — and their victories were announced during a TV time out.  Eagles fans at it again  Philadelphia Eagles fans are known for being crazy and outspoken (to politely put it), and one middle-aged fanatic in a tuxedo proved that by screaming “PHILADELPHIA” when QB Nick Foles won the Championship Award for his Super Bowl LII win … but it was his young son who looked really embarrassed by the outburst.  Jon Stewart fires up the audience  Jon Stewart complained about the audience’s lack of response when presenting the Pat Tillman Award for Service to Jake Wood. “One cheer for the Marines? Really?” which woke the crowd up to the impact of what former college football player Wood has done in countries like Haiti and for the relief effort in the wake of Hurricane Harvey with Team Rubicon, a non-profit where military veterans lead humanitarian missions to disaster areas.  “He’s also super tall and annoyingly handsome. Last night I saw him making his pregnant wife a hot coffee. I really don’t like this guy,” Stewart said bitterly.  The former “The Daily Show” host’s kick up the ass of the crowd — plus a very moving video of Team Rubicon’s work — earned Wood the first standing ovation of the night. And yes, he really did make Stewart look short.

Many athletes including NFL defensive end Calais Campbell wore Jimmy V pins on the red carpet in their support of cancer research. Former Buffalo Bills QB Jim Kelly was later honored with the 2018 Jimmy V Award for Perseverance – and his heartbreaking story of fighting adversity and “never giving up” brought many in the audience to tears. Kelly, whose cancer of the jaw returned this year, delivered another historical speech despite his struggling to speak and needing help to the stage from his two daughters. ESPN host Cari Champion went on to announce that $1.8 million has been raised in the past two days that will go directly to the Stuart Scott Memorial Cancer Research Fund."

"Gwen Stefani feels like the luckiest girl to be dating Blake Shelton.  When asked earlier Tuesday about the rumors speculating if her boyfriend of two years has been named PEOPLE’s Sexiest Man Alive, the mother of three, 48, gushed about her man.  “What? Oh my God, well they got that right!” Stefani told Access Hollywood.  “Wow, I knew I was on to something. Wow, I’m gonna look really good huh? I already had scored but now I really scored,” she continued.  And even if Shelton is not this year’s pick, Stefani said: “I still score.”  Kevin Mazur/BBMA2017/Getty  The couple has been hot and heavy since they began dating in November 2015 when they met as coaches on The Voice, not long after Shelton’s divorce from fellow country crooner Miranda Lambert and Stefani’s divorce from husband Gavin Rossdale.  And they’ve been inseparable ever since.  WATCH: Gwen Stefani Calls Boyfriend Blake Shelton the ‘Perfect’ Sexiest Man Alive  From red carpet appearances and on-stage performances to their undying support of one another from a distance and their sweet selfies, the pair are a match made in heaven — blending their families together, sharing holidays, and even collaborating on songs including “Go Ahead and Break My Heart” (off of Shelton’s album, If I’m Honest), and “You Make It Feel Like Christmas” (the title track of Stefani’s Christmas album).  Even Shelton’s longtime Voice costar Adam Levine previously said during a Howard Stern Show interview: “They’re so in love it’s disgusting. It’s so funny. They found each other at really interesting times in their lives. It’s really beautiful.”"
"The feud continues between Miley and Selena! Despite the ‘Slow Down’ singer’s attempt to play nice, the former Disney darlings are still at war, a new report claims. Find out how Miley reacted to Selena’s plea that they make up.  Selena Gomez, 22, hoped the 2015 Vanity Fair Oscar Party would be a chance for reconciliation with her old BFF Miley Cyrus, 22 — but the “Wrecking Ball” singer was far from willing to kiss and makeup. Get the scoop on Miley’s public rejection!  Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus Fight: Miley Rejects Plea To End Feud  At the celeb-filled post-Academy Awards party, Selena hoped she would be able to smooth things over with Miley, who she had a falling out with after staring a relationship with Nick Jonas, 22, Miley’s ex, in 2008. The feud worsened when Miley pulled a similar stunt, hooking up with Selena’s ex, Justin Bieber (and getting pregnant!) while the then-couple was on a break, Life & Style reports.  But, while the 22-year-old was willing to leave the boy drama in the past, Miley wasn’t on-board.  “She approached Miley at the party with a smile on her face to say hello,” a source tells the mag of the VF bash. “But Miley kept the convo short, and then left right after. It seemed like she didn’t want to be around Selena.”  Ouch! Poor Selena — considering she’s still so hung up on Justin, it must have taken a lot for her to try and make nice with Miley.  Perhaps Selena’s willingness to forgive is that she’s already gotten her payback…by having a one-night stand with Miley’s former fiancee, Liam Hemsworth, 25! OMG!  “He bragged about it to his friends. It was just a one-night stand, but Miley had no idea!” the mag’s source claims.  WOW! If Miley wasn’t ready to make up with Selena before, she certainly won’t be after she learns about this! These ladies have to stop letting guys come between them like this!  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Selena and Miley’s feud? Do you wish they’d kiss and make up…or are they better off not friends?  — Alyssa Norwin"
"A Few Questions We’re Asking About Robert Pattinson’s New Wife by Jess Commons | 12 09 2014 Bad news Twihards – Edward Cullen is off the market  Meet Laura Adkins, the 25-year-old who’s gone and done what every teenager on the face of this planet has wanted to do for ages – marry Robert Pattinson.  Except she hasn’t.  See, what Laura’s REALLY gone and done is marry a cardboard cutout of Edward Cullen. But differentiating between the two things is just splitting hairs, right?  Laura told the Sunday People, ‘People think I’m crazy, but my flat-pack R-Patz is the closest I’ll get to the real thing and he’s the one for me.’    Lauren paid $20 for her 2-D husband whom she married in a Las Vegas chapel back in January in front of 50 guests. ‘The day cost £2,000 but I didn’t care – I wanted to do it properly.’  Just like any newlyweds, the two headed off on a honeymoon afterwards. The couple chose Los Angeles as a destination where Laura was keen to climb up to the Hollywood sign. ‘I had to carry him, and we had to do it at night because he can’t be in the sun, but everyone makes sacrifices for the man they love, right?’ Right.  While we’re totally on board with doing whatever makes you happy – even if that something is marrying a cardboard version of a fictional character – there’s a few questions that this story’s left us asking.    For instance:  Going out  According to Laura, she regularly takes Edward out to bars where she orders him a beer, and her a gin and tonic. Which is cool and all, but what happens to the beer? Is Laura forced to drink it herself, therefore getting doubly drunk? Or does she pour it down a little hole she’s made in Edward’s mouth, drying his soggy lips off under the handdryer afterwards?  READ MORE: How True Blood Started A Sexual Revolution In Television  Sustainability  Being the proud owners of a Henry VIII cutout (not even joking), myself and my housemates are basically experts in the lifecycle of such a product, and let me tell you right now, cardboard is not the most substantial of materials. Damp, open flames and general roughhousing have not been kind to Henry and he’s not even a cutout that’s allowed outside. Laura takes Edward on real-life holidays – how much more of a shelf-life can her husband have? Does Laura replace him every three months? Has she covered him in some form of protective laminate material?  Identity  While the cutout is of Robert Pattison playing Edward Cullen in one of the Twilight films (sorry I don’t know which one. I got halfway into the whole werewolf/vampire bro-off and couldn’t handle the angst), Laura refers to it (him?) as ‘R-Patz’ therefore prompting the question; is she in love with Robert or Edward? Or an amalgamation of the two? Are they even different people? Or is Robert Pattinson actually a vampire? Might explain some things.  Er, bonking  Sorry to take this to the lowest common denominator but have the two ever consummated their marriage? Is this something that can happen with a cardboard cutout? And if so, how? Is it any good?  READ MORE: Meet The Girls Eating 4,000 Calories A Day Because It Turns Their Boyfriends On  Husbandly duties  While cardboard isn’t heavy, six feet of it is awkward to carry around. Will Laura ever get annoyed with her husband's lack of mobility? Is there some sort of system she can rig up with a skateboard – like those dogs that lose their back legs – that means she doesn’t have to carry him everywhere? More importantly, without the ability to speak, walk or think, he’s kind of useless as a husband. How’s he going to bring home the bacon? Provide kids? Fix the Netflix when the SCART lead comes unplugged?  Going forward  Perhaps our biggest question about this whole story is: doesn’t Laura deserve better? She seems like a nice girl. She’s certainly inventive, media savvy and has no qualms about going out and getting exactly what she wants. So what’s she doing with someone (thing?) that can’t tell her how great she is every day? Our advice to Laura? Give old R-Patz the ceremonial bonfire of a goodbye he deserves and get yourself on Tinder.  I mean, really  !  Like this?

"As this star's freedom was revoked, in the back of a packed courtroom sat four very happy people.  In contrast to Dance Mom's Abby Lee Millers tears over her jail sentence, four former reality television moms were laughing it up, the star told InTouch.  A group of the 50-year-old former students' mothers - Kelly Hyland, Christi Lukasiak, Dawn Check and Diane Pent - sat in the back of the Pittsburgh courtroom May 9 as the instructor was sentence to a year and a day in jail.  Laughing stock: Abby Lee Miller (pictured May 14) has revealed her former co-stars laughed at her sentencing  Celebrated: A group of the 50-year-old former students' mothers - L-R Diane Pent, Christi Lukasiak, Dawn Check and Kelly Hyland - sat in the back of the Pittsburgh courtroom May 9 as the instructor was sentence to a year and a day in jail  And Abby Lee was all too aware that the four women had come to watch the show that was her bankruptcy fraud case.  The reality star told InTouch she was hurt: 'They were all laughing at me.'  Not nice: The reality star told InTouch she was hurt, 'They were all laughing at me'  But they were not just laughing, post-court the four moms headed to a home and toasted Abby Lee's sentence with a bottle of pricey Dom Perignon champagne.  All four women shared the snap on their Instagrams which showed them all beaming from ear-to-ear.  Diane captioned the image: 'Great day with great friends! @kellylhyland @christilukasiak @dawncheck cheers!'  Dawn - a minister who Abby once called the police on - followed suit saying 'friends' on one picture and then 'silliness. Because' on a different angle.  But Kelly Hyland was not as subtle, captioning the photograph: 'Who is the happiest ???'  There is no love lost between Kelly and Abby with the pair once getting in a physical fight on-camera which Kelly was arrested for.  The Dance Mom and her daughter also went on to sue Abby and the show's production company but eventually settled.  Abby was not amused at the ladies' joy over her sentence as she has previously spoken of her fears that she will be attacked or sexually assaulted in prison.  According to InTouch, the reality star will start her sentence June 23 The Federal Correctional Institute in Dublin, California.

"Last April, Selena Gomez was photographed while on vacation in Mexico. She was wearing a swimsuit, which is normal vacation behavior. But Selena isn't any ordinary human, and internet trolls pounced on the chance to tear Selena apart for looking ""fat"" in paparazzi photos.  She handled the body-shaming by posting a personal bathing suit shot to Instagram, which she captioned, ""I love being happy with me yall,"" along with the hashtag #TheresMoreToLove.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  But that was last year and this is now. And while she's always looked stunning, at the start of her worldwide solo tour, Selena has visibly less to love.  Getty  Getty  Her changed body is the result of over a year working with trainer Amy Rosoff Davis, who has not only been looking after the singer's fitness but also her diet and lifestyle.  Since starting last spring, Selena has worked out with Amy anywhere from three to five days a week, and in the last couple months before the start of the ""Revival"" tour, they were working out seven days a week for up to two hours at a time — on top of which Selena was doing back-to-back run-throughs of her 90-minute show during rehearsal. While on tour with Selena in Sacramento, California, Amy spoke to Cosmopolitan.com about what Selena did to get the body she has now.  Getty  Getty | Krystalina Tom  1. No weighing. ""I've never weighed her,"" Amy said. ""I don't believe in scales — I just don't think it's healthy."" But, because she and Selena work so closely together, she can tell when Selena's body changes or when her clothes fit differently, which they have been. ""I can definitely see the difference, and other people can too,"" she said. ""But ultimately, a body that eats well and works is going to look better because it's healthy.""  Getty  2. No dieting. There's nothing that's off-limits when it comes to food — although that doesn't mean Amy won't encourage better choices — there's just less of it. ""I want to live my life like a French person,"" Amy said. ""I don't believe in denying yourself, but I also believe in moderation. Life is too short not to enjoy food.""  These days are always the best days. A post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Jun 29, 2015 at 10:36am PDT  3. Switch from fast food to whole food. About that: Selena speaks with pride about eating like she's from Texas. ""She loves Tex-Mex and fast food that I would normally not condone,"" Amy said. ""I will walk onto the tour bus and smell fast food, throw it in the trash, and hand her a carrot and hummus."" Changing Selena's eating habits has helped a lot in shaping her physique, Amy said. ""She responds really quickly. We'll do barely any ab exercises and two days later, I'm like, 'Whoa!'""  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Amy has been incorporating more whole foods and healthy organic ingredients into Selena's meals. Here's a breakdown of what Selena might eat in a day:  Breakfast: Half of a healthy breakfast burrito of scrambled eggs, chorizo, avocado, rice, and beans; or, full-fat Greek yogurt and granola.  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  Lunch: A ""power salad"" of turkey, avocado, beans, with a homemade dressing of red wine vinegar, olive oil, dijon mustard, and lemon juice.  Dinner: Teriyaki bowl with Asian-marinated cucumber, salmon or chicken, avocado, and teriyaki sauce over rice; or sushi.  Amy Rosoff Davis  Selena also has a juicer in her dressing room so she can have a juice before she goes on stage. Amy's been making her juices with cucumber, carrot, kale, and ginger. Not that Selena is necessarily into it, but it's what she's doing right now.  4. Never let your body get bored. Selena has been doing cardio, Pilates, and yoga of all kinds.  She and Amy go on long hikes with some of Selena's crew, where they'll break to do circuit training and ""arm dancing"" and ""side chassés up a hill."" Amy said, ""I've always believed the best way to keep your muscles active is to mix it up. We switch things up almost every day.""  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  5. Stretch. A lot. Amy stresses the importance of having a limber body and says that becoming more flexible has helped Selena ""let go."" Sometimes, Selena will even do a combined stretching and vocal warmup session.  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  6. Water, water, water. ""I'm a big water pusher,"" Amy said. ""All the time. I'm always putting a bottle of water in someone's hand."" It's clearly worked. Selena toldVogue that ""I always have water, tons of water. It's even in my bathroom because I used to be so bad at drinking water and I want to stay hydrated.""  Getty  7. Sweat it out. Amy introduced Selena to Shape House, an ""urban sweat lodge"" where clients lie for 55 minutes in an ""infrared burrito"" and leave with skin that is ""literally glowing,"" Amy said. According to Shape House's website, one ""typical sweat session burns between 800 to 1,600 calories."" Selena loves the process of infrared sweating so much that she has a sweat bag for the road.  8. Have a healthy body image. ""When you feel good, you exude confidence, and you feel strong and healthy,"" Amy said. ""You wear it well inside and outside of your skin.""  comin soon @stevenkleinstudio hehe A post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Dec 16, 2015 at 8:43pm PST  9. Nourish the body and soul. While they were in Northern California, Amy researched good spots to hike, and it's a practice she hopes to continue throughout the whole tour. ""We want to find beautiful things in each town that makes it what it is,"" she said. ""You're in a hotel, or you're on a bus or in a show for so much of the time that it's nice to get out in nature where there's no technology and no people."" After the two-hour hike outside Sacramento, they stopped at a waterfall and stood there for a few minutes to breathe and watch the water. ""It was such a perfect combination of mind, body, and soul,"" Amy said. ""Health, fitness, food — all of it is so important. What we put in our mouths and our souls affects everything.""

"CBS  Tom Cruise is no stranger to dangerous stunts, but the same can't be said for ""The Late Late Show"" host James Corden. For his latest stunt, Cruise brought Corden along with him: skydiving at 15,000 feet for a ""Late Late Show"" segment on Thursday.  It was almost an impossible mission, though. Corden joked that he tried to reach Cruise multiple times to cancel.  Before they got in the air, Corden was his usual comedic self, asking Cruise if there was ""meal service"" on the plane and coming up with a hand signal for if he soiled himself. When Corden met the professional that he'd be diving with, Danny, who was dressed in a T-shirt and shorts, he said, ""We're not skydiving into Margaritaville, I want someone who looks like they know what they're doing.""  But Danny had dived 7,000 times already, which promptly reassured Corden.  Cruise, meanwhile, took it all in stride. The actor skydived for a scene in ""Mission: Impossible — Fallout,"" and he jumped out of a plane 106 times at 30,000 feet for the shot. He even slept on the plane as it ascended while Corden sat nervously waiting.  Before they dived, Corden called his wife, and Cruise said he would take care of her if Corden dies. She joked that it would be a ""better life.""  She's stuck with Corden, though, as they finally jumped and reached the ground.  ""Mission: Impossible — Fallout"" is in theaters now.

"Every day seems to bring a new headline about sexual harassment. It’s crucial to talk about how commonplace this abuse is, but it’s becoming more difficult to do so without becoming exhausted or desensitized. It’s what makes Saturday Night Live’s recent exploration of harassment — a visually soft, musical number from Cecily Strong, Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Leslie Jones, and Melissa Villaseñor, with guest Saoirse Ronan — feel like a warm shower after a roll through the mud.  Over the weekend, SNL debuted a catchy pop culture parody tackling the unending wave of sexual harassment allegations. This movement seems to have started with Harvey Weinstein, but the ripple has traveled far beyond Hollywood, and into industries and locations across the world. As the song title aptly puts it, “Welcome to Hell.”  Musical comedy is nothing new for SNL, and the show has touched on feminist issues in group parodies before. But the biting juxtaposition of bubblegum pop and sexual harassment feels more like an outtake from the CW show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, which regularly uses musical comedy to deconstruct thorny subjects like mental health and sexism. “Welcome to Hell” is a dead ringer for Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s man-hating anthem “Let’s Generalize About Men,” where series co-creator Rachel Bloom and company examine the pitfalls of the male population — and mock the way women talk about them.  Crazy Ex-Girlfriend built its reputation on this sort of egalitarian satire, where its frustrated female characters declare that all men are emotionally stunted children while simultaneously acknowledging that this is absurd hyperbole. (“There are no exceptions / All 3 billion men are like this / All 3.6 billion men.”) It plays on stereotypes from both sides: the women engaging in their proclaimed “primal ritual” of drinking and complaining, the men putting up a tiresome cry of “not all men.” The SNL song, on the other hand, represents a more literal case of ideologies clashing. Its staff can write and perform songs about harassment, but the show has also invited notorious abusers like Casey Affleck to host. (Louis CK has hosted the show four times.)  “Welcome to Hell” is parody, but only in how it chooses to deliver its information. Dressed in pink or pastel and sporting sweetheart looks, these performers do their best bubblegum pop impression while addressing a harsh reality: harassment has always been part of women’s lives. “Oh, this been the damn world,” Strong sings of the recent headlines. Jones pops in to say, “But you do know that it’s like a million times worse for a woman of color, right?” The short even demonstrates some self-defense tactics women are taught: McKinnon holding her keys between her fingers to thwart would-be attackers, or Strong demonstrating acting so crazy, would-be molesters will decide she’s “not worth the trouble.”  The grief people may feel over House of Cards being “ruined” after Kevin Spacey was fired, or whatever surprise they may experience at learning how widespread harassment is, pales in comparison to the frustration that acts as the song’s throughline. Why didn’t women say something? “Well, we definitely did,” Ronan says. “For hundreds of years.” It’s the understatement of the century."
"This time last week they were enjoying a romantic vacation in St Barts to celebrate Scott Disick's birthday, complete with 'love you' declarations on social media.  But just days after jetting home, Sofia Richie has dumped her older boyfriend.  And now the reason for the young model's change of heart has become clear - an ultimatum from her father, Lionel Richie.  Revealed: Sofia Richie's dad Lionel threatened to cut her off and remove her from will if she didn’t dump cheating Scott Disick; she is seen solo in Los Angeles on Sunday  Ultimatum: Telling Sofia he would cut her out of his will if she continued to date 'toxic' Scott, Lionel left the 19-year-old with no choice; the father and daughter are seen earlier this year  The veteran singer reportedly gave Sofia a simple choice, after she confided in him that father-of-three Scott had cheated on her.  Telling his daughter he would cut her out of his will if she continued to date 'toxic' Scott, Lionel left the 19-year-old in no doubt about his views.  A source told Us Weekly: '[Scott] cheated on her in Miami and she found out and told [Lionel]. He said he is going to cut her off and write her out of his will if she continues her relationship with Scott as he thinks he’s extremely toxic for her.'  While initially Sofia had considered trying to work things out, despite her boyfriend's alleged infidelity, things changed when he went to Wyoming for Kanye West's album listening party.  Birthday wishes: Last week the two were in St Barts, with Sofia posting this picture to celebrate Scott Disick's 35th birthday  Final straw: While initially Sofia had considered trying to work things out, despite her boyfriend's alleged infidelity, things changed when he went to Wyoming for Kanye West's album listening party on Thursday  He was pictured there with his arms around a blonde woman, and overheard telling people he was single'.  Within hours Sofia, 19, had moved out of 35-year-old Scott's Los Angeles home, and was back living with her dad.  On Instagram she kept busy posting pictures from her dad's house as she watched Jersey Shore on TV and snuggled her dog Hershela, the name chosen by Scott.  All Night Long singer Lionel had previously joked about his daughter's on/off relationship with the much older man, saying the pairing was 'just a phase'.  Scott is a father-of-three from his nine-year relationship with ex Kourtney Kardashian, named Mason, eight, Penelope, five, and Reign, three."

"Alanis Morrissette‘s ex-manager was sentenced to six years in prisonon Wednesday for embezzling millions from the singer.  Johnathan Schwartz pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud and filing a false tax return in January, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  He admitted to stealing over $5 million from Morissette, as well as an additional $1.7 million from two other unnamed clients.  According to the Associated Press at the time, the incidents occurred between May 2010 and January 2014, with Schwartz falsely listing the criminal withdrawals as “sundry/personal expenses.” When first questioned about the mismanagement by prosecutors, he initially claimed that he had invested in an illicit marijuana growing business.  Schwartz will serve six years in prison along with $8.65 million in restitution, Variety reports. He will report for his prison sentence on July 11.  The 47-year-old wept and apologized during the court hearing Wednesday, saying he took full responsibility for his behavior, according to The Chicago Tribune.  “I alone am responsible for the devastation,” he said, adding: “I will spend the rest of my life asking for forgiveness.”  FROM COINAGE: What Is the Grammy Bounce? (No, It’s Not a Dance Move)  The Tribune reports Schwartz could have faced more than 20 years in federal prison after pleading guilty, but Judge Dolly Gee suggested a sentencing guideline around five to six years.  Morissette urged a harsher sentence in a victim statement at the hearing, the newspaper reports, saying he had stolen her trust and money.  “He did this in a long, systematic, drawn-out and sinister manner,” she said."
"It’s only week 3, but the drama has already begun on Dancing with the Stars.  After Tom Bergeron opened guilty pleasures night by dedicating the show to those affected by the Las Vegas shooting, cohost Erin Andrews informed the audience that pro dancer Maks Chmerkovskiy wouldn’t be taking the stage Monday.  “Maks is dealing with a personal issue so Alan is stepping in and dancing with Vanessa tonight,” she said, referring to pro Alan Bersten, who got eliminated last week with partner Debbie Gibson.  Craig Sjodin via Getty  However, sources confirm to PEOPLE that Chmerkovskiy did not perform by choice because of ongoing conflict with Lachey.  “There’s a big chemistry issue,” the insider says. “They both have big personalities and that’s not always the best recipe for a good partnership.”  PEOPLE’s special issue 25 Seasons of ‘Dancing with the Stars’ is on stands now.  While the former Total Request Live host, 36, has called the Ukrainian dancer the “best coach,” the source adds, “They’ve been fighting a lot.” (Reps for Chmerkovskiy and Lachey could not immediately be reached for comment.)  This isn’t the first time Chmerkovskiy, 37, has butted heads with his DWTS celebrity counterparts. In 2015, he told The Real of his season 13 partner, soccer star Hope Solo, “That’s literally the only person that I could dislike from my past, present or future.”  On the other hand, Chmerkovskiy and Olympic skater Meryl Davis, who won season 18, brought out the best in each other.  “I feel that I can really be myself with Maks,” she told PEOPLE in 2014. “He pushes me to stand up for myself, whether it’s in real life or on the dance floor. It’s cool.”  He added at the time, “She lets me be creative. I’ve already done more on this season than I’ve done on Dancing with the Stars in 13 seasons.”  RELATED VIDEO: Peta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy Welcome Son Shai Aleksander  Andrews, now 39, has also raved about her experience working with the new dad on season 10. ““The reason why Maks and I worked out so well was because I come from a world where all I worked with was men, and pretty much I’m like a guy in a lot of ways,” the ESPN personality told PEOPLE in 2015.  When it comes to Lachey, though, the insider says last week could’ve been her last performance with Chmerkovskiy: “I wouldn’t be surprised if Maks doesn’t return as her partner for the rest of the season.”  However, a DWTS rep says Chmerkovskiy will compete next week.  Dancing with the Stars airs Mondays on ABC at 8 p.m. ET."
"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. They were finally ready to announce to the world that they were a couple.  Since then, Holmes and Foxx have been spotted together more openly at various events, including sitting next to each other at Clive Davis’s Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, People reported. Holmes also turned up at Foxx’s 50th birthday party in Los Angeles in mid-December.  Holmes’ romantic history has long been marked by intense, high-profile highs and devastating lows, especially surrounding her high-octane courtship and marriage to Cruise.  Holmes and Cruise got engaged in 2005 after just seven weeks of dating. Cruise famously gushed about his love for Holmes by jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s TV show couch. They became parents to daughter Suri in 2006 and married in a lavish Church of Scientology wedding in an Italian castle.  Holmes initiated the divorce from Cruise because she reportedly became concerned about raising Suri as a Scientologist. Numerous investigative reports over the years have shown that the Church exercises an enormous amount of control over the lives of members, including over how parents raise their children. Critics regard Scientology as a mind-controlling cult.  What appears certain about Holmes’ life is that she’s been a devoted, protective mother to Suri, doing the best she can to raise her on her own.  Numerous reports describe Suri as an intelligent, kind-hearted girl, with Holmes herself opening up about her daughter’s philanthropic heart in a 2015 interview with Today.  “My little one is very, very generous and very sensitive,” Holmes said, according to People.  Over the years, their mother-daughter bond has been documented in photos at events, as in when Suri and Holmes appeared on the Madison Square Garden stage together in December to introduce Taylor Swift at the Jingle Ball concert.  Holmes also has shared images of their sometimes playful, friendly bond in a series of photos she has posted to Instagram."
"In Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America’s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”Some of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that “the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze’s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: “Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here’s Why.” That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze’s work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people’s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)"
"Eliza Dushku has accused stunt coordinator Joel Kramer of molesting her when she was 12 years old. Kramer has denied the allegations.  Her account, posted early Saturday morning, comes in the wake of the continuing #metoo movement and the launch of the Time’s Up campaign to combat sexual harassment and assault.  In a Facebook post, Dushku wrote that she was assaulted while working with Kramer on the 1994 James Cameron film “True Lies.” According to her post, Kramer molested her in a Miami hotel room, where he “laid me down on the bed, wrapped me with his gigantic writhing body, and rubbed all over me.” Kramer would have been 36 at the time.  Dushku alleges that he “methodically built my and my parents’ trust, for months grooming me,” and told her parent that he would take her for a swim in the hotel’s pool. Instead, her took her to his hotel room, where he “disappeared in the bathroom and emerged, naked, bearing nothing but a small hand towel held flimsy at his mid-section.”  Kramer told Variety Saturday morning that Dushku’s allegations were “absolutely not true.” According to Kramer, Dushku swam in the hotel pool with him and other members of the stunt crew, including Dushku’s stunt double. Afterwards, he took her to her first ever sushi meal, and then took her home.  Related Eliza Dushku Slams CBS, Michael Weatherly for Alleged Harassment and Retaliation on 'Bull' 'OITNB' Actress Yael Stone Accuses Geoffrey Rush of Sexual Harassment  After the alleged assault, Dushku wrote, he suggested they should “be careful,” referring to talking about the incident.  Dushku also wrote that while in a taxi back to her hotel, Kramer held her on his lap in the backseat. According to Kramer, he drove the car to take her home.  She also implies that Kramer may have intentionally harmed her while on the set of “True Lies,” referring to it as “no small coincidence” when she was injured on-set after a “tough adult female friend” faced him about the alleged assault.  “With broken ribs, I spent the evening in the hospital,” she wrote. “To be clear, over the course of those months rehearsing and filming ‘True Lies,’ it was Joel Kramer who was responsible for my safety on a film that at the time broke new ground for action films.”  She also wrote that Kramer would call her “Jailbait,” and that she doesn’t understand why no adults on the set grew suspicious of the “over-the-top special attention he gave me.”  “Over the years I’ve really struggled as I’ve wondered how my life might have been different if someone, any one grown-up who witnessed his sick ways, had spoken up before he lured me to that hotel room.”  Dushku explained that she had heard, years ago, that Kramer had been “found out” and forced to leave the business, but recently learned he was still working in the industry.  “And a few weeks ago, I found an internet photo of Joel Kramer hugging a young girl,” she wrote. “That image has haunted me near nonstop since. I can no longer hide what happened.”  She expressed gratitude for the support of her fans, and wrote that she hopes her speaking out will help other victims of sexual assault.  Kramer stated that he was “taken aback” and “floored” by the allegations, and that he “never molested her” and was “never nude in front of her.”  “This whole talk of luring her to my room, on top of her, getting off, holding her in the car and calling her jailbait is just outright hyperbole and lies,” he said.  Kramer, who has worked on numerous high-profile films such as “Blade Runner 2049” and “Furious 7,” said he had no explanation for the allegations, but stated that he thought she may have had a crush on him at the time. According to Kramer, another person working on the set had told him that Dushku was “always asking questions” about him, which caused him to feel he had to “handle her with kid gloves.”  “I did kiss her on the cheek once to say goodnight to her, gave her a hug,” he said. “We treated her like family, she was part of our crew.”  He referred to the allegations as “absurd,” asserting that it would have made no sense for him to act in the manner he accused her of. “Who in their right mind would do something like that, when you’re a high-profile coordinator on a shoot like that with months left of shooting?”  Dushku’s legal guardian on the set of “True Lies,” Sue Booth-Forbes, issued a statement supporting Dushku’s account to Deadline Hollywood.  “Eliza Dushku is telling the truth,” she told the outlet. “I was on the ‘True Lies’ set for three weeks and reported Joel Kramer’s inappropriate sexual behavior towards 12-year-old Eliza to a person in authority. I was met with blank stares and had the sense that I wasn’t telling that person anything they didn’t already know.”"

"Wow, it seems like no Hollywood relationship is safe from divorce, even after 21 years of marriage.  Actress and singer Tisha Campbell-Martin, 49, has filed for divorce from husband, actor Duane Martin, 52 confirmed by PEOPLE. The couple shares a total of 27 years together, and 21 years of marriage.  “After 27 years of being together and two amazing children, it pains me to announce that I’ve filed for divorce,” Tisha, 49, said in the statement.  You May Also Like 'Martin' TV Turns 25: Thanks For The Laughs  The pair had been repeatedly featured on just about everyone’s list of Black Love couples who have stood the test of time. While there have been many rumors of husband Duane Martin’s sexuality and possible infidelity, the couple has never responded and seem to have always pushed forward.  “It’s an emotional time and I graciously ask for privacy for me, our children and the rest of our family,” she shared.  Over the course of their marriage, the pair, who wed in 1996, had two children: sons Ezekiel, 8, and Xen, 16.  Duane Martin and Tisha both starred in Kevin Harts scripted reality series, Real Husbands of Hollywood for the past couple of seasons. Tisha, of course, starred on Martin Lawrence’s hit 90’s show, ‘Martin’ for five seasons before the sitcom went off the air in 1997 due to serious riffs between Martin Lawrence and Campbell-Martin.  (Photo credit: Black Celebrity Kids online) (Photo credit: Black Celebrity Kids online)  But all of this seems a little bit ironic now, since Tisha and Martin are back friends again.

"Simila­r to any other woman, she has been throug­h a fair share of good and bad days  Hollywood starlet Angelina Jolie can easily be counted as one of the most beautiful women in the world. Similar to any other woman, she has been through a fair share of good and bad days too. However, nothing has ever shown on her face. And boy, we are impressed! Compiled from InStyle, we dig out her changing looks through the years.  1986  With her full lips and bright blue eyes, the 11-year-old daughter of Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand was clearly destined to be a spectacular beauty.  1991  As a student at Beverly Hills High School, Jolie was an unknown quantity. “I wore black boots with big silver bat [charms] that dragged when I walked,” Jolie said earlier. “I wasn’t aware of how I looked, but apparently I looked really creepy.”  1998  The pixie-cropped actor won her first Golden Globe for TV biopic George Wallace. The following year she would receive a second statuette for her role in Gia.  1999  She went platinum for Girl, Interrupted, but limited her beauty routine to Carmex and lotion.  2003  The Beyond Borders star, and new mother to adopted son Maddox, lightened up both her locks and makeup for a fresh look.  2007  “Her mouth is so large and beautiful,” makeup artist Janeen Schreyer has said of the born beauty. “I usually don’t colour it.” Hairstylist Ted Gibson shows similar restraint. “She loves to keep a natural wave in her hair. It’s more sensual,” he said.  Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt might be getting back together  2008  Pregnant with twins Knox and Vivienne, the actress glowed in a high-volume style at the Kung Fu Panda premiere.  2013  Jolie attended the world premiere of then fiancé Brad Pitt’s movie World War Z just weeks after she revealed she underwent a preventative double mastectomy. She wowed the crowd in a black, floor-length Saint Laurent gown with her caramel locks in a casual curl.  2016  Jolie wore her hair smooth and straight and opted for a pared down beauty look for the Kung Fu Panda 3 Hollywood premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre.  2017  She was back to retro curls and her classic red lip in 2017.  2018    Only blossoming with age, the red pout seems to have become a regular in Jolie’s makeup routine. The 42-year-old is definitely both beauty and brains.  Have something to add to the story? Share it in the comments below.  Read full story"

"Every breakup has its stages, but, for Chloë Grace Moretz and Brooklyn Beckham —the now former celebrity couple whose on-again, off-again love saga is a film waiting to be written—it's easy to get stuck in the subtweet phase. Proving that romance, or the dissolution of it, is really no different for celebrities than it is for anyone else, the couple are currently in the throes of shading each other on social media. Or, at least, some people think that's the case. Let's take a look at the facts.  A few days after photos surfaced of Beckham kissing model Lexi Wood, when the rest of the world had presumed he was still dating Moretz, the pair made some interesting moves on Instagram. Moretz posted a screenshot to let the world know that she's listening to Cardi B 's ""Be Careful,"" perhaps the most revealing song on the rapper's recently released debut album Invasion of Privacy . In the song, which has become an anti-cheaters anthem of sorts, Cardi B addresses her fiancé Offset's infidelity and gives him an ultimatum. ""Poured out my whole heart to a piece of s**t,"" she raps, ""Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson..../ Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo/ And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives..../ Be careful with me/ Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'."" Moretz captioned the screenshot with two words: ""The queen.""  What's more, Moretz liked a meme posted by a fan account of her giving the middle finger with the caption ""Greetings to Brooklyn Beckham from me motherf***er,"" as Perez Hilton later pointed out.  Meanwhile, Beckham weighed in on the situation not with his own post, but instead by liking another meme that depicted him crying as a young boy next to his mother, Victoria Beckham with the caption ""Chloe's fans are attacking Brooklyn Beckham.""  Loading View on Instagram  But how did we get here? To recap, Moretz and Beckham first linked up in 2014 at Paris Fashion Week. They didn't officially enter into a public-facing relationship, though, until April 2016. Not long after, they called off their relationship once again, this time citing the long distance between them. (Beckham was living in London, while Moretz was Stateside.) She later talked about that breakup , saying that she just wanted to hide. “They were like, 'That’s all great that you want to go away—but you can’t. You are your own person,'"" she said. ""'You’re going to have to deal with this sort of thing.’ I felt like things were falling apart, like my head and heart weren’t in the same place. Things started to change when I realized I have the power within to change them.” With that knowledge, hopefully this ending will be easier on the couple."
"Jamie Foxx did not “betray” Katie Holmes by supposedly “getting flirty” with a mystery blonde at a New York City hotspot, despite a bogus report. Gossip Cop can debunk this narrative. It’s simply a non-issue.  According to In Touch, just a few days after the actor had dinner with Holmes at Tao in NYC, he got cozy with another woman while having lunch at the trendy seafood restaurant Catch. An alleged insider tells the magazine, “When Jamie arrived to the rooftop area with friends, an attractive young blonde went and sat with them. She hugged Jamie and sat next to him.”  The outlet’s questionable source further contends that Foxx “would reach over and touch the woman’s leg or hold her hand” throughout the lunch. The magazine then baselessly theorizes that Holmes is “headed for heartbreak,” quoting its supposed insider as saying, “She needs to watch out. Jamie loves her, but he also loves to flirt.”  © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  It should be noted, the tabloid doesn’t have any real proof that Foxx got “flirty” with a mystery blonde at Catch. The outlet provides two photos, one of the actor giving a friendly hug to an unidentified woman, and another of him touching the woman’s arm during a conversation. That’s as intimate as the two get in the images and there’s no evidence to suggest they’re anything more than friends.  Regardless, Gossip Cop can confirm that Holmes doesn’t feel “betrayed” when the actor socializes with other woman. The actor and actress have a somewhat unconventional dynamic, which People also noted in a recent article about Holmes and Foxx’s secretive relationship. The publication explained that the two “don’t see themselves as a couple in the traditional sense and they don’t want to be labeled as a couple.” It was further stressed that neither “want to have expectations placed on them about how they should be acting in public.”  Meanwhile, the unreliable magazine is trying to make it seem as if Foxx was caught acting inappropriately by talking to another woman, but he has nothing to hide. A mutual pal of ours and the movie star recently told us “he knows he’s in a public forum” when he chats with other women. As we’ve repeatedly noted, Foxx and Holmes enjoy spending time together, but their dynamic is relaxed and both have their own separate lives.  Additionally, this isn’t the first time Gossip Cop has called out In Touch for coming up with a variation of this phony premise. Back in March, we busted the tabloid for falsely claiming that Foxx “betrayed” Holmes by “getting cozy” with a mystery woman at an Oscar party. However, the actor and actress have been spotted together several times since March, so she obviously didn’t feel “betrayed.” That remains the case."
"A day before Demi Lovato's apparent drug overdose, the star and her ""new"" group of friends were reportedly on a ""binger"" and were prepared for extreme measures by having Narcan, an emergency medication that is used to revive people in instances of narcotic overdoses, on hand.  TMZ reported that Lovato, 25, refused to tell paramedics what drugs may have caused the overdose and was not cooperative with EMTs when they arrived at her home on Tuesday. A source told Fox News that ""it's not heroin."" According to the outlet, no drugs were found at the scene and no charges pressed.  People magazine reported that Lovato and her group of friends were prepared for their night of partying.  “She and her ‘friends’ were on a binger the entire night,” an insider told the outlet. “They keep Narcan on hand for such situations – they were prepared for this. The people she has been hanging around lately aren’t her real friends – they don’t have her best interests at heart. She’s pushed her true friends away.”  The source added, “She had to find creative and sneaky ways to get drugs because her team and those that really care about her really try to keep a close watch on her.”  Lovato's long-time band guitarist, Mike Manning, spoke out about the singer's new group of friends saying that he planned to expose all of those who were involved in Monday night's ""binger"" and added, ""I almost lost my sister today.""  ""Anybody who was with Demi last night and actually calls themselves a friend should actually be disgusted with themselves. SICK,"" Manning said according to the Daily Mail.  He added, ""You can never trust anyone. Never can know if your ""friends"" are truly on your side or not.""  According to TMZ, Lovato's longtime team attempted to stage an intervention to get help for the troubled singer but she ""blew them off."" The news follows the departure of Lovato's long-serving manager, Phil McIntyre, who was reportedly a part of the intervention.  Lovato had been preparing for a months-long string of performances set to start Thursday night in Atlantic City, N.J., and take her to venues as far as Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. The singer's Atlantic City concert has since been canceled.  Signs of trouble began in the days leading up to the overdose when a video of the singer forgetting the lyrics to her song ""Sober,"" surfaced online. Lovato wrote the single, released in late June, about relapsing after celebrating six years of sobriety.  Lovato's profound ""Sober"" lyrics read, “Mama, I’m so sorry I’m not sober anymore/And Daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor. To the ones who never left me/We’ve been down this road before/I’m so sorry, I’m not sober anymore.”  Though Lovato has been vocal about her struggles throughout the years, another insider revealed to People that Lovato’s period of sobriety was full of ups and downs.  “Demi was never really clean and sober from all of her demons. She has been fighting depression and anxiety for quite some time — and is still in such a dark place. She was sober for a while, but not completely sober for six years.”  The star, who is ""in stable condition"" and with her family at the hospital according to a statement from her rep, has also found support from her ex-boyfriend, former ""That 70's Show"" star Wilmer Valderrama.  Valderrama, who dated Lovato for six years before their break up in June 2016, was reportedly “shocked” after hearing the news that Lovato was hospitalized on Tuesday.  “He knew she was going through a tough time but he wasn’t prepared for this,” a source told People. “He saw her through so many ups and downs and was her rock through some of her darkest moments. To see her back in such a sad and vulnerable place is heartbreaking for him.”  The source added that Valderrama, “always cared deeply” for Lovato and even after they split the two have remained friends.  So much so that Valderrama paid his ex a visit on Wednesday, according to People. The 38-year-old star visited Lovato in the hospital following her apparent overdose yesterday afternoon.  “Demi always hoped they would end up back together in the future,” a source revealed to the magazine. “He’s the love of her life and vice versa.”  Lovato remains in the hospital."

We can feel more than one thing at once you know? We can hold both love and wonder and aw and joy, but also frustration and sickness and fear and darker stuff too and it’s normal!”  She continued, “With all the mystery and wonder around this, one thing that has been abundantly clear to me: this little unbelievable soul that I haven’t even met yet is going to be my biggest teacher in the world and I cannot wait to learn.”  Rachel Platten Neilson Barnard/Getty  RELATED VIDEO: Rachel Platten Opens Up About the Emotional Stories She Receives from Her Fans    The Wildfire singer — who released her sophomore album Waves last October — previously opened up to PEOPLE about how her husband helped inspire her song “Collide.”  ” ‘Collide’ is about not wanting to hide yourself and being super comfortable with the person that you’re with — so comfortable that you want to leave the lights on,” she said. “I wrote it on a day when I was feeling extra into my husband and how he makes me feel perfect in my skin.”"

But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.  “Kylie looked great but didn’t really draw any attention to her baby bump,” the source says. “She still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.”  Meanwhile, her sister Khloé Kardashian, — who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together — accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.  “Khloé was beaming all night,” the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. “She kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.”  Khloé showed off her bump on Instagram as well.  “Merry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,” Khloé captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. “I pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round. God bless you! ✨ #BabyBump🤗”  “Merry Christmas!!!!! Wishing all of you and your families much Joy Happiness Peace and Health…” Kris added in her own post, a photo of her and Khloé alongside Kendall Jenner. “Love you guys!!!!!!!! #christmas #blessed #ohholynight.”  Kim Kardashian West, Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Khloé Kardashian and Scott Disic Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Aside for Khloé and Kendall, Kris’ party also brought together siblings Kim Kardashian West (who’s expecting her third child, via a surrogate), Kourtney Kardashian, and their kids: Kim’s daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2; and Kourtney son Reign, 3, daughter Penelope, 5, and son Mason, 8.  Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too — without girlfriend Sofia Richie.  “He mingled, looked good and didn’t drink,” the source says, adding that there wasn’t any awkwardness with Kourtney’s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  “Kourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,” the insider says. “They are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn’t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.”  Other guests included Kim’s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest. Kris appeared to be in a good mood throughout the night, dancing with Kim and Khloé and playing MC while Babyface, Toni Braxton and Brian McKnight performed.  “Everyone had the most amazing time,” the source tells PEOPLE. “Kris always throws the best parties. It was all gorgeous. There was no drama.”  Rob Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  On Christmas morning, the family gathered at Kourtney’s house to open presents and celebrate the holiday in matching elf-patterned onesies and beanies.  “Merry Christmas! People think you weren’t there last night,” Khloé said to Kylie, 20, in one Snapchat video as the younger sister replied: “I was.”  “She’s a secret little bunny,” Khloé teased.  RELATED VIDEO: See the Hilarious Christmas Gift Jennifer Lawrence Gave Her ‘BFF’ Kris Jenner  Kylie has yet to confirm her pregnancy publicly. The Kylie Cosmetics owner has kept out of the public eye by sticking close to her house in Calabasas. As a source told PEOPLE in October, “Kylie wants to keep a low profile.”  “She feels good, but her body is changing,” the source continued. “She doesn’t want to be photographed. At the moment, she wants more privacy. She has family and friends come to her house instead so she has company. She’s very excited about the baby, though. She talks about the baby nonstop.”  Another insider told PEOPLE last month that Kylie is “only trusting her closest friends and her sisters right now.”  “She wants to reveal things on her own terms but she’s, of course, having fun teasing everyone,” said the insider, referring to her social media presence. “She knows all the attention is on her and her baby bump, but she won’t share until she wants to.”"
"Ariana Grande is among a number of celebrities offering thoughts and messages to the victims of terror attacks in London on Saturday night.  “Praying for London,” Grande wrote on Twitter after the incidents, which left at least seven dead and another 48 hospitalized, according to authorities. The attacks — a hit-and-run of pedestrians and multiple stabbings — occurred at two locations near the Thames River and were deemed “terrorist incidents” by local law enforcement. As reported by the Associated Press, “The incidents occurred on [London Bridge] and at Borough Market, a popular area with bars and restaurants on the south side of the bridge.” Police killed three suspects just eight minutes after the initial emergency call.  Grande is scheduled to perform Sunday in Manchester, England, at a star-studded benefit concert for victims of the Manchester terror attack that occurred following her performance in that city last month.

That retweet drew the ire of many online, including NBC News, which called out the president for passing along unconfirmed information.  “Pres. Trump has used Twitter to share news report on London incident,” the NBC News feed wrote. “We aren’t relaying president’s retweet, as the info is unconfirmed.”  Fears of new terror attack after van 'mows down 20 people' on London Bridge… — DRUDGE REPORT (@DRUDGE_REPORT) June 3, 2017  Later, President Trump tweeted, “We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!” The reference to Trump’s executive order — which Press Secretary Sean Spicer previously insisted is not a “ban” despite Trump’s words to the contrary — was criticized by many online, including MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. “Attention Supreme Court –>Now he’s calling it a travel ban again and giving you reason to uphold the lower courts’ rulings, “Scarborough wrote. “What a dope.”  We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety! — Donald J.

What a dope. https://t.co/tjuw8BCFhs — Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) June 4, 2017  The ACLU Twitter feed also took note of Trump’s use of the term “ban.”  Glad we both agree the ban is a ban. https://t.co/p1qXkffyIL — ACLU (@ACLU) June 4, 2017  In addition to his controversial tweet, Trump also pledged the country’s support to England. “Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U.K., we will be there – WE ARE WITH YOU.

"President Donald Trump says he thinks CNN’s Chris Cuomo looks like a “chained lunatic” on television. CNN’s Don Lemon is “perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting” and CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert is a “no-talent guy” who talks “filthy.”  Those were just some of the comments Trump offered over dinner Monday night when asked about the media he consumes as President of the United States. But he did little to hide his frustration, explaining that he had been surprised that the journalistic criticism had gotten worse after the campaign. He also said he had been working on tuning out news that is critical of him.  “I’ve been able to do something that I never thought I had the ability to do. I’ve been able not to watch or read things that aren’t pleasant,” he said, maintaining that he no longer watches CNN or MSNBC. “And it keeps you young.”  There was little doubt, however, that he remained acutely aware of what reporters and correspondents were saying about him. He has large flat-screen televisions set up in the Treaty Room in the White House residence and in his private dining room in the West Wing. He continues to have stacks of newspapers and magazines delivered to his office suite in the West Wing.  “Washington Post, New York Times, they’re really, really dishonest,” he said, before directly addressing the TIME reporters he had invited for dinner. “You people are quite dishonest in all fairness.” He said he used to watch MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough but no longer does. He also claimed to have helped CNN president Jeff Zucker, an old friend and business colleague, get his job at the network.  The one network he praised was Fox News, saying he watches their shows and is responsible for its ratings bump.  Spokespeople for MSNBC and CBS said the networks had no comment on the president’s criticism. A CNN spokesperson said, “His comments are beneath the dignity of the office of the President.” Trump’s claims about CNN’s Zucker have been repeatedly refuted by the executives involved.  Here’s an extended excerpt of his conversation with TIME:  For instance I don’t watch CNN. I don’t watch MSNBC. Scarborough used to treat me great. But because I don’t do interviews and stuff and want to … He went the other way. Which is fine. He’s got some problems. But I don’t watch the show anymore. It drives him crazy. I don’t watch the show. I do watch Fox in the morning, and their ratings have gone through the roof because everyone knows I’m watching Fox. But they’re pleasant. And if I do something wrong they report on it. I don’t mean they – if I do something wrong. But it’s really, honestly it’s the most accurate. CNN in the morning, Chris Cuomo, he’s sitting there like a chained lunatic. He’s like a boiler ready to explode, the level of hatred. And the entire, you know the entire CNN platform is that way. This Don Lemon who’s perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting, Don Lemon at night it’s like – sometimes they’ll have a guest who by mistake will say something good. And they’ll start screaming, we’re going to commercial. They cut him off. Remember? I’ve seen things where by mistake somebody they bring in a guest and it turns out to be a positive. And they go, I mean they get just killed. The level of hatred. And poor Jeffrey Lord. I love Jeffrey Lord. But sometimes he’s sitting there with eight unknown killers that nobody ever heard of. And CNN actually is not doing nearly as well as others. They’re all doing well because of me. But it’s not doing as well as others that are doing better actually. But Fox treats me very fairly. MSNBC is ridiculous. It’s just bad. It’s an ability I never thought I’d have. I never thought I’d have the ability to say, they’re doing a big story on me on CNN and I won’t watch it. And it’s amazing, it doesn’t matter. But it really, the equilibrium is much better. As far as newspapers and things, I glance at them. They’re really dishonest. I mean they’re really dishonest.  Trump also brought up The Late Show host Stephen Colbert’s blistering and crude May 1 monologue, in which the comedian delivered an oral-sex joke about the president and Russian President Vladimir Putin:  You see a no-talent guy like Colbert. There’s nothing funny about what he says. And what he says is filthy. And you have kids watching. And it only builds up my base. It only helps me, people like him. The guy was dying. By the way they were going to take him off television, then he started attacking me and he started doing better. But his show was dying. I’ve done his show. … But when I did his show, which by the way was very highly rated. It was high—highest rating. The highest rating he’s ever had.  Write to Zeke J Miller at zeke.miller@time.com."
"Despite reports of Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes calling it quits on a relationship that some have dated as far back as five years ago, Katie Holmes’ publicist and other sources have confirmed that the stories are not at all true.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, a rep for the actress said.  According to Page Six, the false report broke around the time that Foxx was in Atlantic City for the opening of the new Ocean Resort Casino and was filming with Mark Wahlberg the night before for his “Wahlburgers” television show.  “Jamie was telling friends he’s expecting his girlfriend Katie Holmes to join him in Atlantic City,” the source tells the publication, adding that, “Katie’s daughter, Suri, wouldn’t be coming down — because she was in summer camp.”  This contradicted Radar Online's report Wednesday about Katie calling Jamie over the phone because she “couldn’t get over her trust issues.” Radar Online would add that there was “no drama . . . just sadness when Katie called up Jamie to tell him she couldn’t do this anymore.”  Sources also say that while Foxx was at the new casino’s opening, he was at the head of a conga line of nearly 1,000 people and was directing the DJ to alternate between Prince and Michael Jackson songs. According to them, Jamie reportedly footed a bill for 100 bottles of Dom Perignon champagne. On his usual antics, the comedian, actor, and singer even got down on one knee and proposed to a 93-year old patron in the building.  “This is what it’s all about, loving everybody,” Foxx said to the sea of people."

"[Warning: This story contains spoilers from the Big Brother season finale.]  Big Brother season 19 brought a slew of blindsides, backstabbing and betrayal, and now it's time to see who won it all.  All season Paul Abrahamian was the frontrunner as he ruled the game and played puppet master to a house full of followers. So, did the season 18 runner-up pull out a win his second time around?  The answer is: no.  The finale saw Paul sit in the final three with Christmas Abbott and Josh Martinez. And Josh came out victorious in one of the most ""volatile"" seasons of the show, as host Julie Chen described it.  It was a shock to some that the Miami native walked away this season with a lot more than just meatballs, but one thing that wasn't a shock was how angry the jury felt towards Paul.  In the jury segment that was full of bitter members it was one of the most entertaining moments of the summer with a face-off between fan-favorite Mark and the one deemed as a piece of furniture by fans, Matt.  ""Very poor jury management,"" Mark said about Paul. ""I'm a bitter juror,"" admitted Elena. ""I don't respect how this season played out and I don't respect his strategies,"" said Mark. And when Alex went to cast her vote for who she wanted to win she made it clear that she was voting for who stabbed her in the front rather than the back.  Ultimately the final vote came down to both Paul and Josh's rival Cody, who ultimately voted for Josh to win the game.  As for the winner of ""America's Favorite Houseguest""? Cody just walked away $25,000 richer.  What did you think of the season 19 finale? Sound off in the comments section below."

One of the highlights of the night was a pre-taped segment where fans of the pop diva were treated to a sing-along with Grande herself to her 2014 hit “One Last Time.”  “I’m here with the one and only Ariana Grande, and we’re gonna do something really fun here in the next room,” Fallon said while standing next to a smiling Grande. “We have some of Ariana’s biggest fans, and they’re gonna do a cover thinking it’s a fan video. What they don’t know is that she’s actually right next to them, listening live, and we’re gonna surprise them.”  What followed were a lot of excited shrieks, screams, and giggles, as one by one the singer surprised each fan. Our favorite moment was when Fallon and Grande came in dancing behind a fan, removed his headphones, and upon seeing the singer, he fell to the floor in shock and joy. Grande also surprised an 11-year-old fan, the youngest one shown, who immediately started to cry and gave the superstar a huge hug. “I love you so much!” she told Grande.  In addition to surprising her lucky fans and doing her best Kendrick Lamar karaoke impression (which was pretty spot on), she also revealed that her upcoming album, scheduled for release this summer, will be entitled Sweetener."
"Good news, ladies: If you break up with Chris Evans and randomly run into him in public, he won’t make it awkward.  In the May issue of Elle magazine, the “Captain America” actor says he makes it a point to stay on good terms with his exes, and even goes in for a “big hug” when he runs into them. (We’ve never wanted to be someone’s ex more in our lives.)  “I’ve had no bad breakups in my life,” said Evans, who’s dated Kate Bosworth, Jessica Biel, and, most recently, his “Gifted” co-star Jenny Slate.  “Typically, if I see an ex, I give a big hug, and it’s wonderful to catch up,” the 35-year-old told the magazine. “If you’re ever fortunate enough to love someone and have them love you back, it’s worth protecting that. It’s rare that someone can truly know you. And if you’ve broken through that kind of wall, I think it’s important to value that.”  It sure seems like he does. The actor has spoken of Slate in only glowing terms while promoting “Gifted” the last few months. In a March interview with People, Evans called the 35-year-old actress and comedian his “favorite human.”  “She’s the best,” he said, before gushing even more. “I’ve never, ever, ever met someone in my life who has a mastery of the English language the way she does. She’ll give you one sentence and there’s no fat to it. You’re like, ‘You just chose such an unbelievable collection of words that beautifully articulate what you say.’”  The pair, who dated for nine months before breaking up in February, shared a laugh earlier this month at the Los Angeles premiere of “Gifted:”  Todd Williamson via Getty Images Such friendly exes.  They looked super cute, too:  Emma McIntyre via Getty Images  Luckily, the “no ill feelings here” approach to the breakup seems to be mutual. In a deeply revealing interview with “Vulture” last month, Slate, who’s best known for her roles in “Parks and Recreation” and the indie film “Obvious Child,” opened up about what initially drew her to Evans.  “Chris is truly one of the kindest people I’ve ever met, to the point where sometimes I would look at him and it would kind of break my heart,” she said. “He’s really vulnerable, and he’s really straightforward. He’s like primary colors. He has beautiful, big, strong emotions, and he’s really sure of them. It’s just wonderful to be around. His heart is probably golden-colored, if you could paint it.”"
"Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney revealed that she told a USA Gymnastics coach and several fellow gymnasts in 2011 that she had been sexually abused by team doctor Larry Nassar. Nothing happened, she said, and the abuse carried on for another five years.  Maroney, who won gold and silver at the 2012 Olympic Games in London as part of the “Fierce Five,” said in an interview with NBC’s Dateline that she was in a car with coach John Geddert and other gymnasts when she told them, “Last night, it was like Larry was fingering me.”  Maroney, now 22, said Geddert did not react, while the other gymnasts appeared surprised. One of the gymnasts criticized Maroney for making the statement at the time and later told NBC that the incident did not happen. Dateline reported that three other witnesses corroborated Maroney’s story.  Geddert was suspended by USA Gymnastics in January after numerous gymnasts accused him of verbal and physical abuse. Geddert has not commented on the allegations.  The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now  Maroney said Nassar abused her the first time she met him, at the Karolyi ranch in Houston, Texas, which was the U.S. national training center. She said the abuse happened every time she saw him after that — “hundreds” of times. At the world championships in Tokyo in 2011, she said Nassar “went overboard.” She told NBC that she was naked with Nassar on top of her, and “I thought I was going to die.”  Four of Maroney’s “Fierce Five” teammates have reported that they were abused by Nassar. Maroney was the first to publicly reveal the abuse, in a tweet in October 2017. She said Nassar started to abuse her when she was 13 and continued, even during the 2012 Olympic Games until she left gymnastics in 2016.  Her teammates Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, and Jordyn Wieber have also accused Nassar of sexual abuse. Raisman and Wieber are suing USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee, and Michigan State University, where Nassar was on the faculty, for failing to protect them from Nassar’s behavior.  Nassar abused the gymnasts under the pretext of medical care. An osteopath, he told the girls that the procedures would ease whatever pain they were sent to him to relieve, and would help them to continue training.  “He told me he was going to do a checkup on me and that was the first day I was abused,” Maroney said during the interview. “He said that nobody would understand this and the sacrifice that it takes to get to the Olympics, so you can’t tell people this.”  Maroney said that Nassar won the favor of the gymnasts by being friendly, bringing them food when they were afraid to eat while under the watchful eye of coaches and national team coordinator Martha Karolyi. “Your coaches are just always watching you. And wanting to keep you skinny,” she said. “I would’ve starved at the Olympics if I didn’t have him bring me food.”  Martha and Bela Karolyi respond to allegations  Martha and Bela Karolyi, the famed Romanian coaches credited with bringing U.S. women’s gymnastics to world championship and Olympic glory, spoke publicly for the first time since the accusations against Nassar were revealed last fall. They said they were not aware of Nassar’s abuse, and were saddened to learn of his behavior.  Several gymnasts have said the abuse occurred on the Karolyi ranch, which doubled as the national training center, where elite gymnasts came once a month to live and train. USA Gymnastics cut ties with the Karolyi ranch in January amid the Nassar scandal.  “Any child who is violated by Nassar, it’s a crime and it’s so sad,” Martha said. “It is very much hurtful,” Martha said of the abuse allegations. But she said she was not aware of Nassar’s sexual abuse of the gymnasts. “I heard during the testimonies that some of the parents were in the therapy room with their own child and Larry Nassar was performing this,” said Martha. “And the parent couldn’t see. How I could see?”  The Karolyis have been named in several lawsuits related to Nassar’s abuse. Nassar is currently serving 175 years in prison on state charges of criminal sexual activity and federal charges of child pornography.  Contact us at editors@time.com."
"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Gina Vivinetto  When ""Grey's Anatomy"" star Ellen Pompeo signed a $20 million deal in late 2017, she became the highest paid actress on a primetime TV drama.  But now 48-year-old Pompeo is quashing rumors that her landmark paycheck caused two of her former co-stars, Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew, to exit the series.  ""It's absolutely not true,"" Pompeo said of the chatter during her Thursday appearance on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show.""  Both actresses left the long-running ABC medical drama earlier this month, with rumors swirling that Pompeo's salary made ""Grey's"" unable to keep them on.  While Pompeo wasn't certain why Capshaw and Drew are no longer cast members, she guessed it was a creative decision on the show's part.  ""I mean, I’m not involved in these kind of decisions; however, there’s a few problems that you encounter doing a show for 14 seasons,"" she explained. ""One of them is the writers have a really hard time creatively thinking up new stories for all these characters. I think we have 16 regular cast members, and I think it’s always sad when we lose people for whatever reason.""  ""Whether they want to go or don’t want to go, it doesn’t make it any easier,"" she added.  ""Grey's Anatomy"" star Ellen Pompeo opened up about rumors that her salary caused other actresses to be fired from the series. Michael Rozman/Warner Bros.  Pompeo, an outspoken advocate for equal pay for women in Hollywood, revealed she was upset by the rumors because they create a catfight-like story where there isn't one.  ""I think that it’s important for us to not pit women against each other and to really dispel the notion that women are always victims,"" said the star. ""You don’t have to pit us against each other. We’re not enemies. We do lift each other up and support each other, and we’re not victims. We’re very strong and we’re capable of many, many things.""  Watch the discussion in the video above."

"Ever since men and women flooded the Golden Globes red carpet two weeks ago with signs of all-black sartorial solidarity and “Time’s Up” pins, there has been questions swirling around some of the men claiming to be allies of the movement against sexual misconduct. Actress Scarlett Johansson, giving her second barn-burning speech at a Women’s March in as many years, called out Globe winner James Franco on Saturday saying: “I want my pin back, by the way.”  In addition to winning a Golden Globe two weeks ago, Franco, who wore a Time’s Up pin while claiming his prize, also garnered a lot of attention thanks to some comments on social media during the ceremony including some pointed, since-deleted tweets from actress Ally Sheedy. A few days later, the L.A. Times printed a report of five women accusing Franco of sexual misconduct. Franco denied the allegations. The actor has now been publicly addressed by Johansson, one of the original signers of the Time’s Up announcement letter and a major donor to the cause.  Though she didn’t name him directly during her speech in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday, a rep for Johansson later confirmed to the L.A. Times that the actress was indeed referring directly to Franco when she said: “How could a person publicly stand by an organization that helps to provide support for victims of sexual assault while privately preying on people who have no power?” Pausing for effect, she then asked Franco for her pin back. Her comments start at the 1:25 mark.  Johansson posed further questions on much-debated topics such as abuses of power and what some deem grey areas of consent before saying she felt a “rage” bubbling up inside her on behalf of women who have been abused and also, she admitted, on behalf of herself.  Johansson then related her own personal experience: “Suddenly I was 19 again and I began to remember all the men who had taken advantage of the fact that I was a young woman who didn’t yet have the tools to say no, or understand the value of my own self-worth,” said Johansson who appeared in her first film at the age of 10. “I had many relationships both personal and professional where the power dynamic was so off that I had to create a narrative that I was the cool girl who could hang in and hang out, and that sometimes meant compromising what felt right for me.”  “No more pandering,” Johansson concluded. “No more feeling guilty about hurting someone’s feelings when something doesn’t feel right for me,” she said. “I have made a promise to myself to be responsible to my self, that in order to trust my instincts I must first respect them.”"

"This Is Us kicked off its second season last year with a bit of a stumble, courtesy of NBC: the network announced at its 2017 upfront that the show would move to Thursdays, only to backtrack two weeks later. But then the drama went on to do something that few recent breakout freshman series have accomplished: it became an even bigger hit in Season 2, where it was the highest-rated entertainment broadcast series in the adults 18-49 demographic last season, with a 5.4 rating.  After avoiding the dreaded sophomore slump, This Is Us returns tonight for Season 3, and NBC—which won’t have the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics or Thursday Night Football to help inflate it this season—will be counting on the show to help keep it on top in the 18-49 demo for what would be the third straight season.  Robert Greenblatt, in an interview before he announced yesterday that he was stepping down as NBC Entertainment chairman after seven years, said that This Is Us shows the power of broadcast TV, which is “the only place where you can gather a huge group of people together for a shared experience,” he said. “When 12 to 14 million people watch America’s Got Talent in the summer, or more than that watch This Is Us in the fall or spring, that’s an extraordinary cultural achievement.”  While Greenblatt scuttled the show’s Thursday move last year after realizing the extent to which Thursday Night Football would disrupt the show’s narrative arc, he didn’t consider relocating the show to Thursday this season, after the network lost Thursday Night Football to Fox.  “We felt, by this point, that it’s a Tuesday staple, for I’m happy to say a large part of the country. We also got some nice traction on Thursday with Will & Grace, and The Good Place is really coming into its own,” said Greenblatt. “So we thought, rather than jumble the cards again, let’s keep a good thing going on Tuesday and let’s build more of a good thing on Thursday. We’re really excited about putting [Law & Order:] SVU on Thursday at 10, which is a great thing for that night also. There’s a lot to be said for stability on your schedule.”  As for how the show was able to avoid stumbling in Season 2, “we have extraordinary writers and [creator] Dan Fogelman is just the greatest sort of visionary,” said Greenblatt. “I haven’t seen a creator who’s as far advanced in plotting a series than he is. He’s weaving in elements from seasons four, five and six, which haven’t even been completely conceived yet. But he knows where all these stories are going.”  Fogelman “knew from the beginning of the first season what the second season was meant to be: the year of what happened to [Milo Ventimiglia’s character] Jack, and his death. We had the Super Bowl [last season] and we knew early on we were going to make that the ultimate episode in the middle of the season,” said Greenblatt. “So there were a couple of things that came together that made Season 2 as anticipated as that first season was.”  NBC thinks the show’s momentum will continue this season. “I feel very bullish about Season 3 for a lot of reasons, which will remain sort of mysterious because I don’t want to give anything away,” said Greenblatt. “But there’s some extraordinary things he’s going to do this year.”"
"What do you buy the Sexiest Man Alive? Gwen Stefani opened up about her Christmas present plans for her boyfriend, Blake Shelton, with Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday night.  The 48-year-old musician had a tough time coming up with a gift for her country beau.  “He's so hard to buy for! He already has the wildebeests [on his ranch], I was gonna get him that,” Stefani said of the Oklahoma native. “But I think that, because he doesn't fit in any of my furniture at my house -- because he's too big -- I'm like, OK, I'm gonna get you a couch and that's gonna be your Christmas present. I'm putting it outside so he can [have campfires]. I try to make him feel comfortable in LA.""  As for Shelton’s beloved La-Z-Boy that was featured in his “Sexiest Man Alive” spread, Stefani quipped, “He’s going to keep that one in Oklahoma.”  The No Doubt frontwoman admitted she’s mostly responsible for this year’s cover star.  ""That is not his thing at all,” she told Fallon of the People magazine honor. “I feel responsible a little bit, because he called me, and he's like, 'I gotta talk to you about something. They want me to do this, and I hate doing photo shoots. I'm not gonna do it.' I was like, 'Why would you not do it? Your record just came out. You're gonna look back, and you're gonna regret it. Come on, just live in the moment. Everybody wants to see you do a photo shoot. I wanna see you do a photo shoot!’ And I kind of convinced him.""  It’s a busy season for Stefani, who is currently promoting her new Christmas album, You Make It Feel Like Christmas.  Opening up about her song “Christmas Eve,” Stefani revealed, “What's crazy is that Blake heard it, and he loved it so much that he decided to put it on his Christmas record and record it, which, nobody's ever recorded any of my songs, and especially not like, the hottest cowboy ever, Sexiest Man Alive.""  Stefani recently dished to ET about her Thanksgiving plans and what she’s thankful for this year. Watch the clip below to see what she said!

"Kourtney Kardashian may be 14 years older than her boyfriend.  But the reality star still believes that the 15 year age difference between her ex Scott Disick and his current girlfriend Sofia Richie is way too much.  The 39-year-old eldest Kardashian sister sill thinks the 19-year-old model is still 'too young' for her 34-year-old ex according to a source for People on Monday.

Despite the age gap, the insider insists that Sofia has had a good influence on Scott and his children: sons Mason, eight, and Reign, three, and five-year-old daughter Penelope.  'Sofia is helping Scott be a better, healthier person,' the source said. 'Kourtney feels confident that Scott and Sofia takes good care of the kids. Scott is a great dad when he has his life together.'

Meanwhile Kourtney is dating model Younes Bendjima who at 25-years-old is 14 years her junior.  This comes just weeks after Disick found public interest in his love life to be 'flattering' and that he takes the attention people pay to his personal life as a compliment.  He explained: 'I guess it's kind of flattering that people care. 'It's not like I'm mad about it. Everybody's worried about something.

But the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star insisted he doesn't harbor any fears about his kids.  Speaking to People, Scott shared: 'I don't worry about them, they're unbelievable. Best kids in the world.'  Despite this, an insider recently claimed that Sofia is fed up with Scott obsessing about his ex.  The celebrity duo have been dating since May last year, but it was suggested that Sofia is frustrated that the reality TV star appears to be so concerned with Kourtney.  The source explained: 'Sofia is annoyed with Scott's obsession with his ex Kourtney.'  In particular, the teenage star - who is the daughter of music icon Lionel Richie - has grown bored of having to listen to Scott complain about Kourtney's romance with Younes Bendjima.  The insider said: 'She's tired of listening to Scott complain about Kourtney and Sofia really doesn't like to hear Scott whine about Younes taking his place.'  It was suggested that Sofia is close to ending their relationship over the issue. The source added: 'For Sofia, it's a real turn-off when Scott stalks Kourtney online and obsesses about her, there is only so much more Sofia can take.'"
"A little more than a month after the second season of Netflix’s Ozark was released, the drama series starring, directed and executive produced by Jason Bateman has been renewed for a 10-episode third season. Chris Mundy is set to return as executive producer and showrunner.  Ozark, created by Bill Dubuque and Mark Williams, was one of the big breakouts of 2017, with its freshman season believed to be one of the most streamed shows of that summer. While the second season did not seem to match the buzz and outsized popularity of the first, Ozark remains a hit Netflix series that also gets steady awards recognition, making the Season 3 renewal a no-brainer.  In the current second season, Ozark, headlined by Bateman and Laura Linney, continues to follow Marty Byrde (Bateman) and his family as they navigate the murky waters of life within a dangerous drug cartel. With Del out, the crime syndicate sends their ruthless attorney Helen Pierce to town to shake things up just as the Byrdes are finally settling in. Marty and Wendy (Linney) struggle to balance their family interests amid the escalating dangers presented by their partnerships with the power-hungry Snells, the cartel and their new deputy, Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner), whose father Cade has been released from prison. The stakes are even higher than before and the Byrdes soon realize they have to go all in before they can get out.  Bateman directed multiple episodes from the first and second season and serves as an executive producer along with Mundy, Dubuque and Williams. Ozark is produced by Bateman’s Aggregate Films in association with Media Rights Capital."
"Mel B’s sister, Danielle Brown has decided to speak against the alleged abuse Stephen Belafonte has put his wife through after Mel got a restraining order against the man. Danielle started and entire social media war against the abuser and slammed him with her sharp words.  At first, Danielle posted on Instagram a snap meant for the media in which she assured them she never has and never will sell a story on her sister.  In order to be left alone, however, she did address the situation, later on, slamming Belafonte in another tweet: ” @stephenthinks11 8 years of abusive calls me and my mum have had stating we would never see Melanie again.I am laughing and celebrating as you were wrong. you are a sorry excuse of a man !!”  “To the left to the left everything you own in the box to the left hope you … go to jail and rot in hell!!” she added.  Her series of tweets came shortly after Belafonte also decided to open up about the situation and tell his side of the story.  Stephen denied all of Mel B’s allegations, including the ones about him beating her up and forcing her into threesomes, claiming that it is all “a smear campaign” against him.  Belafonte’s rep claimed that after legal action will be taking by the man it will be proven that Mel B lied in order to cover up her own marital misconducts. Furthermore, she tried to gain leverage with the kids’ custody by lying.  They also alleged that when the truth about the extent to which Mel B lied in the depiction of her marriage will be revealed real victims of domestic violence will be very offended by her outrageous accusations.  Advertisement  Is Belafonte innocent until proven guilty or are you convinced he did all of those horrible things to Mel B?"
"Updated: ASPEN — Senator John McCain is meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors here as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention.They gathered as Mr. McCain gave a freewheeling performance at the Aspen Institute Thursday, where he discussed the conflict in the Caucasus and challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that Mr. McCain was a flip-flopper and where he lamented his own lack of appreciation for art and music.And at a fund-raising event earlier in the day — one of three –he told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog.“That’s what I relish and that’s what I like,’’ he said at the first fund-raiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is “about the size of Senator Obama’s foreign-policy team.’’Many on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.Mr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president turned prime minister and he called the current situation between Russia and Georgia, “the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.”“My friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War,” Mr. McCain said. “This is an act of aggression. And historians and time will tell us how provoked it was or what actions the Georgian government took, et cetera. but the fact is this aggression is far exceeded any provocation that might have been inflicted on South Ossetia and Abkhazia.”Mr. McCain was by turns impassioned in defending his record and wistful about his lack of cultural education. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, “I have to be against the tax increases, as you know,” and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, it’s closer to $5 a gallon.At one point, a member of the audience accused Mr. McCain of having moved away from his “maverick” stances and challenged him on his recent statement that Mr. Obama would rather lose a war if it meant winning an election. Did he mean to say that Mr. Obama was a traitor?In a heated back and forth, Mr. McCain challenged the man, who said he was from Arizona and had voted for him, to specify the positions he had changed positions on. The man cited tax cuts and his fealty to the “Christian right.”Mr. McCain said he had not supported President Bush’s tax cuts because they were not balanced by cuts in spending but that he had supported different tax cuts. And he said he was someone who sought reconciliation, both with the likes of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Vietnamese, who had held him captive during the war.As for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a “traitor,” Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer but gave an intense response.He said he himself had been called “disloyal” by Republicans when he said the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that its strategy wouldn’t work. He said he had been “declared dead,” but he was reminded of Chairman Mao’s saying that “it’s always darkest before it’s totally black.” But, he added, Mr. Obama said the surge would fail, “he voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, he refuses to acknowledge that the surge succeeded.” He added: “I think he’s wrong and I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party,” he said, to sustained applause.He also implicitly criticized President Bush for not asking more of the nation after the 9/11 attacks. He said that by urging people to go shopping, “we passed up an opportunity” to ask them to join the Peace Corps or perform some sort of national service.He also said he opposed a military draft because it wouldn’t work. “The kind of war they’re fighting requires long-term commitment,” he said. And a draft now would probably be as unjust as it was during Vietnam, he said, when people of privilege could avoid it.On the lighter side, he joked about having once said that ABBA’s “Dancing Queen” was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank Sinatra’s “I’ve Got You Under My Skin.”He said that if he’s “lacking in anything,” it is an appreciation for music and art and “the other great things in life,” partly because he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. Then he began defending ABBA adamantly.“Everybody says, ‘I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.’How come everybody goes to ‘Mamma Mia!?’” he said. “Everybody goes! They’ve been selling out for years.”After another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development.“I appreciate art,” he declared. “If there’s one thing I’m going to do and I have the opportunity, it’s to take a class in art.” He said he had seen a lot of art in the homes of supporters recently and that his daughter had graduated from Columbia with a degree in art history. He said he loved his education at the Naval Academy, he said, “but some of the things weren’t there that I would like to see.”He then added, “But I make no excuses for my taste in music.”"

"Before Prince Harry proposed to Meghan Markle last year, he first asked for permission to do so from his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who was also required to give her formal consent before Meghan and Harry could get married this past May. But, according to royal expert Katie Nicholl, there's another very important royal in Harry's life to whom he turned for advice before popping the question: his sister-in-law, Kate Middleton . ""Harry and Kate are very close, she's been like a mentor to him and he wanted her seal of approval,"" a source told Nicholl in Grazia U.K. this week.  Beyond merely giving her approval to Harry's marriage, the Duchess of Cambridge has reportedly also made an effort to take Meghan under her wing since her and Harry's relationship turned serious. ""Kate is different to Meghan in many ways, but she has made great strides to help Meghan settle in,"" the source told Nicholl. ""It's a friendship that is still slowly blossoming. Kate has gone out of her way to be friendly to Meghan, and Meghan has been very grateful for that.""  Nicholl reports that Kate has shown Meghan ""the royal ropes ,"" introduced her to several of her favorite designers , and told the newly titled Duchess of Sussex that she's ""always welcome"" in Apartment 1A of Kensington Palace, where Kate and Prince William live with their children . ""Kate has her hands full with the children and baby, but ensures she makes time to touch base with Meghan,"" the source said.  See more: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle May Be Moving Into This Insta-Worthy Windsor Cottage  Prince Harry and Kate Middleton have long shared a special bond. Last year, in a profile of Harry, Newsweek 's Angela Levin noted that his sister-in-law had helped to ""fill some of that gap"" left by his mother Princess Diana's death. ""When she and William got engaged, Harry called her the big sister he never had. He often pops into their apartment at Kensington Palace, where she cooks him a meal—roast chicken is reportedly a particular favorite,"" Levin wrote."
"Last year, there were some awful rumors about Cate Blanchett and her husband of nearly seventeen years, Andrew Upton. Upton and Blanchett met in the 1990s, fell in love immediately and have been together ever since. They have four kids together, three sons and a baby girl, Edith, whom they adopted in 2015. They live together, they raise their children together and they work together consistently on theater projects. They were co-directors of the Sydney Theatre Company for years, and he’s written and directed theater projects for Cate many times over the years. They seemed totally solid, right?  Well, last fall, there were some photos of Upton looking and seeming especially friendly and handsy with a 27-year-old actress, a friend who has worked with him and with Cate. The photos were damning, but they weren’t definitive proof of shenanigans. Still, there seemed to be a few tense months, and Cate was even seen without her wedding ring a few times. So what’s new?  Well, Cate and Andrew are working together again. These photos are from the opening night party for The Present, Upton’s adaptation of Chekhov’s Platonov. Upton adapted the play and he’s directing it. Cate stars. They posed together happily at the Ethel Barrymore theater in New York for their opening night. Cate also made a point of posing with her costar Richard Roxburgh. Cate and Andrew’s body language says to me “we’re fine.” Or possibly “we’re fine… NOW.” As in, they had some issues but they worked their sh-t out. Possibly they worked their sh-t out when Upton got the hell out of Australia and joined Cate in America, where she’s been living and working for months now.  As for The Present, it’s getting rave reviews and Cate’s performance is being singled out, because of course it is. Theater people love her so hard. If she and Andrew ever split, so many people are going to side with her."
"On the outs with daughter Meghan Markle, Thomas Markle had hoped her mother Doria Ragland could shed some light on the situation, he said in a new interview with The Mail on Sunday.  “I even hand-delivered a letter to Doria asking her why our daughter won’t speak to me,” Thomas, 74, told the publication.  Writing to Doria, 62, is one of several ways that Thomas has tried to connect with Meghan, 37.  “I have sent several texts. Her number hasn’t changed and they haven’t bounced back,” he said of Meghan, who is expecting a baby with husband Prince Harry in the spring. “I’ve pleaded with her to pick up the phone. I wrote her a two-page letter and sent it by certified mail via her representative in Los Angeles. I asked her why she was believing the lies.”  RELATED: Christmas at Kensington Palace! See the Stunning Tree Outside William, Kate, Harry & Meghan’s Home  Meghan Markle and mother Doria Ragland in 2015 Sylvain Gaboury/Patrick McMullan/Getty Images  According to Thomas, Meghan and Harry, 34, have declined to get in touch. “I have made dozens of attempts to reach my daughter via text and letters, but she and Harry have put up a wall of silence,” he said.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I have been frozen out and I can’t stay silent,” he added.  Meanwhile, his ex-wife has remained close with Meghan as their daughter settles into royal life six months after her wedding to Harry. In September, Doria tagged along when Meghan hosted a palace lunch for the first time, and she may also celebrate Christmas with the royal family after reportedly being invited by the Queen.  After publicly wavering on the decision, Thomas did not attend Meghan’s wedding in May, citing heart problems. In his absence, Prince Charles stepped in and walked Meghan down the aisle after she “sadly” confirmed days before the nuptials that Thomas would not be attending the wedding as originally planned.  Thomas has since made controversial statements about his daughter, such as declaring that Meghan seemed “terrified” of her new duties in July and comparing the royal family to a “cult” in August. Also that month, Thomas admitted that he lied to Harry about staged paparazzi photos as the couple was preparing for their special day.  “It was very wearing on her,” a source told PEOPLE in September of the family drama that preceded the nuptials. “It’s her private life.”  Meghan Markle and father Thomas Markle Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images; Good Morning Britain/ITV  Thomas suggested that the conflict has been wearing on him, too. “My life has been turned upside down since my daughter met Harry,” he told The Mail on Sunday. “Their treatment of me is harsh, hurtful and unforgiving. I’m being punished for things I didn’t say.”"

"Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in an interview with FOX News Channel's 'Sunday Morning Futures' hosted by Maria Bartiromo, said that the Justice Department is ""aggressively"" investigating the leak of a phone call between former national security advisor Gen. Mike Flynn and the Russian Ambassador.    Background: Washington Post: How Mike Flynn Was Undone By A Phone Call    ""We’re going after this aggressively,"" Sessions said about the leak of the transcript of Flynn's call. ""I am directing it personally... and we’re pursuing it aggressively.""            Sessions also said that there are currently 27 open investigations regarding leaks of classified information. ""In the last two years before I became Attorney General there were each year there were three open investigations of classified leaks now we have 27,"" he noted.      MARIA BARTIROMO: There are felonies apparently that have already taken place. I mean we had on this program just last week, the chairman of the Intel committee Devin Nunez and he said there are felonies that are going, not looked at all they’re going by over and over listen to what he told me just last Sunday.    REP. DEVIN NUNES: The big felony in all of this that nobody talks about from the very beginning was the leak of highly classified information when they leaked the phone call of the Russian ambassador talking to General Mike Flynn right before the inauguration. That was a felony, nothing’s ever been done about it.    BARTIROMO: Is your office investigating this sir?    SESSIONS: That is a violation of the law, to leak classified documents and it is being investigated. I will say this, the last two years before I became Attorney General there were each year there were three open investigations of classified leaks now we have 27 we’re going after this aggressively. I am directing it personally, some of the matters involve this matter and some of it is a matter I am not recused on and we’re pursuing it aggressively."

"Is there a chance that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner will get back together? He has reportedly been ‘begging’ her to take him back, but we’ve got an EXCLUSIVE scoop on if he’s really looking to reunite!  Ben Affleck, 45, and Jennifer Garner, 45, broke the hearts of fans everywhere when they split in 2015. Despite some hoping they’d work it out, the two filed for divorce in April 2017. Supposedly, Ben wasn’t ready to let go, as Us Weekly reports that since they filed the papers, “he’s begged her to come back several times, but she has no interest.” Though Ben has moved on to date Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, 37, he was reportedly, at one point, telling friends he wanted his ex back.  Despite two years of trying to fix things – Jennifer “put her heart and soul into fixing the relationship and so desperately wanted to turn things around for the children’s sake, as well as theirs,” a fiend told Us – it was all in vain. Supposedly, there was a hopeful moment in 2017. After Jennifer reportedly helped Ben during his stint in rehab for alcohol abuse, a source claims he said, “He didn’t want to live without her. Things looked positive…they both wanted it to work. Though some observers thought “it was like they were together again,” it just wasn’t meant to be, and the couple went ahead with the divorce filing.  Despite this report, people shouldn’t get too excited for a happy reunion. “There is no truth here,” a source close to the exes EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com about this report. Though the source denied Ben’s “begging,” the insiders said that Ben and Jennifer “have much love and admiration for each other.”  Even Us Weekly’s report claims that Ben’s cries were falling on deaf ears. “She forgave him for such much and still he couldn’t change,” a source tells Us. “She feels it’s important to keep the peace and be a family unit,” but when it comes to romance, “she’s not going there at all.” She and Ben will still spend time together, but it will be only for the benefit of their children. “She just wants her kids to heave a healthy, happy and engaged father – and she’ll do whatever it takes to make that happen.”  [  While Ben has moved on to Lindsey, what about Jen? She’s reportedly been on a few dates – one with an “Affleck look-alike.” Jennifer is “ready to go with her feelings and give love another try. It’s no exaggeration to say that Ben broke her heart and left her in a terrible place emotionally, [but] it’s been almost three years since they called it quits. It’s time for her to move on.”"

"That's a wrap for ""Southern Charm New Orleans."" Sunday night's episode of the unscripted Bravo series marked the finale of its first season -- and, one has to believe, probably the finale of the series as a whole.  Of course, the Bravo suits could always surprise us and renew it for a sophomore season. But the fact of the matter is that the show had trouble building a steady audience from the beginning. In fact, after debuting April 25 to more than 1 million viewers, it didn't build at all, posting a viewership decline with nearly every episode, according to figures from ShowBuzz Daily.  Last week's penultimate episode marked the low-water mark, drawing fewer viewers -- 640,000 -- than any other episode so far this season. Nothing charming about that. (Viewership figures on Sunday's eighth and final episode were not available.)  By comparison, the ""Southern Charm"" mother ship, from which ""SoCharm NOLA"" was spun off, has yet to register fewer than 1 million voters in any of the nine episodes that have aired so far as part of its fifth season.  So, while there will certainly be some people who will mourn the end of ""Southern Charm New Orleans"" should Bravo decide to pass on a second season, I've got a feeling most people won't miss it -- because they apparently stopped watching pretty early on.  The reason behind the erosion of interest in the show is pretty simple to nail down: It was boring, built around limp writing and clumsily staged attempts at drama.  Granted, no reality show is actually ""real."" But if a producer wants his or her show to draw a reliable base of return viewers, they've got to help those viewers buy into the illusion. That was seldom the case with ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  If there's an upside to it all, it's that the show was not the pox on local culture that many feared. In fact, its New Orleansness seemed to get more and more watered-down with nearly every episode, eventually reduced to little more than Chamber of Commerce images flashed between scenes, with an occasional bowl of gumbo thrown in. That's just as well, given that the show's efforts at including local culture in early episodes was ham-handed at best.  Even then, though, with so few people watching, it's hard to get too terribly worked up about it. As they say: No harm, no foul.  For those few who did watch regularly, producers were kind enough to wrap up most of the show's loose narrative threads in Sunday's finale. Below find a recap of the high points (and low points) of the Season 1 finale of ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  The title: ""Better Late Than Pregnant.""  The centerpiece drama of the week: In what was perhaps the show's cheapest stunt yet -- and its most manufactured -- producers pulled a full-on okey-doke on viewers, in the form of a pregnancy scare for cast member Reagan Charleston.  That particular plot point was teased during the closing moments of the previous episode, but before getting to it in Episode 8, producers had hubby Jeff Charleston express his eagerness to become a father -- followed by Raegan informing him that she's not quite ready yet to be a mom. The next thing we know, her period is conveniently late.  So, she does what anybody would do: She takes a pregnancy test. At a huge season-ending party thrown by fellow cast member Jon Moody. And using a pregnancy test that was a gag gift at an adult Easter egg hunt from Episode 7.  And after all that? Spoiler alert: She ain't preggers.  That's right, ""Southern Charm New Orleans"" fans. You just got punk'd.  In all honestly, it's probably for the best, as on Monday (June 4) -- the day after the finale aired -- Reagan and Jeff announced they are separating.  The libation of the week: A French 75, ordered at breakfast by Tamica Lee.  The New Orleans cliche of the week: From a practical standpoint, the idea of throwing a party to end the season was a pretty good one, giving producers the opportunity to get everybody together one last time -- and decked out in their Sunday best -- to wrap up the season's myriad dramas.  That being said, it's nothing short of shameless that they framed it as a ""Jazz Fest launch party."" The show, and the episode has nothing to do with Jazz Fest. The cast never went to Jazz Fest. In fact, music has played a minor role in the series at best.  The honest question of the week: Speaking of the show's lack of focus on music, why didn't producers pick a local musician or two when they were casting the show? Not only would they have gotten some great music out of it, but the real behind-the-scenes dramas that play out on the local music scene have got to be better than the fake ones that played out on Season 1 of ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  If there's one thing that could get me interested in a second season, that would probably be it.  The real moment of the week: Of all the lose threads tied up in the season finale, easily the most touching was the reconciliation between cast member Tamica Lee and her daughter, third-grader Rani, with whom she butted heads in a previous episode -- and who has struggled with the fact that she's the only black kid at her school.  After sitting down for a heart-to-heart with the help of supporting cast member Susan Henry, Tamica and Rani hugged it out -- and cried it out -- in what was probably the sweetest moment of the season.  Granted, it all happened during a staged radio interview at local station WBOK, but this is one case where the end justifies the means. On a related note: If there's an MVP of the season, it's Rani, as far as I'm concerned.  The manufactured moment of the week: Raegan's pregnancy scare. (See ""The centerpiece drama,"" above.)  The quote of the week: ""We're just having some conversations."" -- Justin, to mother Dottie Reese, after she walked in on a heated conversation between Justin and girlfriend Kelsey.  I don't know why, but that line cracked me up. In fact, it's not just the quote of the week. It might be the quote of the whole season. I'm think I'm going to start using it whenever anybody butts into a conversation I'm having with somebody else.  Them: ""What are you guys talking about?""  Me: ""We're just having some conversations."" (Exits.)  The winner: The King Firm, where cast member Justin Reese's day job is. Every episode this season, they've bought airtime during the show for a commercial that prominently features Justin -- and which never fails to fool me into thinking the show is back on, thus prompting me to stop fast-forwarding through the commercials.  Granted, I start fast-forwarding again immediately upon realizing it's a commercial, but I know the firm's name now, whereas I didn't' before.  Nicely played, King Firm. Nicely played.  The loser: Me, for actually sitting through all eight episodes.  On the plus side, it's all been documented through the following stories, so future generations can remember the season that was.  As for me, I'm going to start trying to forget it, starting now.

"Showtime’s Homeland will wrap after its upcoming eighth season, according to the show’s star Claire Danes. As The Hollywood Reporter reports, the actress confirmed the news during an interview with Howard Stern on Sirius XM on Wednesday.  “Yeah, that’s it,” Danes said when Stern addressed the rumors that next season would bring the CIA drama to a close. A representative for Showtime told Rolling Stone that the network has not made a decision beyond Season 8.  Danes said she felt “really conflicted” about the series ending. “I’ll be ready,” Danes said. “She’s a lot, this Carrie fricking Mathison. I mean, she’s under constant duress. I mean, it’s a workout.  “So, I’ll be ready for a reprieve from that,” she continued. “But, you know, I’ve never done anything this long.”  Showtime renewed Homeland for an additional two seasons ahead of its Season 6 premiere.  “It’s definitely going to be my last year,” executive producer and writer Alex Gansa told THR in February, before the show’s seventh season debut. “I can’t speak for Claire or Mandy [Patinkin], but it will be my final year and it will be designed to be the end of an eight-season story. If Showtime, Fox, Claire and Mandy want to take the show further, that’s their decision. And we would leave some room for that to happen, if there’s an appetite.”  The Season 7 finale airs on April 29th. Homeland has garnered 10 Primetime Emmy Awards, including Danes winning two for best actress in a drama series."
"Actor Robert Pattinson recently sat down with The Telegraph to discuss his new film Good Time. Besides that, he also talked about his mental health, fame and ongoing therapy as well.  Also read: Did Robert Pattinson breakup with FKA Twigs because of Katy Perry?  Asked if fame and mental health issues are connected, the 31-year-old English actor responded, ""Yes. Definitely. Pretty much every person I know who's got famous is completely nuts. It's just isolation and also the repetitiveness of your interactions with people... It's just weird.""  But he also explained how he maintained his own sanity. ""I had good agents and stuff and I've had really good friends since the beginning.""  ""So I think when it gets dangerous for people is when you have no friends and you think, 'Oh, if I get strangers to love me then it will fill that hole.' And then when it doesn't fill the hole, then you go 10 times crazier,'"" he said.  Adding, ""I try to not be seen whatsoever between movies. So hopefully the only thing that exists of you in the public realm is what you agree to put out there.""  Talking about his mental condition, he admitted that he was really crazy earlier. ""It's always just a control thing. If the control of your life has been taken away from you, that's when you go a little crazy.""  ""I get so much anxiety in performance and everyone's reaction is to say, 'Just be yourself!' And myself, in general, is the last person I want to be."" Pattinson told The Telegraph.  During the interview, the Twilight actor also revealed that his parents became ""literally horrified"" when they learned about him being under therapy.  Talking about therapy, the actor also mentioned how therapy still remains as a 'weird stigma'. However, he also confessed how he has got a lot out of the counselling.  ""You're just trying to figure out how you feel about something. I've got a lot out of it... I mean [without therapy], I don't know how you're supposed to do [life]."""
"Meghan Markle’s nephew has announced details of the special strain of cannabis he has created to celebrate the upcoming royal wedding.  Tyler Dooley grows cannabis in Oregon, US – which has been legal in the American state since 2015 – and previously announced that he would be developing a new potent hybrid named Markle’s Sparkle.  Now, days before Markle is due to marry Prince Harry, details of the drug’s price, flavour and effects have been released on Leaf Buyer – an online cannabis dispensary database.  In an online description of Markle Sparkle, the website says: “Noble families often inspire their country persons to craft and dedicate products to them.  “For a Royal baby, a royal cheddar. For a Royal wedding, a royal weed.  “Markle Sparkle is a cannabis strain dedicated to the soon-to-be British Royal Meghan Markle.”  The $150-an-ounce (£111) strain is tipped to be good for helping alleviate insomnia, pain and anxiety, and it has been specially engineered so that it doesn’t make users feel too hungry.  The website also says that Markle Sparkle has a “very sweet, silky taste” with “notes of fresh blueberry and a unique, fruity and smooth flavour.”  As for its effect, the drug is supposed to provide users with an “uplifting” experience and a “tingling body sensation.”  “There is a sense of relief and euphoria that comes with the high as well,” it says.  “These benefits make for a great all-around versatile strain for any medical patient or recreational consumer.”  The Markle Sparkle tests at 23 per cent THC - the active ingredient in marijuana – and is made by crossbreeding three varieties including NYC Diesel, Northern Lights with Blueberry and a secret strain which Dooley is not revealing.

According to the Daily Mail, the new drug has already won the praise of marijuana industry newspaper High Times.  Its spokesman Jon Cappetta has said: “If the quality of the strain matches the hype over its name, Markle Sparkle has the potential to be very lucrative.  “Title strains like Blue Dream, Sour Diesel, or OG Kush are sought out by name across the world, and in turn can command higher rates.  “These are decades old strains we're talking about.

"A striking first image from “Judy” shows Renee Zellweger playing show business legend Judy Garland in a biopic from Pathé, BBC Films and Ingenious Media. Principal photography is now underway on the picture, which is being shot in London. The movie is set in the late 1960s as Garland arrives in the British capital for a run of sell-out concerts.  As well as Zellweger in the lead role, the cast includes Jessie Buckley (“War and Peace”), Finn Wittrock (“American Horror Story”) and Michael Gambon (“Harry Potter”).  Garland’s dates at the Talk of the Town nightclub came toward the end of the icon’s long career and shortly before her death. The movie will recount her performances, with some of her best-known numbers, including “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.”  The film also delves into Garland’s behind-the-scenes battles with management, her relationships with musicians and fans, and the unfolding family drama that provided the backdrop to the London performances. She died in London in June 1969.  “Judy” is a Pathé, BBC Films and Ingenious Media presentation of a Calamity Films Production. Executive producers include Cameron McCracken for Pathé, Rose Garnett for BBC Films and Andrea Scarso for Ingenious.  British stage director and Tony nominee Rupert Goold is directing “Judy” from a script by Tom Edge (“The Crown”). BAFTA winner David Livingstone (“Pride”) produces for Calamity Films.  Pathé is distributing “Judy” in the U.K., France and Switzerland and will handle sales throughout the rest of the world.  POPULAR VIDEO ON VARIETY"
"Selena Gomez refuses to talk to her mother about her on-again off-again relationship with Justin Bieber.  The 'Come And Get It' singer's rollercoaster romance with the 'Sorry' hitmaker is said to have ended recently, but her mother Mandy Teefey has suggested she would be the last one to know what the situation is right now.  Tense: Selena Gomez refuses to talk to her mother about her on-again off-again relationship with Justin Bieber  Asked by E! News for an update on her 25-year-old daughter's relationship with the 24-year-old pop star, she simply replied: 'You would know before I did. We don't talk about it.'  It comes after reports claiming despite the apparent split, Justin still has his former flame on his mind.  An insider told People: 'He isn't dating. He thinks and talks about Selena all the time. The chapter with her is definitely not finished.'  On-again, off-again: Selena's mother doesn't approve of Justin Bieber  Although he has made an effort to develop a better relationship with Selena's friends and family - but they're not convinced he's a suitable boyfriend.  The insider added: 'Justin does care what her friends and family think and has tried to win them over, but some of them are just over it. They're there for Selena and support her no matter what, but don't feel like they need to welcome back Justin.  'If you notice, Selena keeps her friends and Justin separate - when she's with Justin, it's just Justin, and when she's with her old friends, it's just them. They don't really overlap anymore.'  Selena's mother has previously questioned whether Justin, 24, is a suitable boyfriend for her daughter.  And the 'Wolves' hitmaker is said to be focused on rebuilding her relationship with Mandy.  The source told Entertainment Tonight: 'She wants to repair her relationship with her mother, that's a priority for her, too.'"

"Those impatient with high-end Britfilm period product might worry that this movie takes a rather picturesque view of disability issues, and for the first 20 minutes I came pretty close to this standpoint myself. But you have to give Breathe time to let its charm and its heartfelt decency grow on you. The film is about an important figure in the history of how we think about and respect disabled people – the wheelchair-use pioneer and polio survivor Robin Cavendish (whose son Jonathan is the movie’s producer).  Andy Serkis makes his debut as director, working from a robust screenplay by William Nicholson. Andrew Garfield plays Cavendish, a rather dashing fellow in the 1950s who zooms around the place in his sports car and plays a splendid game of cricket, hitting a six that breaks the teacups set out by the clubhouse and roguishly calling out: “Sorry!” He spots a beautiful young woman among the spectators: Diana Blacker, played by Claire Foy. It’s love at first sight, and marriage soon afterwards, and then a rather memsahib-like existence for her in Kenya (pronounced Keen-ya) because Cavendish is a “tea broker” there.  But then one day Cavendish feels faint and collapses: he has polio, is paralysed from the neck down, and after he is brought back to England, the medical establishment curtly tells Diana not to expect her husband to live any more than a few months, and only as a prostrate patient who must be passive and obedient. But armed with love and courage, the Cavendishes demand more of existence than this, and Robin defies the grumpy doctors by using a new respirator-wheelchair invented especially for him. It is possible that for this role, Garfield studied Kenneth More playing the disabled Air Force pilot Douglas Bader in the biopic Reach for the Sky.  It’s a valuable and touching story, and it is extraordinary to think that so recently, disabled people in this position were treated like living corpses, there to be clinically warehoused and studied, and told to be grateful and mute. There is a chilling scene in which Cavendish and his friends are taken to see a facility in Germany that turns out to be some Kubrickian living morgue: white, brightly lit, with patients entombed in state-of-the-art medical sarcophagi.  As for the central relationship, it is a matter of getting on with it, keeping love alive in the little things and staying cheerful in a very British way – which I’m sure is a fair depiction of exactly how the Cavendishes coped. There is a delicate allusion to what might be called their conjugal intimacy – Robin says it is a matter of Diana “doing all the work” – although the business of other bodily functions is not shown. The lump-in-the-throat seriousness is offset with fun small roles, principally for Tom Hollander, who plays both Diana’s twin brothers and provides some much-needed irony and cynicism. Hugh Bonneville has some fun with the role of scientist Teddy Hall, who invents Robin’s wheelchair.  The problem is that there is not much light and shade in the Cavendishes themselves – and certainly not with Diana, at times a rather thankless role for Foy (given far less to chew on here than as the Queen in the Netflix series The Crown). She is loyal, loving, often exasperated and sometimes angry – but it is still a pretty narrow emotional bandwidth. Robin has his own dark night of the soul, just after he is told that he will not walk again, but it is always clear that this bitterness is only temporary.  And those who wonder if the British film industry will tackle the issue of Kenya and the Mau Mau uprising may not be entirely happy with the way that is invoked: a rather saucer-eyed anecdote around the Kenyan camp-fire about Mau Mau prisoners choosing a Zen-willed suicide for themselves in detention camps. Most accounts suggest Mau Mau prisoners died rather more brutally than that, yet this quaint image is later revived to evoke Robin’s own stoicism when his own condition becomes too much to bear.  At all events, Breathe is an affecting account of the quiet courage needed to battle the deadly spores of discrimination and condescension that came with polio."
"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History – despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)  Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online.  In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes.  That changed dramatically the following month.  Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before.  Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.”  “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.”  And viewers did, apparently.    Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst)  Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.”  “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said.  Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company.  Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)  [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly]  But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales.  “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.”  Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.  [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?]  Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported.  The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain.  On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel.  “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.”  [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’]  Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a law school graduate and member of the D.C. Bar — partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump’s products.  According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses.  “We’ve never seen such a large uptick,” Tanner said. “Typically, she’s not in our top 100 sellers.”  Comparing February’s numbers with last year’s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.)  The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company’s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.  [Watchdogs ask U.S. attorney to investigate Trump over foreign business deals]  The Ivanka Trump brand also appears to have weathered an aggressive boycott campaign called Grab Your Wallet, which began in October and encouraged shoppers to avoid retailers that stock Trump-branded products.  1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Ivanka Trump: A life in the spotlight View Photos Here’s a look at Ivanka Trump’s early life of privilege and transformation into a business executive, first daughter and adviser to the U.S. president.

Some retailers have partially or completely distanced themselves from the Trump brand. Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Belk have stopped selling Trump’s branded line of clothing, shoes and jewelry. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have instructed employees to stop promoting Trump products in stores and to move Trump clothing into general merchandise racks. Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart discontinued online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection last month, though their websites still contain items sold by third-party sellers. The collection includes living room and bedroom furniture, lamps and chandeliers.  The companies attributed their decisions to product performance. Nordstrom, for instance, said sales of the brand have steadily declined, particularly in the last half of 2016.  Still, despite the boycott, Trump’s line of fragrances enjoyed top spots in Amazon’s best-selling list last month, The Post’s Amy B Wang reported. The Ivanka Trump Eau de Parfum spray was the top-selling item in the “Perfumes & Fragrances” category.

We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together. Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now. There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision — just two best-friends realizing it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible. We are still a family and will always be loving dedicated parents to Everly. We won’t be commenting beyond this, and we thank you all in advance for respecting our family’s privacy. Sending lots of love to everyone, Chan&Jenna.”  The actors, both 37, have one child together — daughter Everly — who will turn 5 in May.  The couple most recently attended the Kids’ Choice Awards together where Tatum hit the stage to promote his new animated movie Smallfoot.  They first met on the set of their 2006 movie Step Up and began dating shortly after before tying the knot in 2009.  Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan have split. The last attended a red carpet together in November (pictured) Greg Doherty/Getty  Buzz about a split began when Dewan Tatum attended the annual Vanity Fair Oscars after-party solo, but she told ET at the bash that Tatum was on daddy duty and “so happy to have a night off.”  And in mid-March the former couple shared sweet snaps from a face painting session with their daughter. “When you fall asleep around a toddler,” Dewan Tatum captioned a silly shot of Tatum before sharing a solo selfie of her own look.

Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum Channing Tatum/Instagram  In February, the actress opened up to Health about the perception that she and Tatum had a “perfect life,” saying instead that they worked hard to keep their relationship going.  “When people say you guys have such a perfect life, I want to scream and tell them no one’s perfect,” she said. “I think there are such things as great fits. It is a great fit as long as you are growing together, and I think up until this point we’ve really grown together. Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa.”  Dave Benett/WireImage  Dewan Tatum said while they always made sure to make time for one another, they still had days where they didn’t get along.  “But I think a couple needs to be conscious and to want to do the work and be willing to look at the parts of you that need work. Both of us have been pretty aware and willing to do that,” she continued. “We’ve always had the same values. But we’re not perfect! Are you kidding? We fight like other couples, we disagree about things, we have days where we don’t really like each other.”  RELATED VIDEO: Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan ‘Have Lovingly Chosen to Separate’ After Nearly 9 Years of Marriage  In December, Tatum wished his wife a happy birthday with a heartfelt Instagram post.  “This creature is one more year beautiful. The transformation she invoked this year has been something they only write about in books of fairytale and magic. Your strength and grace ever-evolving,” he wrote. “By doing so you make everything around you grow- everything. And I am so very grateful for your lessons. Happy life day my love.”"
"“I love romantic comedies. I feel almost sheepish writing that, because the genre has been so degraded in the past twenty years or so that admitting that you like these movies is a form of mild stupidity… I enjoy watching people fall in love on-screen so much that I can suspend my disbelief for the contrived situations that only happen in the heightened world of romantic comedies.” —Mindy Kaling, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?  At the end of its second season, The Mindy Project has become one of those shows that inspires strong reactions on either side, and very few in the middle. If you scout out Mindy Project reviews (wait, I’ve done it for you!), you’ll find both total pans (“The Mindy Project fails at everything it attempts”) and complete raves (“Why only an idiot would miss out on TV’s funniest comedy”). I fall closer to the latter on the scale, but I understand the former. I don’t really care if Mindy’s likable or not, as long as she’s entertaining, but some of her actions are insane (tracing her one-night stand to his workplace, a first-grade classroom) or ignorant (a medical doctor who doesn’t know what “condo” stands for?) enough to take the viewer out of the actual show to ponder, “Why am I watching this person?” When the show does stumble (“L.A.,” or the recent ill-scheduling of “Girl Crush”), it takes at least a week or so to right itself.  Advertisement  But when it realigns, The Mindy Project becomes one of the most enjoyable comedies on TV. Todd VanDerWerff points out that although the show seems to be in a constant state of transition, at least its trajectory is skewing upward, with a big leap forward between this season and last. I would probably watch it for the one-liners and absurdist asides (like the stalker raccoon) alone, but I also appreciate Mindy Kaling’s overall mission: To draft her own brand of romantic comedy. From the show’s first episodes, it established that Dr. Mindy Lahiri only wants to be Meg Ryan in a movie with Tom Hanks, as idealistic and unrealistic as that sounds. Her real-life counterpart has studied these rom-com tropes as well, so nods to the Nora Ephron canon (like “You’ve Got Sext”) abound in her scripts. She’s writing within the mold while redefining it: The saga of Mindy and Danny has contained some of the show’s finest work, as a hot in-air kiss led to a short yet delightful relationship, a too-quick and devastating breakup, and a hesitant walk toward each other again.  Heading into the finale, I fully expected Mindy and Danny to end up together (the episode title is a dead giveaway), but wondered how Kaling would make it memorable, meaningful, and most of all, funny. Fortunately, she pulled off this particular hat-trick. The episode features an absolute treasure trove of hilarious lines (I could list them all in stray observations, but that would be this entire review) strewn throughout the plot that finally brings Mindy and Danny together. This storyline not only utilizes the entire supporting cast for once (Zoe Jarman, we hardly knew ye), but it also uses Kaling’s rom-com curation as an actual plotting device. Pile on devastating performances by Kaling and Chris Messina, especially, and you have one of my favorite episodes of the year.  Danny pretending to be Mindy’s mysterious train admirer honors You’ve Got Mail, but also The Shop Around The Corner, the movie on which it was based. He knows her well enough to know that the promise of perfect romance will be enough to make her dump her real relationship with Detective Charlie. Danny suggests they meet on the top of the Empire State Building—add An Affair To Remember by way of Sleepless In Seattle—where he will reveal that he has loved her all along. After a slight derail, he visits her when she’s sick (You’ve Got Mail again), while offering to watch the ultimate film study in friendship-leading-to-romance: When Harry Met Sally (He: “I’ll order whatever gave her an orgasm!” She: “You paraphrased one of the most famous lines pretty well!”). Then, in a Danny voiceover, he takes her all over New York, “visiting any place that Meg Ryan ever laugh-cried.”  Advertisement  I cite Messina’s performance because although he tells Morgan and Tamra and Mindy his true feelings this episode, he has not voiced them since the breakup. But for the last four or five episodes, we still have known—by his frequent smoldering looks, attempts to work his way back into Mindy’s life, and just his ready acceptance to go get breakfast with her and be late for work.  When the entire office staff gets pulled in to lead Mindy and Danny back to each other, it works so well I wish they’d been used more throughout the entire season. Morgan has always been the office’s unsung MVP, as he figures out Danny’s secret plan (Danny asks, “How did you figure it out?”, then realizes he’s talking to Morgan: “How did you figure it out?”). Jeremy was awesome with his waivers, as was Peter with his final pep talk this season as he proves to Mindy that Danny still loves her.  So Mindy and Danny both race to the Empire State, and in one of my favorite bits of the episode, Danny gets hit by a car, yet still hobbles off. This is a hilarious nod to An Affair To Remember (which I will not spoil in case you haven’t seen it, but really, you should see it). Danny and Mindy reunite, and all is right with the sitcom world.  Advertisement  It’s such a perfect finale, I almost wish the show hadn’t been renewed. But then there would be no more Mindy Project, which would be a real disappointment. That’s the thing about rom-coms: The ending is always the same. But Mindy and Danny’s journey to get there was such an enjoyable trip. The challenge for season three will be to keep the momentum going into Danny and Mindy’s actual relationship, without contrived breakups or third-party romantic obstacles. This finale points to the possibility that The Mindy Project could pull it off.  Finale grade: A  Season grade: B  Stray observations:  On the train, Mindy’s coworkers are having a boring conversation about street mimes: “Mimes don’t even talk!”  For the record, Katie Holmes is six months older than Mindy Kaling.  I fervently hope Tim Daly is on the list for Emmy-nominated guest stars this year. Even his final scene is killer: He chastises Mindy for describing herself as a prostitute again (she shakes her head and agrees, “I know, I know”), then walks out of their breakup like a boss without ever acknowledging that he may have any flaws. I miss him already.  Loved Morgan’s dawning look of realization about Mindy’s “Mindy2ndaccount@hotmail” email address. And his sarcastic nods to Danny about honesty.  Also, Beverly covering her ears so she won’t have to hear Jeremy’s catfish story about the man with no torso again.  The title of Danny’s fake emails to Mindy: “what if… ,” “hello,” “today,” “coffee,” “good times.”  Morgan explains why Mindy should know Danny loves her: “He laughs at all of your jokes, and let’s face it, comedy is not your strong suit.”  The elevator guy sends Mindy up 104 floors seconds before the elevators start working again.  “You’re killing me, Bradley Cooper! What is this, a 20-piece suit?”  “Danny, who did I mail my underwear to?”  I starting reviewing The Mindy Project about midway through this season; I was not a huge fan of the show’s early episodes, but by the time Adam Pally showed up, it began to win me over. It was a lot of fun to write about; thanks for reading!"

"As Kanye West focuses on his music after a series of explosive tweets and interviews, Kim Kardashian admits she didn’t realize just how deeply much her ordeal being held at gunpoint during the 2016 Paris robbery affected her husband.  Appearing on Live with Kelly and Ryan on Friday, the mom of three admitted she wasn’t fully aware of the anxiety plaguing the rapper.  “Not really, because he always is so strong,” she said. “Obviously he made a lot of changes with our security detail … but as far as emotionally, he always was really strong, and my rock.”  Evan Agostini/Invision/AP  RELATED GALLERY: From John Legend to Ava DuVernay: All the Celebs Who’ve Weighed In on the Kanye West Drama  “Now I can read the reports of what the people in jail said … they said they had been following me for two years, and that’s crazy,” she added. “There was a couple dozen people involved, so they definitely were such a machine that they figured out when he wasn’t going to be there.”  Kardashian, 37, was robbed in her Paris hotel room in October 2016 by masked men who tied her up while they stole two cellphones and approximately $10 million worth of jewelry, including a $4 million ring.  In January 2017, French police charged 10 people in connection with the robbery, and they arrested another suspect in April.

I always said, even with the robbery, when I got all my family members on the phone … I was like, ‘You guys, thank god this wasn’t you. You would be messed up for the rest of your life,'” she said. “I’m mentally really, really strong and it gets me through so much.”  Lately, West, 40, has been making headlines for suggesting slavery is “a choice,” forging a controversial alliance with President Donald Trump and revealing that he suffered from an opioid addiction after becoming dependent on the pain medications following a liposuction procedure in 2016.

"Original Charmed stars Holly Marie Combs and Shannen Doherty have already addressed The CW’s upcoming reboot. Now the third sister is sharing her thoughts.  “I wish that they would have come to us and we would have been involved since the beginning,” Alyssa Milano said during an interview with Entertainment Tonight. “But having said that, I do hope that it reaches the newer generation and impacts that generation the way ours was able to do for its generation.”  The CW greenlit the self-described “fierce,” “funny,” “feminist” reboot with Sarah Jeffery, Melonie Diaz, and Madeleine Mantock as three sisters who discover they’re actually witches. They must then try to balance their life in a college town with supernatural demon-hunting.  Milano costarred with Combs and Doherty in the original series. Rose McGowan came on as long-lost half sister Paige when Doherty’s Prue character was killed off.  Combs, especially, has been very vocal about the reboot. “Let me say first that I appreciate the jobs and opportunities the Charmed reboot has created,” she wrote, in part, through a statement. “But I will never understand what is fierce, funny, or feminist in creating a show that basically says the original actresses are too old to do a job they did 12 years ago. I hope the new show is far better than the marketing so the true legacy does remain.”  Doherty had also tweeted initially that the concept was “offensive.” She added, “I love Charmed. I also want it to be respected. I’m simply choosing to be constructive about it because negativity has no place in my life.”  Yep. You nailed it. Their wording is terrible and a bit offensive. But, everyone makes mistakes. Perhaps with the backlash they will be more thoughtful in future. — Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 27, 2018  Thank you. I love charmed. I also want it to be respected. I’m simply choosing to be constructive about it because negativity has no place in my life. — Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 27, 2018  The new stars and producers have responded to the pushback, also coming from certain pockets of the original fans, multiple times. During the Television Critics Association tour, Mantock said, “Of course, you can’t help but feel disappointed because I think the script is fantastic. I really hope maybe [Combs will] see it and like it.”  Executive producers Jennie Snyder Urman and Jessica O’Toole also noted how the original show “wrapped up everything up so wonderfully” and they “didn’t want to mess with that mythology, obviously, because it was eight years.”  “None of us from the original cast to the original creators, producers, or writers have anything to do with it,” Milano said in a recent interview with Parade. “The way I feel about it is this, and I’ll just be super, super-honest: If the reboot can give the joy that it gave to our generation to a new generation, then I think that’s really beautiful. Time after time, I’ve heard story after story about how that show meant so much to people, because it was a show that they found while they were battling cancer, or it was a show that they watched with their father, and that was the only thing they could connect with. It really resonated with people in a profound way, and if a new generation can find that, then I think that’s really beautiful.”  She suggests the new showrunners “shouldn’t try to reinvent the wheel, but really take what was so great about the original and find a way to make it their own.”  “I’m just glad that it’s here finally, because we’ve been hearing about this reboot for however many years, what has it been, maybe four years now?” she added. “And I feel like it’s either going to succeed or not, and if it succeeds again, a whole new generation will be exposed to the beauty of what Charmed was able to be for people, and if it doesn’t succeed, then we don’t have to hear about it anymore.”"
"Justin Bieber has had his fair share of accidents in public — most of them involving high-profile falls while on tour.  So when the 22-year-old pop star was seen walking down the streets of West Hollywood, Los Angeles on Thursday with a giant wet stain on the crotch of his designer sweatpants, the Internet obviously just assumed Bieber had peed himself. (Yes, #JustinPeeber was a thing.)  But the “Love Yourself” singer has a totally reasonable explanation.  Late in the evening on Thursday, Biebs set the record straight about the source of the stain. “Someone got me flowers and I was driving, made a turn, and the water spilled on my d— area,” he tweeted.  While most celebrities might have been peed-off about the embarrassing photos, Bieber has a good sense of humor about it.  “Didn’t bother me if it made ya laugh nice!” he added.  Source: Justin Bieber Twitter  He also took to his newly reinstated Instagram to joke about the photos, posting a meme comparing his soaked sweatpants to the wet pants Adam Sandler rocked in Billy Madison.  “You ain’t cool unless you pee your pants,” Bieber wrote — quoting the scene from the 1995, in which Sandler pretends to pee his pants to so that school bullies will stop teasing another kid who actually did pee his pants.

After Halsey recently dissed Iggy Azalea in the press, the Aussie rapper isn't looking to escalate anything things into a beef.  Speaking with Australian radio show Smallzy's Surgery, Azalea called Halsey's comments to The Guardian last week ""strange"" since they were seemingly totally unprovoked.  ""It's a bit weird to bring someone up in an interview that you weren't asked about,"" said Azalea, likening it to if she suddenly decided to diss Janet Jackson during that conversation without reason.  ""To me, because I'm a famous person and I know a lot of the time people have opinions and they're not always accurate, I really try very hard not to give my personal opinions about people that I don't know,"" Azalea continued. ""And I don't know her, I've never met her.""  In an interview published last week, Halsey targeted Azalea as someone she would never put on one of her records. Of Azalea, the singer said, ""She had a complete disregard for black culture. F---king moron. I watched her career dissolve and it fascinated me.""  In response, Azalea told Smallzy, ""I thought it was a bit of a strange thing to throw that out there, but she's young and I hope she learns maybe to be a bit less judgmental when she's kind of in the same shoes. I'm sure she's getting judged all the time as well by people who don't really know her. So I think maybe it'd be good for her to try to be a little more empathetic to other people that are in the same situation.""  Listen to the full interview here."
"It’s official: Last Man Standing will be back. A year after it was canceled by ABC, Fox has closed deals to bring back the multi-cam comedy starring Tim Allen for premiere during the 2018-2019 season.  The bulk of the show’s core cast is back, including Allen, Nancy Travis, Jonathan Adams, Amanda Fuller, Christoph Sanders and Jordan Masterson. I hear co-star Hector Elizondo also has a deal in place to come back. His casting is currently in second position to his NBC comedy pilot Guess Who Died which is not expected to go forward at the network.  As Deadline previously reported, LMS producer 20th Century Fox TV had been in talks with sibling Fox Broadcasting Co. for a new season of the series, which will be its seventh, with Allen locked in to return. The series is eyed for a new multi-camera comedy block on Friday.  Created by Jack Burditt, Last Man Standing stars Allen as Mike Baxter, a married father of three girls, who tries to maintain his manliness in a world increasingly dominated by women.  Allen has been vocal about his disappointment over the cancellation of Last Man Standing by ABC and his hope to see it come back.  “Excited?,” he said today. “Team LMS was in the sixth inning, ahead by four runs, stands were packed and then for no reason, they call off the game. It leaves you sitting in the dugout, holding a bat and puzzled. Now we get the news from Fox that it’s time to get back out on that diamond – hell yes, I’m excited!  When I heard the offer to create more episodes of Last Man Standing, I did a fist pump so hard I threw my back out. It’s the fans! I could not be more grateful for the fans who wrote petitions and kept up the passion and incredible support for the show,” he continued. “And a fist pump, ouch, for Dana Walden and Gary Newman at Fox for not only listening to the fans, but for making the bold move to bring Last Man Standing back. I’m sure audiences will be curious to see what we look like after all these years. Oh, has it only been one year? Well, just goes to show you – a lot can happen in a year.”  Last Man Standing was ABC’s second most-watched comedy, after Modern Family, averaging 8.3 million viewers in Live + 7 for the 2016-2017 season. Among the key Adults 18-49 demographic, the series averaged a 1.7/7. The series ranked as the No. 1 new program across all syndication when it debuted off-net during the 2016-2017 season.  “Last Man Standing ended too soon and the outcry from the fans has been deafening,” said Gary Newman and Dana Walden, Chairmen and CEOs, Fox Television Group. “We’ve wanted to put the show back together since its final taping a year ago, and Tim never gave up hope either. Thanks to its millions of devoted viewers and the irrepressible Tim Allen, we haven’t seen the last of Last Man Standing.”  Fox actually seriously considered rescuing Last Man Standing last May, following its surprise cancellation by ABC after six seasons. Fox brass tried to fit Last Man Standing into the schedule but couldn’t find a way to do it. Fox had been out of the multi-camera business for a while and didn’t have a multi-camera comedy to pair the now-canceled Last Man with. This development season, Fox put an emphasis on multi-camera comedies with several pilots, Rel, The Cool Kids, both of which were ordered to series, and the recently ordered untitled Rob McElhenney & Rob Rosell project, which also is set in middle America.  Last summer, there was one more attempt to find a home for Last Man Standing at CMT, which had had success with the sitcom’s reruns, though talks did not result in a deal.  Related2018 Fox Pilots  Efforts to resurrect Last Man Standing were reignited by the success of ABC’s Roseanne revival this spring. Besides a star of a popular 1990s ABC sitcom (Roseanne‘s Roseanne Barr and Home Improvement‘s Allen), the two shows also share leads who both are supporters of President Donald Trump and reflect views rarely seen in scripted TV series.  The cancellation of Last Man Standing was met with very strong reaction from fans last May. It became a rallying cry for conservatives, with a petition launched that called for ABC to bring back “a show that appeals to a broad swath of Americans who find very few shows that extol the virtues with which they can identify; namely conservative values.” A year later, the petition has amassed 438,000 signatures and there is still enthusiasm among LMS fans about the show coming back, especially following Roseanne‘s return."
"Jennifer Lawrence was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on August 15, 1990. She got her big break at 14, when she was discovered while vacationing in New York City with her family. She quickly landed a part in the TV series The Bill Engvall Show, followed by roles in films that included The Burning Plain, Winter’s Bone, X-Men: First Class and The Hunger Games. She later reprised her role playing Katniss Everdeen in Catching Fire and the two-part Mockingjay. Lawrence won an Academy Award for her work in David O. Russell 's Silver Linings Playbook (2012) and continued to work with the director on American Hustle and Joy, winning Golden Globes for all three projects as well.  Lawrence was an athletic child, involved in cheerleading, field hockey and softball, and thought she might be a doctor when she grew up. She did some modeling and community theater, but never dreamed that she’d become an actress.  Jennifer Shrader Lawrence was born on August 15, 1990, in a suburb of Louisville, Kentucky. She has two older brothers, Blaine and Ben, and her parents, Karen and Gary, owned a farm just outside the city.  Start of Acting Career  Lawrence’s big break came when she was discovered at 14 while on spring break in New York with her family. A stranger asked to take her picture and took her mother’s phone number, then called the next day to ask her to do a screen test. Things happened quickly after that: Lawrence stayed in New York City for the summer, acting in commercials for MTV and filming the 2007 thriller Devil You Know with Lena Olin. (The film was shelved due to lack of distribution and was eventually released in 2013.) Soon after, Lawrence and her family moved to Los Angeles, where she had small roles on the series Medium, Monk and Cold Case, before landing a part on the TBS series The Bill Engvall Show. While working on the series, she also appeared in feature films including The Poker House and The Burning Plain alongside Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger.  After The Bill Engvall Show was canceled, Lawrence went on to appear in the critically acclaimed Winter’s Bone in 2010, which earned her nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Opportunities continued to pour in, and in 2011 Lawrence appeared in The Beaver with Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and Anton Yelchin. She also took on the role of Mystique in X-Men: First Class.  In 2012, Lawrence became a box-office sensation as Katniss Everdeen, the lead in The Hunger Games, the film adaptation of the bestselling novel by Suzanne Collins. Set in a post-apocalyptic state, Lawrence's character must participate in an event in which 24 teens fight to the death as televised entertainment. The film broke box-office records on opening weekend, and Lawrence reprised her role in 2013's The Hunger Games: Catching Fire as well as the two-part Mockingjay (2014 and 2015). As of late 2015, the franchise has earned more than $2.8 billion dollars at the global box office.  'Silver Linings' Oscar  Other 2012 releases for Lawrence included the thriller House at the End of the Street, co-starring Elisabeth Shue, and two dramas with Bradley Cooper: The Falling and Silver Linings Playbook, which earned an array of award nominations and a Golden Globe win (best actress in a comedy or musical) for Lawrence. She took home the Oscar for best actress at the Academy Awards in February 2013. Lawrence seemed overcome with emotion as she accepted the honor.  Lawrence continued to work with Silver Linings Playbook director David O. Russell on 2013's American Hustle, playing the emotionally complex wife of a con artist (Christian Bale). The film co-starred Amy Adams and Cooper. Lawrence received her third Oscar nod for the part, and won her second Globe. In 2014 she co-starred again with Cooper in the little seen drama Serena before once again captivating moviegoers as the mutant Mystique in X-Men: Days of Future Past.  'Joy' and 'Mother'  Lawrence, Cooper and Russell later signed on to bring the story of Miracle Mop inventor Joy Mangano to the big screen, with Lawrence taking on the title role. Joy had a Christmas Day 2015 U.S. release, and Lawrence soon won her third Golden Globe for her performance. Days later she received another Oscar nod. At 25, she became the youngest performer in history to have earned four Academy Award nominations.  Continuing with her high-profile work, in 2016 Lawrence co-starred in X-Men: Apocalypse and the science-fiction film Passengers. The following year she made an impressive leap into the horror genre with the critically acclaimed Mother.  Jennifer Lawrence attends the 'Passengers' Paris Photocall at Hotel George V on November 29, 2016 in Paris, France. (Photo: Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images)  The Wage Gap Essay  In October 2015 Lawrence wrote an essay, which was featured in Lena Dunham's feminist newsletter Lenny, entitled ""Why Do I Make Less Than My Male Co‑Stars?""  Discovering she was paid less than her American Hustle male co-stars via the Sony hacking scandal, Lawrence ultimately blamed herself for not negotiating for more pay.  ""When the Sony hack happened and I found out how much less I was being paid than the lucky people with d*cks, I didn’t get mad at Sony. I got mad at myself. I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. I didn’t want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two franchises, I don’t need,"" she explains.  However, Lawrence admitted she didn't fight for a better salary because she was afraid of how she'd be perceived. ""I would be lying if I didn’t say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight. I didn’t want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled,' "" she confessed. ""This is an element of my personality that I’ve been working against for years, and based on the statistics, I don’t think I’m the only woman with this issue. Are we socially conditioned to behave this way? ... Could there still be a lingering habit of trying to express our opinions in a certain way that doesn’t 'offend' or 'scare' men?""  In her own fiery way, Lawrence concluded she would no longer tolerate inequitable pay for fear of being less liked. Her essay caused a great deal of buzz in the media about ongoing gender wage gap issues."

"It was a perfect summer date night for Ben Affleck.  At Malibu’s upscale Nobu restaurant August 16, the Justice League actor was rapt in conversation with his table mate: a bombshell blonde clad in a nude bodycon dress. Three days later, the lovebirds emerged once again at Santa Monica’s decidedly more-low key Jack in the Box drive-thru. With fries and a cheeseburger in hand, the all-smiles duo sped off in his Range Rover. According to a witness, “They looked so happy together.”  Something was off, however. The passenger was not his love of more than a year, Lindsay Shookus — but 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton. Not only had Affleck, 46, and the Saturday Night Live producer, 38, quietly split — “it’s amicable,” says a source — in just two weeks, the actor had also reverted back to his womanizing ways. It’s a behavior his estranged wife, Jennifer Garner, knows all too well. While still with Garner, Affleck began secretly dating Shookus. And just weeks after the parents of Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, announced the end of their decade-long marriage, Affleck moved on with their then 28-year-old nanny, Christine Ouzounian.  “Jen realized a long time ago that she cannot fix Ben and that his problems are not hers to solve,” a Garner confidant reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly. “She’s not his babysitter. She just wants to protect the kids. But she does wish Ben would keep his life more private.”  Rarely one to be alone, Affleck was quick to find comfort in the arms of Sexton post split. (After photos of them hit the internet, Shookus deleted her Instagram account.) Evenings out aside, Affleck and Playboy’s Miss May 2018 have clocked plenty of hours holed up in his $20 million, seven-bedroom Pacific Palisades bachelor pad, says an insider — much to the dismay of Garner.  “Of course she’s not pleased he’s dating a 22-year-old Playboy model,” says the Garner confidant. “But she’s also not surprised. Jen has come to expect this from Ben. She’s not going to get involved. She can’t make decisions for him.”  For more on Garner and Affleck, pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now!

"Drake Gets Former Porn Star Pregnant She Claims, But He Calls BS  Drake Gets Former Porn Star Pregnant and She Has Text Messages ... She Claims, But He Calls BS  EXCLUSIVE  A woman who was hanging out with Drake after his split with Jennifer Lopez claims she's pregnant with his baby and she says she has text messages to prove it. Drake however, is calling BS.  Sophie Brussaux has already hired a big NYC lawyer, Raoul Felder, to get the paternity/child support ball rolling. She claims she's 3 1/2 months pregnant and pins down conception to either January 20 or 21. The pic was taken January 24 at a Japanese restaurant in Amsterdam.  The woman, a retired porn star, has what she says are text messages between her and Drake, which purport to say the following:  Drake: I want you to have an abortion.  Brussaux: I can't kill my baby simply to indulge you sorry.  Drake: Indulge me? F*** you.  Brussaux: What?  Drake: You do know what you're doing you think you're going to get money.  She says she's having a girl.  We reached out to Drake's people, who say, ""This woman has a very questionable background. She has admitted to having multiple relationships. We understand she may have problems getting into the United States. She's one of many women claiming he got them pregnant.""  The rep goes on, ""If it is in fact Drake's child, which he does not believe, he would do the right thing by the child.""  The rep says he has no idea whether the purported text message is even real or out of context because they haven't seen the actual text.  The rep says Brussaux had sex with another big rapper at the same time as Drake, adding the other rapper has all but acknowledged it's his kid.  Sophie Brussaux’s attorney Raoul Felder, of Felder and Nottes, declined to comment."

"As rumored, Elton John performed during the lunchtime reception that followed the Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The singer also attended the wedding earlier in Saturday in Windsor.

"Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey (Photos: Getty Images)  Rumors of a feud between Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey have existed in Internet lore for years. And, like most pop star-on-pop star feuds which appear to exist solely in the minds of fans, it’s the type of thing that the two are constantly having to deny. Twice this week Jennifer Lopez has had to address it and, twice this week, Lopez has denied it.  So here’s how the whole thing went down.  The Beginnings  In the early ‘00s, Mariah Carey was doing an interview with a foreign TV station in which she was asked her opinion about several pop stars. She called Beyoncé “nice” and “a good writer” and then she was asked about Jennifer Lopez. “I don’t know her,” Mariah Carey said. And, immediately, a meme was born.  If you’ve not seen the GIF, you’ve probably not spent a lot of time on the web.  The Aftermath  It is years later; “I don’t know her” has become perhaps the most iconic words to come out of Mariah Carey’s mouth since “all I want for Christmas is you.” It was Andy Cohen, in 2014, who was the first to ask J.Lo directly about the shade of it all.    “I know from back in the day, I’ve read things that she’s said about me that were not the greatest, but we have never met,” Lopez, who is no amateur at delivering a verbal knockout, said. “Like, we don’t know each other. I think it’s kind of from word of mouth of things that have happened in the past that I’m not really aware of.”    Then, last year, Carey was doing an interview with The Cut in which she was asked about gifts she receives from her army of fans, the “Lambs.”  Recently? I don’t know. [yawns] I’m sorry, I’m having a “sleep” moment…    Well, there was a very interesting shirt that a fan made with a quote that I said years ago that, when I said it, I really wasn’t trying to be funny. I was just being honest and everybody’s kind of blowing it out of proportion but this guy had a shirt on and it was a picture of me that he made and the quote was underneath it — and I’m going to leave you hanging as to what it was.  To recap: Carey yawns before she explains she was “just being honest.” The word shade is thrown around hyperbolically these days, but true shade doesn’t really sound like an insult. However, the recipient knows. Mariah Carey is one of the masters of the art.  Round Two  Talk of the feud picked up after last year’s Billboard Music Awards, at which Lopez was caught checking Instagram during Carey’s performance. Video of Lopez idly scrolling through her feed immediately became Lopez’s visual response to Carey’s “I don’t know her” GIF.  Which Brings Us to This Week…  Jennifer Lopez is currently on a media blitz promoting the staggering number of projects — Shades of Blue, American Idol, The Fosters, etc. — she’s currently working on. Her first stop was Watch What Happens Live where, again, Andy Cohen asked about Mariah Carey.  “First of all, that was not fair with the texting thing because I watched a lot of it — it was a long performance,“ Lopez said, in what is not not shade. “I watched most of it, I may have looked down for one second and people were like, ‘Look at her! Look at her!’”  Lopez then booked it over to The Wendy Williams Show where she was talking about her Vegas residency, saying she saw all the shows currently on before she signed her deal, except for Mariah Carey because Carey’s show didn’t start until Lopez was already back in New York to film Shades of Blue. Williams saw her chance and took it with the gusto of a bird of prey.  “Who?” the talk show host joked of Carey. “No, I’m playing because that’s what Mariah said about Jennifer one time.”    “She does say that,” Lopez responded, before delivering her magnum opus. “She’s forgetful I guess.”"

"CLOSE Emma Stone stars as Billie Jean King and Steve Carell is Bobby Riggs in the 1970s-set sports film 'Battle of the Sexes.' Fox Searchlight  It took more than Hollywood magic to turn Emma Stone, the svelte actress from La La Land, into Billie Jean King in her new movie Battle of the Sexes.  For starters, the physical transformation required three months, 15 pounds and a meal and fitness plan.  Trainer Jason Walsh, founder of climbing gym Rise Nation, who got Stone in shape for La La Land, knew the actress would need to up her calorie intake and strength training regimen to embody the powerful tennis legend.  Here's what Stone went through to reshape her body.  For her role in 'Battle of the Sexes,' Emma Stone gained 15 pounds. (Photo: Melinda Sue Gordon, 20th Century Fox Film)  She wasn’t afraid of packing on pounds.  Stone is “very petite and has a dancer's body,” but she was willing to bulk up to look more like King. “She took it seriously,"" Walsh says. ""She wanted to do the story justice.”  Gaining a dozen-plus pounds of muscle made Stone look more like a tennis pro, and also feel more like her character. “We wanted to give Emma the psychological backing” to be able to compete in professional tennis matches, Walsh says. “She needed to be resilient and to have the psyche of being really strong.”  Emma Stone, here with co-star Ryan Gosling, had a lithe look for 'La La Land.' (Photo: Dale Robinette)  She drank two high-cal protein shakes a day.  “It wasn’t like we were taking someone off the Taco Bell diet,” Walsh says of his clean-eating client, “but we added shakes into her diet."" The shakes had “hundreds of calories” each, he says, and usually contained a handful of spinach, a supplement known as ashwagandha and a “good tasting"" protein powder. Fortunately, since Stone was working out so much (twice a day), she was hungry enough to down the filling beverages.  Emma Stone getting her deadlift on. Ladies, DEADLIFT!!!! This lift will change your life. #Strongisthenewsexy #strong #motivated A post shared by JASON WALSH (@risemovement) on Sep 21, 2015 at 7:54am PDT  She lifted an impressive amount of weight.  Some of Walsh’s daily go-to strength training exercises for Stone? Pushing and pulling sleds twice her size, heavy farmer’s walks (aka walking while holding dumbbells) and up to 300-pound hip thrusts. At one point, Stone was deadlifting 185 pounds and doing push-ups with 50 pounds of chains on her back.  “I was pretty proud,” Walsh says.  The ""Battle of the Sexes"" Working with Emma is pure hell...we loathe each other #battleofthesexes #emmastone A post shared by JASON WALSH (@risemovement) on Sep 22, 2017 at 6:34pm PDT  Then she backed off.  While Stone was gaining weight, she stayed away from fat-burning cardio. But once she achieved the right look for the film, “we started adding conditioning aspects,” Walsh says. That meant Stone was lifting fewer weights and doing cardio at Rise Nation once or twice a week.  She's two years beyond her most intensive Battle of the Sexes training, but Walsh encourages the actress, and anyone else trying to stay in shape, to mix activities like yoga and hiking with strength training.  Yes, for women. And, yes, that means lifting weights.  “I train (GLOW star) Alison Brie and (future Captain Marvel) Brie Larson, and all of these girls are strong as hell and not big,” he says. In fact, after incorporating weight-lifting into their workout routine, “They fit into their clothes better (and) are three, four, five times stronger than before.”  Want to see the results of Stone's hard work? Battle of the Sexes is in theaters now in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, San Francisco and Washington. It expands nationwide Friday.

"The reality of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's break becoming a permanent breakup may be sinking in for the Biebs, or so People's new report suggests. A source close to Bieber told the outlet that despite all the Baskin Champion romance talk, Justin Bieber just wants to have Gomez back with him—at church, the ice rink, and beyond. “He loves her. He wants her back,” the source said, adding that Bieber “misses” Gomez.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Bieber and Gomez's last big public date was his father's wedding in Jamaica, where they recreated their 2011 wedding kiss. They spent 6 out of 7 consecutive days together that week, indicating they were stronger than ever and might make their on-off relationship permanently on this time, according to the tabloids.  But Gomez's family never approved of the Biebs, a major factor that led to their break, some outlets reported. And Bieber, according to Us Weekly's source, started acting selfish again, annoying Gomez. “[He] doesn’t care about anyone but himself,"" the source told Us on March 12. ""The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn’t need him.”  The break seemed to be instigated by Gomez right around Bieber's March 1 birthday. Bieber never wanted this: ""Justin has been upset about the recent break from Selena and is trying to keep busy until they work things out,"" a source told E! on March 21. ""It wasn't his choice for them to split, and he is really taking time to focus on himself right now.""  Meanwhile, Gomez had a realization, E! reported on March 26: that he may be better, but they may still not be right... at least right now. ""Selena realized even though he's made some positive improvements, they just aren't a perfect match right now,"" a source told the outlet.  But Gomez's birthday post to Bieber remains on her Instagram, a sign that hope may not be lost yet.  Gomez was most recently photographed with her friends yesterday, posing in pink pajamas and Puma merch. She was also filmed lipsyncing in the car by her assistant Theresa Mingus:  Instagram  Bieber attended Holy Wednesday church service with Baskin Champion but has not been photographed with her since. His last appearance was on his social media on Easter, when he posted four bunny selfies."

"The guest list hasn’t been set for the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but a number of things could stand in the way of President Donald Trump getting an invite.But a former U.S. president might make the list, due to his friendship with the young British royal: Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle, who appear to have amiable relations with Harry and his elder brother and future king, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge.Asked about the potential guest list, Kensington Palace spokeswoman Julie Barley told Newsweek, “We’re focusing on the happy announcement of their engagement,” adding that invitations “will be announced in due course.”Mark Blinch/ReutersWhen the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were married, in 2011, the Obamas were left off the guest list because of the added security costs of protecting the president. The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn’t require as extensive a security detail as he once did.If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry’s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.Instead of a state visit, Trump’s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a “working trip” where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go “one better” than Obama’s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowRead more: Melania Trump “went bananas” when Ivana Trump called herself 'first lady'The Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry.

Prince Harry also hosted Obama at Kensington Palace in May.As for President Trump, Harry's wife-to-be revealed that she was not a fan. In an interview on The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore during the 2016 election, Markle said she might decide to stay in Toronto—where her show, Suits, is filmed—if Trump were to win.“We film Suits in Toronto, and I might just stay in Canada. I mean, come on, if that's reality we are talking about, come on, that is a game changer in terms of how we move in the world here,” she said.Markle supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the election, calling Trump “misogynistic.”Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Commonwealth leaders are expected to receive invitations to the wedding because of their nations' ties to the British Empire."

"She had been running as a Republican in California's 44th District.  Actress and former Fox News commentator Stacey Dash will withdraw from her congressional race just one month after filing the necessary paperwork to run as a Republican in California's 44th District.  Insiders told The Hollywood Reporter on Friday that her decision was partially based on fear she had for the safety of her family.  ""There were too many threats against her and her family. It was overwhelming,"" said one person close to her campaign.  Dash, perhaps best known for her role as Dionne in the 1995 comedy Clueless, was a Democrat who voted for President Barack Obama in 2008, though by 2012 she had switched parties and she has been controversial (at least among liberals) practically ever since.  In 2016, for example, she criticized feminists for not allowing men to ""be masculine"" and she criticized the notion of transgender people choosing which public restroom to use, calling it a ""tyranny by the minority.""  Dash, a black and Hispanic woman, also criticized the BET Awards and Black History Month, opinions that led to an appearance at the 2016 Oscars where Chris Rock jokingly introduced her to a baffled audience as the ""new director"" of the Academy's ""minority outreach program.""  In a lengthy statement emailed to THR, Dash acknowledged she intends to quit the race, saying her ""goal was, and remains, to improve the lives of people who have been forgotten for decades by the Democratic Party.""  Dash had been one of three conservatives in Hollywood who had decided to run for office as Republicans in California; former soap star Antonio Sabato Jr. is running for Congress in the state's 26th District and film producer Frank DeMartini is running for the seat occupied by Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California's 43rd District.  ""After much prayer, introspection and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" Dash said in her statement. ""I believe that the overall bitterness surrounding our political process, participating in the rigors of campaigning, and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of my family. I would never want to betray the personal and spiritual principles I believe in most: that my God and my family come first.""  She added that she knows her ""political positions have often been labeled as controversial, but the real controversy is how decades of government corruption and political disempowerment have created a system where skyrocketing home prices, dirty needles in the streets, and long bus trips to other districts for jobs are somehow considered acceptable."""
"  Actor Terry Crews, right, with co-host Michael Strahan on “Good Morning America,” on Wednesday, Nov. 15, 2017. Crews told Strahan that he never felt “more objectified” than when a powerful Hollywood agent, Adam Venit, groped him at a party last year. (Paula Lobo/ABC via AP)  Actor Terry Crews has identified the Hollywood executive who allegedly groped him at an industry party in February 2016 as Adam Venit, the head of the motion picture department at a major talent agency in Beverly Hills.  “He’s connected to probably everyone I know in the business,” Crews, 49, told “Good Morning America” on Wednesday. “I did not know this man. I never had a conversation with him, ever.”  Crews, a former NFL player who currently stars as a police sergeant on the television show “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” first spoke out about the alleged sexual assault on Twitter in mid-October, shortly after the New York Times published an explosive story about decades of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein.  At least 20 high-profile men in Hollywood, the media and the political sphere have since faced allegations of sexually harassing or assaulting women and men.  On Wednesday, Crews told Good Morning America that the executive was Venit, an executive at William Morris Endeavor, which Crews said is “one of the biggest agencies in the world — period.” Venit has represented actors such as Emma Stone, Eddie Murphy and Adam Sandler. Two of his clients, actors Dustin Hoffman and Brett Ratner, were also accused of sexual misconduct earlier this month.  Venit has been suspended from William Morris Endeavor, according to ABC News. The agency could not be immediately reached for comment.  On Oct. 10, Crews wrote a long thread on Twitter and said that the Weinstein news had given him PTSD, as he was groped by a “high level Hollywood executive” during an event last year he attended with his wife.  This whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD. Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME. (1/Cont.) — terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017  My wife n I were at a Hollywood function last year n a high level Hollywood executive came over 2 me and groped my privates.

(3/cont.) — terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017  I was going to kick his ass right then— but I thought twice about how the whole thing would appear.

(16/end) — terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017  Crews was at the packed party last year with his wife, Rebecca King-Crews, when Venit began staring at him, making “overtly sexual” moves with his tongue, he told “Good Morning America.”  “I’m looking like, ‘Is this a joke?’ I mean I don’t understand, it was actually so bizarre,” Crews said. “He comes over to me. I stick my hand out and he literally takes his hand and puts it and squeezes my genitals. And I jump back like, ‘Hey! Hey!’”  “And he’s still licking his tongue out and all this stuff, and I go, ‘Dude, what are you doing? What are you doing?’ And then he comes back again! And he just won’t stop,” Crews said.  [After Weinstein, Hollywood launches anti-sexual-harassment hotline]  Crews said he then pushed Venit away from him, and Venit bumped into other partygoers. Venit then began laughing and giggling, Crews said.  “I have never felt more emasculated, more objectified,” Crews said. “I wake up every morning wondering, ‘Did this really happen?’ ”  Crews said he was concerned about his wife during the incident, and positioned himself between her and Venit so that Venit wouldn’t approach her. Afterward, Crews said he was filled with rage, and felt like he “could punch a hole in his head.” When he and his wife got in the car to drive home, Crews said he “almost ripped the steering wheel off.”  Crews said his wife calmed him down, and was proud of him for not resorting to violence. As an African American man, Crews said, he is aware that, had he physically confronted Venit, he would “immediately be seen as a thug.”  Crews said he understands why many victims don’t come forward. They’re up against powerful people in Hollywood and fear people won’t believe their stories, and that their careers will suffer as a result, he said.  In the fallout of claims, which range from sexual misconduct to rape, some have resigned and others have been fired. Kevin Spacey in late October was accused of making sexual advances on a minor, and he has since been banished from the last season of the Netflix original series “House of Cards.” He has also been cut from the finished production of director Ridley Scott’s “All the Money in the World,” replaced by actor Christopher Plummer. Such a last-minute recasting in a finished movie is unprecedented.  Earlier this month, the New York Times published five women’s allegations of sexual misconduct against comedian Louis C.K. Less than 24 hours later, the release of his new movie, “I Love You, Daddy,” was canceled. Netflix announced it would not produce the comedian’s planned comedy special. FX announced it would end its relationship with him, cutting its deal with him and removing him as the executive producer of four shows.  Crews himself said he put the incident in the back of his mind until the Weinstein allegations, which encouraged him to tweet in October about what happened. He filed a police report earlier this month.  “I will not be shamed. I will not be shamed. I did nothing wrong,” he told “Good Morning America.”  Read more:  George Takei, Richard Dreyfuss and Gary Goddard accused of sexual misconduct  ‘All that anger’s unleashed’: How sexual misconduct stories persuade other victims to come forward"

"Luann de Lesseps has been sued by her ex-husband and two children.  The Real Housewives of New York City star’s first husband, Alexandre de Lesseps, her daughter, Victoria de Lesseps, and son, Noel de Lesseps, have filed a lawsuit against Luann, 53, over a judgement in her divorce that they allege she didn’t follow through on.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  According to court documents obtained by The Blast, Luann breached a stipulation of settlement in her divorce by failing to create a trust “for the benefit of her two children.”  “This action arises from Defendant’s breach of a Stipulation of Settlement and related Judgment of Divorce by her failure to create a trust for the benefit of her children, her conversion of the trust’s corpus and her present threat to abscond with money derived from the potential sale of the trust corpus and use it to purchase, for herself alone, a luxury home in upstate New York,” the documents read.  The judgment in her divorce required Alexandre to give the deed of the former couple’s marital residence in Bridgehampton, New York, to Luann, who agreed to create a trust for her two children. Luann was also required to “fund the trust with an undivided one-half interest in and to the Marital Residence,” according to the documents.  Now, Alexandre, Victoria and Noel are claiming Luann “never created” the trust and instead sold the residence in November 2014 for $8 million and used the earnings to purchase a home in Southampton, New York for $3.1 million.  According to the settlement, if the marital home was sold, “the entire net proceeds of the sale may at any time prior to the termination of the Trust, be reinvested by [Luann] to purchase another residence, provided that the children shall continue to be the owners, in Trust, of an undivided one-half interest in said property.”  But the documents allege that Luann “has never, since her purchase of the Premises, created the Trust or conveyed to her children, in Trust, an undivided one-half interest in the Premises.”  According to the documents, Luann has threatened to sell her home “for more than fifty percent its present value and leave Suffolk County with the proceeds … so that she may purchase, for herself alone, a luxury home in upstate New York.”  Alexandre, Victoria and Noel are seeking for Luann to abide by the judgment and to prevent her from listing or selling the home.  A rep for de Lesseps did not respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment."

"Updated | A new book by Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has been making headlines for its controversial claims about the 2016 presidential election and the Hillary Clinton campaign. But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory.Axios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, “In loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazile; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem’s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y’all.”Related: TV Ad With Russian Subtitles Questions Seth Rich’s MurderRich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.Media reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, “Those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.”SAUL LOEB/AFP/GettyRich appears elsewhere in Brazile’s book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Rich’s murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowBrazile talked about Rich on ABC News’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: “They don’t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don’t know what it’s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.”Brazile had spoken publicly about Rich’s death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, “Seth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth’s legacy to his country and party is shameful.” About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, “Seth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.”Through spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, “Since Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family’s efforts to find Seth’s killers.”In the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton’s campaign headquarters seemed “antiseptic, like a hospital,” and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a “slave.” In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.Former aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile’s claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”Brazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member. The publisher was unavailable to verify the reported wording of the book dedication.This article has been updated to alter the spelling of the last name of Sheila Brazile, which was misspelled as Brazioutlanle by another media outlet."
"Worse for wear. Brad Pitt is reeling over the end of his two-year marriage (and 14-year relationship) with Angelina Jolie, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly. According to the insider, the Fight Club hunk’s impending divorce from the Oscar-winning actress, 41, has been a tough pill to swallow.  “He is beside himself and has been crying. He was completely caught off guard and blindsided and had no idea she would do this,” the source tells Us of Pitt’s fragile emotional state after Jolie filed divorce documents on Monday, September 19.  “Angelina filed the court papers a minute before the courts closed on Monday night,” the insider explains of the Maleficent star’s tactful filing. “He didn’t have a lawyer or anything. She had threatened divorce in the past but he did not think she would file this time.”  The source adds: “He is completely devastated and beside himself. He is a shattered man.""  ""He’s extremely upset,"" another source tells Us. ""But he is totally focused on just being helpful and making sure his kids are doing as well as possible.""  As previously reported, Jolie cited irreconcilable differences in her divorce docs. The humanitarian and actress is requesting sole physical custody of their six kids, Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8. The divorce filings indicate that she requested Pitt receive joint legal custody. She is not asking for spousal support.  A third insider previously told Us that Jolie’s decision to part ways with the World War Z actor “was only made one week ago.”  Days after the shocking news of Brangelina’s demise broke, it was reported that Pitt, 52, was being investigated for child abuse by the FBI following an incident (caught on tape, an insider told Us) that occurred on the former couple’s private plane.  According to multiple insiders, the dad of six can be seen on video “looking drunk” and “yelling.” The footage is reportedly from Wednesday, September 14, after the family’s jet stopped for fuel at Minnesota’s International Falls Airport during their flight from Nice, France, to Burbank, California.  “In response to your inquiry regarding allegations within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States; specifically, an aircraft carrying Mr. Brad Pitt and his children, the FBI is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued,"" the FBI told Us in a statement on Thursday. (The FBI has jurisdiction over the situation because the alleged incident happened in the air.)  Earlier this week, a source told Us that some of Jolie and Pitt’s most contentious fights leading up to their breakup stemmed from their disagreement over opposing parenting styles, among other factors. “[Jolie] did try to make it work, but her kids come first, and she couldn't let them see Mommy and Daddy like this,” the source explained. ""The fighting got worse, and they disagreed a lot about parenting and a lot of things.""

"Christmas is a time for goodwill, seasonal cheer, and forgiveness, so it seems fitting that the royal family is set to move past some recent rumors to once again celebrate Christmas en masse at the royal estate of Sandringham.  Despite talk of sibling rivalry, tearful duchesses, and diva-like behavior in the court of Kensington Palace, William and Kate Middleton and Harry and Meghan Markle will be together on Christmas Day, the Palace has confirmed. The news comes just after Kensington Palace attempted to snuff out reports of difficulty between the duchesses with a terse comment to The Sun over the weekend.  Although it is William and Kate’s turn to visit the Middletons this year (they usually alternate Christmas between their two families and spent Christmas with the Queen last year), royal sources say that they have decided to join the royal family for Christmas Day.  It is believed they will then head to Bucklebury, Kate’s parents’ hometown, to enjoy a second Christmas with her family.  Kate’s mother, Carole Middleton, revealed in her first-ever interview, published in The Daily Telegraph over the weekend, that she has prepared an extra-special Christmas this year to welcome the two newest family members, her grandsons Prince Louis and Arthur, son of Pippa Middleton.  There will be no fewer than 12 Christmas trees at Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family’s home, with one just for Prince George to decorate, but the Cambridges will have to skip the Middletons’ traditional smoked salmon and Champagne brunch on Christmas morning because they will be with the Queen and the rest of the royal family at church in Norfolk. It will be the first time the Cambridges and the Sussexes, a.k.a the “Fab Four,” will have been pictured together since reports of a simmering feud rocked the Palace.  It was reported this weekend that courtiers have launched a “mole hunt” to try to uncover who has been leaking stories of tensions between Harry and William and Kate and Meghan. Reports of discord between the couples emerged after Kensington Palace announced last weekend that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be moving out of Kensington Palace in the new year and into Frogmore House in Windsor.  Since then it has been claimed that Kate and Meghan don’t get along and that the brothers have fallen out because William voiced concerns about how quickly Harry’s relationship with Meghan was moving.  The Queen, who dislikes any rumors of discord regarding her family, will no doubt be relieved that the family will be coming together on Christmas Day. After the family celebrates with a turkey dinner on Christmas Eve, the sight of the foursome at church on Christmas morning will, courtiers hope, put an end to the unhappy narrative that the couples have fallen out.

"Baby on the way! Stacy Keibler is pregnant and expecting her second child with her husband, Jared Pobre, Us Weekly can confirm.  The former WWE wrester, 38, and the businessman, 43, secretly tied the knot in March 2014. They welcomed their first child, daughter Ava Grace, now 3, that August.  Three months after giving birth to their daughter, Keibler, who dated actor George Clooney from 2011 to 2013, revealed she never thought about marriage or parenthood until she started a relationship with her now-husband.  “Life can be unpredictable. You feel one way, and then … boom!” Keibler wrote on her lifestyle blog in December 2014. “You need to entirely change your perspective. That is certainly what happened to me this past year. Until I started dating Jared, the idea of being married and having a family was never on my radar. I was just hoping that the right love would find me.”  “But after a serendipitous reconnection with Jared, a friend who turned out to be my soulmate, we created a family together almost instantly,” she continued. “Talk about a serious change in my reality! This year and the holiday season especially has me feeling so nostalgic about family — my family, my new family, and of course, the newest addition to our family. Ava has graced us with such joy, such light and such love–we never saw it coming. She is our special little lady, and I couldn’t be more thankful for how she has opened my heart.”  The Dancing With the Stars season 2 alum has maintained a low profile since becoming a mother. In addition to shutting down her blog, Keibler has not updated her Instagram account since September 2015. The last post she shared on the social media platform was of herself reading a book titled “What Does It Mean to Be Kind?” to Ava.  Clooney, for his part, also started a family after his split from Keibler. The Oscar winner, 57, welcomed twins Alexander and Ella in June 2017 with his wife, Amal Clooney, whom he wed in September 2014.

"CLOSE Janet Jackson is being honored with the Icon Award at the Billboard Music Awards on Sunday. Time  Janet Jackson, in New York in 2017, says she struggled with depression. (Photo: Andy Kropa/Invision/AP)  Janet Jackson is opening up about life behind ""The Velvet Rope"" in a revelatory letter for Essence magazine previewed on the publication's website as well as ""Good Morning America"" Wednesday.  The 52-year-old singer/actress graces the cover of the magazine's July/August issue which is devoted to happiness. In addition to talking about the joy that her 1-year-old son Eissa Al Mana brings, Jackson writes of the darker times as well.  “When it comes to happiness, I’m no expert,” she writes in the letter. “I have only my life experience as a guide. I’ve known great happiness and great sadness.""  Jackson's 30s were far from perfect, plagued with mental health issues.  “I struggled with depression. The struggle was intense,"" she writes. ""Low self-esteem might be rooted in childhood feelings of inferiority. It could relate to failing to meet impossibly high standards.  ""And of course there are always the societal issues of racism and sexism,"" she continues. ""Put it all together and depression is a tenacious and scary condition. Thankfully, I found my way through it.”  More: Janet Jackson surprises Missy Elliott with Essence honor  Janet Jackson gets personal, opening up about overcoming depression. @dianermacedo has the story about the reigning queen of Rhythm Nation: pic.twitter.com/qHqM42suU9 — Good Morning America (@GMA) June 20, 2018  The following decade was also challenging for her.  “In my forties: Like millions of women in the world, I still heard voices inside my head berating me, voices questioning my value,” she writes.  “Happiness was elusive,"" she adds. ""A reunion with old friends might make me happy. A call from a colleague might make me happy. But because sometimes I saw my failed relationships as my fault, I easily fell into despair.”  In her fifties, however, Jackson has found a source of joy, her baby boy. Even amid a contentious split from Eissa's father, Wissam Al Mana. Early this month, law enforcement performed a welfare check on the child in Al Mana's custody, at Jackson's request. Public Information Officer Deputy Tracy Koerner told USA TODAY no arrests were made.  Jackson's brother Randy previously alleged his sister was verbally abused by Al Mana, a charge lawyers for Al Mana called ""deeply hurtful"" in a statement to People magazine.  But on balance, it seems Jackson has found contentment.  ""The height of happiness is holding my baby son in my arms and hearing him coo, or when I look into his smiling eyes and watch him respond to my tenderness,"" she says in her letter. ""When I kiss him. When I sing him softly to sleep. During those sacred times, happiness is everywhere.”  The new issue of Essence arrives on newsstands Friday.

"Luann de Lesseps is the latest woman to come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Russell Simmons, reportedly accusing the music mogul of groping her in an elevator — an accusation which Simmons has denied.  “He grabbed my ass in an elevator, he was just a pig. I haven’t told anybody about that before. I was grossed out. I was like, ‘How dare you,’ ” the Real Housewives of New York City star, 52, told The Daily Beast, according to an interview published on Friday.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “He invaded me, he took advantage of me, being who he is, thinking he is all ‘it,’ all everything. He thought he could just do that. I looked at him and said, ‘Don’t ever do that again,’ ” she added of the alleged encounter, which she told the outlet occurred “around three summers ago, at Soho Beach House, Miami.”  When asked if he apologized, de Lesseps reportedly told The Daily Beast, “No. Of course he didn’t apologize.”  The reality star added that she chose not to report the alleged misconduct at the time.  Simmons, 60, has been accused of sexual misconduct by several women, with allegations ranging from inappropriate behavior in business meetings to rape at his apartment — all of which he has denied. The accusations span more than three decades, according to various reports by The Hollywood Reporter, The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times.

Simmons said his “relations have been consensual” and the “horrific accusations have shocked me to my core.”  Ben Gabbe/Getty Images  RELATED: 16 Women Accuse Music Producer Russell Simmons of Sexual Misconduct — Everything They’ve Said  When reached by PEOPLE for a response to de Lesseps’ allegation in The Daily Beast piece, Simmons’ rep shared a variation of statements previously given to media outlets in response to previous allegations: “I am blessed to have shared extraordinary relationships, whether through work or love, with many great women and I have enormous respect for the women’s movement worldwide and their struggle for respect, dignity, equality and power,” said Simmons. “I am devastated by any reason I may have given to anyone to say or think of me in the ways that are currently being described.”  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

I have re-dedicated myself to spiritual learning, healing and working on behalf of the communities to which I have devoted my life. I have accepted that I can and should get dirt on my sleeves if it means witnessing the birth of a new consciousness about women. What I cannot accept is responsibility for what I have not done. The current allegations range from the patently untrue to the frivolous and hurtful.”"

Aaron Carter; Melissa Schuman Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty; Matthew Simmons/Getty  Carter, now 38, responded to the allegations in November with an exclusive statement to PEOPLE.  “I am shocked and saddened by Ms. Schuman’s accusations. Melissa never expressed to me while we were together or at any time since that anything we did was not consensual. We went on to record a song and perform together, and I was always respectful and supportive of Melissa both personally and professionally,” the Backstreet Boys band member said.  “This is the first that I am hearing about these accusations, nearly two decades later.

It was then, she wrote, that Carter allegedly began to unbutton her pants and ignored her objections before allegedly performing oral sex on her. Schuman claimed he then demanded she perform oral sex on him.  Despite allegedly telling Carter that she was a virgin and waiting until marriage to have sex, Carter allegedly led her to his bedroom where she claims that he raped her.  RELATED: Carter Family Woes: The Music Clan’s Troubled History  During an appearance on Dr. Oz, that aired Dec. 1, Schuman revealed why she didn’t move forward with pressing charges 15 years ago after the alleged incident first occurred.  “I’d actually confided in my manager at that time about pressing charges. And I was told that [Carter] had the most powerful litigator in the country and that I didn’t have the money to pay for an attorney to essentially defend me, if he were to come after me,” she said.  “My manager told me, ‘You know you’re trying to build a name for yourself right now, everyone’s going to call you fame hungry, that you’re trying to use this to better yourself or get your name out there and at this point there’s nothing we can do,’” she continued. “I remember telling him, ‘Oh, so that’s it… he just gets away with it?!’”"
"Khloé Kardashian didn’t get what she wanted, and she’s glad about it. The new mom opened up to her Twitter followers about why she longed for her first child to be a boy.  I wanted a boy so badly Because Mason and I are so close. I love our bond. I felt confident in having a boy but God blessed me with my precious True and now I wouldn’t know what to do with a boy.

True has made me sweeter and more gentle. God gives you what you need. My BFF 4Life.”  Kardashian, 34, noted that True fits in well with the two cousins closest to her in age: Kim Kardashian’s 6-month-old daughter, Chicago, and Kylie Jenner’s 5-month-old little girl, Stormi. “ANDDDD she has her two cousins to be her besties,” she added. “We call them the triplets it’s just the cutest!!

Meanwhile, she was completely honest on Saturday when a fan tweeted her to ask if her body bounced back after giving birth to True. “Hell no!! Lol i’m still working on it. And it will come in time … I hope LOL,” she quipped. “But sitting down I have a completely different stomach then I used to have LOL I really can’t even talk about it.”  When put on the spot about whether she thinks about having more children, the Good American founder — who welcomed her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson in April — was equally as forthcoming: “Not right now lol True is only 3 months old so give me some time lol.”  Over on her Instagram Story, Khloé enjoyed time with True, singing to her: “Good morning to you / Good morning to you / Good morning, sweet True/ Good morning to you,” before adding, “That’s your song.” The baby cooed and smiled as her mom serenaded her.  baby True 💗 A post shared by Kardashian Videos.

"Ever since Donald Trump, a former reality television star, was elected the President of the United States, we’ve regularly wondered if other celebrities are going to run for the same position in the 2020 election. In the last few months, we’ve heard rumors that Oprah Winfrey, Kanye West, Duane “The Rock” Johnson, and Katy Perry are going to run — and that’s just naming a few. There’s also George Clooney, whose recent donation has some people wondering: George Clooney for president?  The topic was first broached back in the beginning of September 2017, when Clooney was doing press for his movie Suburbicon. A reporter asked if he’d like to run for president one day, and Clooney said,  ""Would I like to be the next president? Oh, that sounds like fun. Can I just say that I'd like anybody to be the next president of the United States. Right away, please.""  Nothing but respect for my President and George Clooney. https://t.co/x0aCjAI2RW — J. (@JojoCule) February 20, 2018  Now, Clooney’s latest actions have fans wondering if he might actually run for office. Clooney and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, pledged $500,000 to help fund the U.S. student-run march on Washington. Called the “March for Our Lives,” it’s taking place on March 24th, along with sister rallies across the country. The march is a response to the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that took the lives of 17 people, and it’s a way for the students who survived to take some serious action to demand gun control reform.  George Clooney will March For Our Lives ... pic.twitter.com/HlA8U2K4xW — Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) February 20, 2018  Shortly after the Clooneys made their donation, rumors hit the news circuit.  Fox News host and Donald Trump supporter Sean Hannity expressed his support, saying, “My attitude is, ‘Run, George, run.’ If George Clooney wants to run, I’m all for it. I think Oprah Winfrey would be infinitely better as a candidate than George Clooney.”  Hannity’s comments are sarcastic. What he’s trying to say is that he doesn’t think Clooney has a chance at winning, which is why he would want him to run — so that Trump could win again.  George Clooney for President. I'm not a fan in general, but he does more for this country then all the Trumps and their administration put together. — U.S. Blues 🌊🌊🌊 (@starshine731) February 20, 2018  Is there a chance Clooney might actually make a move?  Most likely not. His original comment about running was a joke, and when fans ran with it, Clooney cleared up any confusion in an interview with Variety, during which he said he doesn’t think celebrities should hold the position. He stated,  "" I think that having a celebrity as president who has a star on Hollywood Boulevard will exorcise our need to have someone famous in office. And maybe we’ll find someone who knows how to make policy.""  So, we probably won’t be calling him President George Clooney any time soon. But hey, one can dream, right?"
"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There’s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that’s served deliciously chilly. It’s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we’ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that’s what Stanley’s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.  Dinner for two, with sherries and wine, came to €84.75."

"Gabrielle Union is the newest victim of being in the wrong place at the wrong time — still, she's not taking any blame for somehow getting sucked into Hollywood's latest scandal.  Earlier this week, Tristan Thompson made headlines for all the wrong reasons when TMZ reported that the NBA star cheated on then-pregnant girlfriend Khloe Kardashian a handful of times ( Kardashian has since given birth ) — first, on April 7 during an outing in New York City, and before then, during an October 2017 encounter.  In one incriminating photo posted to The Shade Room 's Instagram account, Union mysteriously pops up behind one of Thompson's alleged flings. But the actress wasted no time immediately shutting down the idea that she had anything to do with any of it.  ""Don't know her. Didn't see her,"" Union wrote. ""I was enjoying my night with my mama and aunt. We ain't involved in this.""  Though it was reported that Kardashian was devastated upon hearing the news that Thompson may have been unfaithful, she has since been consumed by happiness upon the birth of her daughter , and People reports she is in the process of mending fences with her child's father.  “She’s basically already forgiven him,” a source said. “She is in a bubble of love and peace and happiness right now, and everything that happened with Tristan is less about ‘cheating’ and more like, it was just a random drunken hookup that meant nothing and was kissing at most and didn’t lead to anything else and was the fault of stupid groupies trying to trap him, and everybody just needs to move on.”"

"It was just announced that Ben Stiller has split from his wife of 17 years, Christine Taylor.  And new pictures show the 51-year-old enjoying a pizza in Italy this week.  The actor posed for pictures at Gino Sorbillo's popular pizzeria in Naples.  Split slice: Ben Stiller got to enjoy pizza on a trip to Italy shortly before announcing his split from wife of 17 years Christine Taylor  He also stopped by a local art gallery, buying a terracotta statue of a clown, E! News reported..  Stiller had arrived there from Cannes, France, where he had attended the premiere of his latest movie, The Meyerowitz Stories: New and Selected.  On Friday the couple announced the shock news of their split in a joint statement.  'With tremendous love and respect for each other, and the 18 years we spent together as a couple, we have made the decision to separate,' Stiller and Taylor told ET.  The actor also enjoyed a visit to the Galleria Borbonica in Naples  It's over: On Friday the couple announced the shock news of their split in a joint statement (pictured at the Met Gala in May 2016)  'Our priority will continue to be raising our children as devoted parents and the closest of friends. We kindly ask that the media respect our privacy at this time.'  Ben, 51 and Christine, 45, first met on the set of Fox TV pilot Heat Vision and Jack in 1999.  They married in 2000 at an oceanfront ceremony in Kauai, Hawaii and share two children, daughter Ella Olivia, 15 and son Quinlin Dempsey, 12.  'When I met her, I pretty much thought, ""That's the person,""' Ben told ET in a 2007 interview. 'It was like, ""Wow, this is a great person. I love her.""'  Over the years the couple starred in several comedies together, including Zoolander, Zoolander 2, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, Tropic Thunder and Arrested Development.  On the promo trail: The 51-year-old actor was pictured in Cannes last week with Adam Sandler for the premiere of The Meyerowitz Stories  Family affair: The last time the duo posed on the red carpet together was April 17 with daughter Ella at the Broadway opening night of Groundhog Day  In October last year, Ben revealed he had privately endured a secret health battle after being diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2014.  The Zoolander actor admitted he was taken aback when doctors detected the life-threatening disease because it came 'out of the blue'.  Speaking on SiriusXM's The Howard Stern Show in October, he said: 'It came out of the blue for me. I had no idea.  'At first, I didn't know what was going to happen. I was scared. It just stopped everything in your life because you can't plan for a movie because you don't know what's going to happen.  'As I learned more about my disease (one of the key learnings is not to Google 'people who died of prostate cancer' immediately after being diagnosed with prostate cancer), I was able to wrap my head around the fact that I was incredibly fortunate,' he wrote in a blog post.  They married in 2000 and share two children, daughter Ella Olivia, 15 and son Quinlin Dempsey, 12  Comedy duo: Over the years the couple starred in several comedies together, including 2004's Dodgeball (pictured)  'Fortunate because my cancer was detected early enough to treat. And also because my internist gave me a test he didn't have to.'  In February 2016 the couple opened up about how working together affected their marriage while promoting Zoolander 2, which Christine also stars in.  'It's the best. I mean, I think that, you know, the reality is there's such an unspoken connection,' Christine explained.  'I feel like for us, when we first met, it was on set... He's amazing.'  Working together: The duo are seen on the set of Zoolander in 2000  '[Having a] sense of humor [is the secret to our marriage],' she added, 'I have to say, sense of humor is the greatest thing.'  Ben agreed, adding 'I say that's the secret to a happy marriage anywhere in any city, not just Hollywood,  'I think you got to laugh, because after a while, you know, life is life. We all have to deal with what life throws at us, so you got to have a sense of humor about it. If you can share that, at the end, it makes a huge difference.'"

"Have you been hearing a lot about facial mists, setting sprays, and primer sprays lately and wondering what all the hype is about? Many women swear by spritzing their face with these types of products for a variety of reasons. Depending on which one you use, a facial mist, setting spray, or primer spray can help to perk up tired-looking skin, set your makeup, prep your skin for face makeup, or provide an additional boost of hydration—which can be particularly helpful if you have dry skin. But generally, all skin types can reap the benefits of a facial mist or setting spray. Ready to add one to your beauty routine? Keep reading to find out more about what they can do!  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT FACE SPRAYS AND MISTS?  Wondering what exactly the difference is between all of the types of face sprays we’ve mentioned already? Facial mists are generally designed to help provide skin with a little boost of hydration, giving you an instantly refreshed feeling. Toss one in your purse or leave one at your desk—refreshing facial mists are about to become your skin’s new BFF! Setting sprays are typically used to help makeup last longer and pull your look together. Sick of your makeup always sliding off halfway through the day? It’s time to invest in a setting spray! Primer sprays are similar in that they can extend the life of your makeup, but they’re meant to be used in place of a regular old makeup primer. If you’re looking for a way to speed up your routine, a primer spray could be the way to go!  Now you have an idea of what each type of spray does, but if you aren’t sure which deserves a spot in your routine, keep reading! We’re breaking down when to reach for each one, plus, how to use them.  ADD A FACIAL MIST TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF…  A facial mist is the perfect addition to your daily routine when you need a midday pick-me-up! In movies, you often see people splashing water on their faces to help jolt them awake. But that doesn’t sound too enjoyable, now does it? Instead, reach for a mist with a refreshing formula and spritz it on anytime you need a wakeup call throughout the day.  Even if you’re feeling totally fresh-faced and well-rested, a facial mist can also come in handy when your skin is feeling a little dry. A quick misting can give dry skin the extra boost it needs. This is particularly helpful during those cold, winter months when skin tends to get dull.  HOW TO USE A FACIAL MIST  We promise: It’s so easy! Just spray your facial mist onto clean skin morning and night before applying moisturizer and as needed during the day (typically, facial mists shouldn’t interfere with your makeup). That’s it!  ADD A SETTING SPRAY TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF…  When you want to rock a “just applied” makeup look all day and night, a setting spray is the way to go! When your contour and your smoky eye are on point, we understand that you’ll try just about anything to maintain your look from desk to drinks. Instead of constantly reapplying or worrying about any makeup faux pas, make locking in your look with a setting spray as the last step in your makeup routine. A setting spray will increase your makeup’s lifespan—which means you can dance the night away without the fear of sweating your foundation off.  A setting spray can also come through in the clutch if you have oily skin. If you do have oily skin, chances are you’re layering on powder makeup to help your makeup stay put throughout the day. A setting spray can help soften the look of all the products you’ve previously applied—giving you the seamless look you’re after! Trust us, if you love powder makeup and layering your look, be sure to complete your beauty routine with a spritz of setting spray.  HOW TO USE A SETTING SPRAY  Once you’re done applying all of your makeup—foundation, concealer, eye shadow, mascara, lipstick, you name it—lightly mist your face with a setting spray to help lock everything in place. You can also use one midday to help refresh your makeup and keep your look lasting even longer.  ADD A PRIMER SPRAY TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF…  Primer sprays are another type of facial spray worthy of adding to your beauty regimen—and they’ve been getting more attention as of late. A primer spray is ideal for those with oily skin. It preps your skin for your makeup application, allowing it to last longer and go on smoother! It’s also a must if you have a big occasion coming up (cough, cough—the holidays) where your makeup fading throughout the night is simply not an option.  HOW TO USE A PRIMER SPRAY  Using a primer spray is as easy as saying your ABC’s and counting to 1, 2, 3! Simply spritz it onto bare skin before applying your makeup—after going through your full skin care routine—and you’re good to go!  OUR BEST FACIAL SPRAYS  Now that you know about the different types of facial sprays, it’s time to add one to your routine!

"CLOSE Bill O’Reilly is mad at a lot of people, including God. Nathan Rousseau Smith (@FantasticMrNate) reports. Buzz60  Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. (Photo: Andy Kropa, AP)  Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly is angrily denying a report that he paid one woman $32 million to settle sexual harassment allegations, blaming a conspiracy to drive him from ""the marketplace"" and even raging against the Almighty.  ""You know, am I mad at God? Yeah, I'm mad at him,"" O'Reilly said Monday in a post on his website. ""I wish I had more protection. I wish this stuff didn't happen. I can't explain it to you. If I die tomorrow and I get an opportunity, I'll say 'why'd you guys work me over like that? Didn't know my children were going to be punished? And they're innocent.'""  The New York Times reported Saturday that O'Reilly paid $32 million to Lis Wiehl, a Fox News legal analyst who made regular appearances on O'Reilly's show for 15 years, in a settlement related to sexual harassment allegations. Wiehl accused O'Reilly of ""repeated harassment, a nonconsensual sexual relationship and the sending of gay pornography and other sexually explicit material to her,"" the Times reported, citing two people briefed on the matter.  On his website, O'Reilly denounced the report as a ""smear piece"" and said ""these people at the New York Times are out to hurt people with whom they disagree. They don't want me in the marketplace. That's what this is all about.""  More: Bill O'Reilly dismisses NYT report as 'lies and smears'  More: Megyn Kelly complained to Fox execs about Bill O'Reilly's sexual harassment stand  In April, the Times reported on five other settlements involving O'Reilly and women accusing him of sexual harassment. The revelation led to Fox News' decision to part ways with its star commentator.  On Monday, O'Reilly said that in more than 20 years he only ""resolved three situations"" and that he did it ""to protect my children from harm.""  O'Reilly has repeatedly said the potential impact on his children is a major reason for his outrage over the Times report.  ""The pain it brings to my children is indescribable,"" O'Reilly told the Times when it interviewed him about the reported $32 million settlement. ""I would give up my life to protect my children, but I find myself unable to protect them because of things that are being said about me, their father.""  ""This is horrible what I went through, horrible what my family went through,"" he continued. O'Reilly said the report was ""politically and financially motivated"" and that he could ""prove it with shocking information but I'm not going to sit here in a courtroom for a year and a half and let my kids get beaten up every single day of their lives by a tabloid press.""  O'Reilly invoked the memory of his former Fox News colleague Eric Bolling's son, 19-year-old Eric Chase Bolling, who was found dead in an apartment while away at college. Fox News had just parted ways with Bolling amid sexual harassment allegations when his son died and O'Reilly seemed to say that was behind the teen's death.  ""I urge you to think about what you put in your newspaper,"" O'Reilly told the Times reporters. ""Eric Bolling's son is dead. Is dead, because of allegations made, in my opinion — and I know this to be true — against Mr. Bolling.""  Separately, Bolling said in a statement that O'Reilly's comment was ""beyond inappropriate"" and that his ""parting from Fox News was in no way connected to the tragic news of my son's passing.""  O'Reilly apologized to Bolling in a tweet. ""The message I tried to send was that allegations harm kids. Nothing more,"" O'Reilly tweeted.  Apologies to Eric Bolling and prayers for him and his family. The message I tried to send was that allegations harm kids. Nothing more. — Bill O'Reilly (@BillOReilly) October 23, 2017  ""Thank Bill, apology accepted,"" Bolling tweeted back.  O'Reilly, on his website, said the Times doesn't care about children and is willing to run a story based on anonymous sources even though ""families are devastated.""  ""So and so said, so and so told me,"" O'Reilly said of the use of unnamed sources. ""That's what they do to Trump every day and that's why Trump is furious. That's why the President of the United States calls out The New York Times by name. But the culture war is that intense.""  ""Bottom line on this is that my enemies who want to silence me have made my life extremely difficult,"" he said.

They are not officially back together but are spending time together again,” a source told E! News last month. “They never stopped speaking after they broke up. They care about each other. They are just seeing what happens.”  Darren also counts another Brit, actress Rachel Weisz, among his exes. They ended their engagement in 2010 after nine years together, and share an 11-year-old son, named Henry."
"Younes Bendjima raised eyebrows after he posted and quickly deleted a snarky comment on a racy Instagram from his girlfriend.  And it seems like Kourtney Kardashian is none too pleased with her younger beau's jealousy.  The 39-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is said to be 'frustrated' with her 25-year-old boyfriend airing out his grievances in a public forum it was reported by E! News on Wednesday.  A source for the entertainment publication said: 'Kourtney doesn't appreciate Younes posting his feelings in a public forum and being impulsive.  Peachy: Kourtney Kardashian, 39, is said to be 'frustrated' with her 25-year-old boyfriend airing out his grievances in a public forum it was reported by E! News on Wednesday after she posted this racy snap two days prior  'She's frustrated that he continues to get upset about it. She isn't going to stop doing what she's doing and feels like he needs to understand and deal with it.'  As the former amateur boxer makes his living scantily-clad in front of the camera it is interesting to note that he would feel this way.  The insider explained: 'Younes gets jealous and can be possessive of Kourtney. When she posts half naked pictures, he gets very upset.  'He wants her for himself and doesn't want to share her with the world.'  Dislike: Her boyfriend, Younes Bendjima, (pictured) is said to not be a fan of her sexy selfies  The two recently returned from a trip in Europe which lasted over several weeks as the male model is said to be 'missing her like crazy and got emotional,' however, Kourtney believes that he needs to get over it as it's part of her job and brand.  The source explained: 'Kourtney has explained its part of her job and it's not going to change. But it still makes him uncomfortable and upset. He overreacted and put up a comment without thinking it through.  'Then he realized what he did made it even worse. He was just not thinking in the moment and got emotional.'  The report comes just two days after the reality star posted a very revealing snap o her curves on Instagram on Monday.  She proudly flaunted her bodacious figure in a floral patterned thong bikini as she posed with her back to the camera while kneeling on the grass.  Contradiction? As Younes is a male model he often posts snaps of himself scantily-clad  However one person who doesn't seem to be the fan of the image is her 25-year-old model boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  According to The Shade Room, the model deleted a comment on the snap which said: 'that's what you need to show to get likes?'  On Monday, PEOPLE reported he has never been a fan of Kourtney's 'sexy pictures on social media.'  'He doesn't want his girlfriend to do that,' a source told the magazine. 'He gets that it's her job, but he has always had a problem with this. This is the stuff that made them split in the past.'  Bendjima publicly expressed his dislike when he commented on the reality star's most recent Instagram post, writing: 'This is what you need to show to get likes?'  Younes' comment has since been deleted.  Several of the KUWTK star's pals including sister Kendall Jenner and model Bella Hadid approved.  'Yes tooshie,' Kendall wrote.  'Wow. Yup,' Bella said.  And Blink-182's drummer Travis Barker commented on the image with a single hand clap emoji.  'He doesn't want his girlfriend to do that,' a source told the magazine.

Her raven-colored tresses were worn down under the fashionable headwear as she let her natural looks show by wearing minimal make-up.  Kourtney captioned the racy image: 'don’t be shady, be a lady.'

"ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.  A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.  Launch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.  The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.  Related 'The Chew' Canceled on ABC Abby Huntsman Joins 'The View' as Co-Host  “Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.  “GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.  The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.  Haines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six."

The 41-year-old Oscar winner (and younger brother of Ben Affleck) and 38-year-old actress Summer (the younger sister of Joaquin and the late River Phoenix) split in 2015.  However it was only on Monday that Summer officially filed for divorce from her husband.  According to E! News, Summer has cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for wanting a divorce.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: PA)  The news comes two years after the couple separated - although they only made their separation public in 2016.  Summer and Casey have two sons together - 13-year-old Indiana and nine-year-old Atticus.  The soon-to-be-ex-husband and wife originally began dating back in 1999 - when Summer was in a relationship with someone else, but her brother Joaquin encouraged Casey to pursue her.  (Image: Splash News)  ""She was going out with someone else and I said, 'Man, she's cute,' and [Joaquin] said, 'You should see if she'll go out with you… don't worry about that dude,’” Casey told The Daily Beast in 2013.  The pair tied-the-knot in 2006 - and had performed together in the 2000 film Committed and a 2002 stage production of This Is Our Youth.  Since October 2016, Casey has been in a relationship with actress Floriana Lima, 36."

"THE joke was a quick one. It showed Family Guy’s infant Stewie running naked screaming, “Help! I’ve escaped from Kevin Spacey’s basement!”  But that 2005 animated clip went viral when Spacey was accused of assaulting several young men in a November 2017 bombshell that lost the 58-year-old actor his House Of Cards gig and led him to “seek evaluation and treatment”.  Family Guy creator, and star, Seth MacFarlane said on Thursday at the Television Critics Association’s Winter Press Tour he wasn’t the one who pitched the controversial joke that made its way into the years-old episode and left many fans wondering what MacFarlane knew about Spacey ahead of the public revelations.  “I don’t remember who pitched the joke,” he told reporters on Thursday. “I remember when it was pitched that was a rumour that I had actually not heard, and other writers in the writers’ room had. It had to be explained to me.”  Showrunner Alec Sulkin said he too wasn’t the one who came up with it, but he remembered a bit more about its genesis. He said the timing of the quip came because Spacey initially said he had been attacked by a young person in London one night in 2004. Later, he changed his story and said he tripped over his dog after the young person mugged him.  “I think he had sort of been beaten up in a London park and he claimed he was walking his dog and fell and I think that sort of raised a lot of eyebrows,” Sulkin recalled.  MacFarlane insisted the show doesn’t have a sixth sense running the writers’ room.  “The idea that Family Guy is this cartoon Ouija board that predicts things … I was just watching things happen from afar,” he told the room full of journalists on Thursday. “I think it’s sort of modern media. The idea that it’s more important to be first than to be right. It’s a strange thing to observe. We write our show the same way as everyone else. We make the same kind of topical jokes that The Simpsons does, [that] South Park does. And you work with what you have whether that be swirling rumours or political [material].”  The show previously made headlines for a 2009 quip in which Stewie called then Bruce Jenner “an elegant, beautiful Dutch woman”. In 2015, the former Olympian opened up about being transgender and began using the name Caitlyn Jenner.  “The myth that Family Guy is this Kreskin-like prognosticator of this kind of stuff is a little bit sensationalised,” MacFarlane insisted.  The show is currently celebrating its upcoming 300th episode.  “I don’t know that anyone ever really expected this show to go this long,” he added.  He said the show has evolved “with the times” which has enabled it to succeed.  This story originally appeared on Fox News and is republished here with permission."
"The wait for Swifties is finally over.  After much, much speculation, Taylor Swift finally announced her sixth studio album, “Reputation,” on Wednesday. The album will be released on Nov. 10, with its first single dropping on Thursday night.  Swift posted the cover art for “Reputation” on her social media accounts.  Multiple sources told Variety that new music was coming this week, although Swift was expected to make the announcement on Friday.  The popstar had kept fans on their toes since last week. Last Friday, the third anniversary of the day she announced her first pop album — “1989” — and unveiled its debut single — “Shake It Off” — she deleted every post on her Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts. This past Monday, she shared a cryptic 10-second video of a reptilian tail on social media.  Also significant: the MTV Video Music Awards are this Sunday. It’s been rumored that Swift will also release a video for the new song at the ceremony.  It’s been three years since Swift debuted the mega-selling “1989,” marking the longest break between albums since she debuted her first in 2006. She typically releases a new album every two years. Swift most recently collaborated with Zayn Malik on “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever” for the “Fifty Shades Darker” soundtrack this year. She’s kept an unusually low profile over the past few months, posting sporadically on social media and making few public appearances."
"Karrueche Tran Judge Grants 5 Year Restraining Order Against Chris Brown  Karrueche Tran Granted Five Year Restraining Order Against Chris Brown  EXCLUSIVE  12:01 PM PT -- The judge just sided with Tran ... ordering the restraining order stay in place for the next 5 years. Chris Brown threatened violence against his ex-GF after they broke up, demanding she give back money and gifts he had given her during their relationship ... this according to Karrueche Tran's in-person testimony in court.  Karrueche took the stand Thursday in her restraining order case against Chris, telling a judge after she broke up with the singer ... he demanded diamond rings he bought for her to be returned. When she refused ... Karrueche says Chris became aggressive.  Karrueche explained that in text messages between herself and Chris post-breakup, he would say things like ""I'm not being nice to you no more, if I see you out in public again and I'm there I will make you hate me even more, don't be anywhere I'm out in public, I'm going to ban you from all events.""  She claims he also texted her more violent threats like ... ""I can get my money back and I'm tired of playing games"" as well as ""Bitch I will beat the s**t out of you"" and ""I promise you I will make your life hell."" She says he also once wrote ""Imma kill blood"" under a photo of her and actor Michael B. Jordan.  Karrueche also testified that Chris had beaten her before.  Chris Brown's attorney, David Gammill, grilled Karrueche on cross-examination, and pressed her on allegedly taunting Chris about the rings by saying she had sold them. Karrueche told Gammill she never planned to return the rings because they were hers. Gammill also brought up the point of Karrueche never reporting any of the alleged behavior to authorities.  Karrueche insists she fears for her safety and needs permanent protection. Chris wasn't in court today and the judge refused to let him join the hearing via phone."

"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday urged Congress to hike the hourly minimum wage dramatically.Noting that Wall Street this week is trading at record-high levels, the California Democrat said those gains have done nothing to benefit middle-class workers, and called on Congress to close the gap.""This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the stock market soaring to record heights. At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,"" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. ""But we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.""ADVERTISEMENTPelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. She urged Congress to take up legislation — sponsored by Sen.(D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) — to hike the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, while indexing future increases to inflation.""If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,"" she said, ""we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.""The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour. Harkin said recently that Obama ""missed the mark"" with the lower figure.Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low (43.5 percent of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 8 percent for roughly six months.Economists say several factors can explain why corporate profits are not trickling down to benefit the working class, including the ever-rising productivity of the nation's workforce and a reluctance among companies to hire in a still-volatile economy.Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was conditioned on the inclusion of $5 billion in business tax breaks. The package was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.With the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage hike wold cripple hiring amid a jobs crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill has little chance of moving through the GOP-controlled House. But Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping the combination of soaring Wall Street gains and middle-class wage stagnation will resonate with voters.""When we increased it in 2007 ... it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years,"" Pelosi said. ""It's time for it to be increased again."""

"  Oprah Winfrey takes part in a town hall meeting with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in Marietta, Georgia, Nov. 1. (Chris Aluka Berry/Reuters)  Contributing opinion writer  A political mentor had a saying when he looked at a good political commercial: “There’s votes in that spot.” That phrase came back to me yesterday when I saw Oprah Winfrey say, “This land was made for you and me.” The phrase makes a powerful rallying cry for a lot of Democrats in 2018 and beyond, and the reigning queen of all media rolled out this line while stumping for Stacey Abrams in the race for governor in Georgia.  While Winfrey has denied interest in running for office herself, the rumor that she will lingers. The rumor itself isn’t all that interesting. But listening to her yesterday, I thought her candidacy for president would be fascinating.  The Democrats have a number of high-profile candidates who have been mentioned to take on the Republicans’ reality-show star in 2020, many of whom rose outside of politics. In addition to Winfrey, there is Howard Schultz of Starbucks, actor Tom Hanks, former New York City mayor and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg and Disney’s Bob Iger.  Trump, of course, knows Winfrey well, having appeared on her show. And he’s had nice things to say about her in the past. He undoubtedly still envies her mastery of branding and media as she built an empire after starting as a local newscaster in Nashville. Lately, he hasn’t been as kind, calling her “insecure” and saying he would love to run against her because (cue innuendo) he knows her “weakness.”  But Trump presumably knows her strengths, too. She has spent a lifetime interviewing people and understands how to give meaning to the struggles and aspirations of a wide cross section of Americans. If Trump is our national storyteller for fear and loathing, Winfrey is ours for hope and striving. Trump screams about an America under siege and beset by internal and external enemies; Winfrey has spent a lifetime in conversation with us about how we are all redeemable and that we can all have our piece of the pie.  It may be unlikely, but a presidential race which pits the slogan, “Make America Great Again: The Sequel” against “This land was made for you and me” would get huge ratings and present our country with a very clear choice. Time will tell how the show plays out.  Read more:  Carter Eskew: Are there any thoroughbreds in the Democratic presidential field?  Carter Eskew: A better closing argument for Democrats"

"Mariah Carey may now be wishing things would have worked out with her billionaire ex-fiancé James Packer! The singer’s high-end SoCal shopping spree turned “embarrassing” when her credit cards were declined, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.  “She was shopping on Rodeo Drive and her credit cards were declined,” an eyewitness told Radar. “When it happened at Louis Vuitton she thought it was a fluke. But when it happened three more times she was embarrassed and humiliated.”  Carey, 47, played it off like it was a mistake, as she left and came back to purchase the high-end items.  PHOTOS: Mariah Carey Caught Making Out With Ex Boytoy Bryan Tanaka  “She returned with an assistant and her manager Stella [Bulochnikov], who made a total scene,” the eyewitness said.  Bulochnikov is the lucky standup comedian-turned-music manager who was on the receiving end of Carey’s once-hefty bank account when the singer shelled out a whopping $34,000 on a Louis Vuitton trunk for her 44th birthday.  Yet, despite her cards not going through this time around, Carey didn’t walk away empty-handed.  PHOTOS: Sorry, Nick! Mariah Carey Is Dating Bryan Tanaka Again  “They ended up paying cash,” said the source. “But Mariah is blaming her manager for the cancelations, postponement and low ticket sales of her tour with Lionel Richie. She’s also had bad press and business deals. Stella keeps saying everything is going to be all right, but it’s not.”  This isn’t the only bad luck in the bucks department the Grammy winner has faced recently.  The superstar has spent millions she may not have on her new boy toy Bryan Tanaka only after she called off her South American shows because of late payments. She is currently suing the concert promoter.  PHOTOS: Turning Heads! Curvy Mariah Carey Busts Out Of Sheer Top In Barcelona  The music legend also only raked in $6.3 million in 2014 and demanded $50 million from her former businessman beau Packer after their engagement imploded.

More than 10 years after she first guest-starred on the original run of the hit NBC comedy, the multitalented star will appear on Thursday's episode in two separate roles: She'll play both herself and NYPD detective Harlee Santos, her character on NBC's ""Shades of Blue.""  Back in 2004, Lopez, 48, appeared as herself on several episodes of the show, even singing at Karen and Lyle’s Vegas wedding in the season 6 finale.  On Thursday's episode, Jack (Sean Hayes) nabs a small acting job — playing a corpse in a morgue! — on an episode of ""Shades of Blue.""  In the first preview clip, Jack tells Karen (Megan Mullally) how he plans to use his experience on set to reunite with his BFFF.  ""Your Best Famous Friend Forever who hasn't spoken to you in 10 years, changed her email, phone number and address and returned the creepy fan art you painted?"" Karen asks.  ""Yes, that's the one! Jenny from the Block Me on All Social Media!"" Jack says happily.  Jack (Sean Hayes) tried to get in on the act when Jennifer Lopez performed in a 2004 episode of ""Will & Grace.""

"Jax and Brittany are taking Versailles. Vanderpump Rules stars Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor have booked their wedding venue, and the location is one fans should’ve seen coming 2,000 miles away. Brittany has said time and time again that she has always wanted to get married at the Kentucky Castle in Versailles, Kentucky, and what do you know? That is precisely where she and Jax will tie the knot. As Jax shared on Instagram on Thursday, Brittany’s dreams of getting married at the Sexy Unique Spot are officially coming true. And whew, the IG video of Jax and Brittany's wedding venue sure is something to behold.  “Well venue set, deposit paid,” Jax wrote on IG. “Now I need a drink....bad.” He also posted a video to Instagram Stories he took while he and Brittany celebrated the financial commitment they just made. ""Just got the total of the wedding!!!"" he wrote on the Story. ""Gonna need more tequila!!""  Once the sticker shock wore off, Jax let his excitement take the reins. He tweeted on Friday,  “Can’t believe I am getting married in a castle that is all ours for three nights.. you can’t see the amazing pool in the back but it’s absolutely gorgeous. Gonna be a weekend to remember! #thekentuckycastle”  Without further ado, please enjoy this video of a reality star who just booked the wedding venue of her dreams.  What at thrilling SUR-lwind the last few months have been. Jax and Brittany got engaged on June 7, and the couple immediately began plotting their wedding. Just a few weeks after the proposal happened, Jax and Brittany revealed they'd begun drafting their guest list, hired two wedding planners, started working with a wedding publicist, and attempted to figure out who would be in their wedding party.  When speaking with People back in July, Brittany revealed that the process of picking her bridesmaids was really putting her through it. She said,  “I have so many really close friends, from home in Kentucky and here in L.A., so making my bridesmaid choices down to like eight [people] is going to be really hard for me because my list is at like 15 right now. So, that’s going to be the hardest thing.”  While tasks like finalizing the guest list and the wedding party have been tough, choosing the wedding location was a breeze. As Brittany explained in the aforementioned People interview,  “I’ve known where I wanted to get married since I was a little kid. I’ve talked about it on the show. Even in other seasons, I wanted to get married at the Kentucky Castle so I don’t think that’s a surprise.""  She always knew it was going to be the Kentucky Castle. We fans knew it was going to be the Kentucky Castle. And now, Jax and Brittany's wallets know it's going to be the Kentucky Castle.  Speaking of dreams, if the Bravo cameras are not part of Jax and Brittany's castle wedding day, it will be a true nightmare. Come on, the Jason ""Jax Taylor"" Cauchi is getting married. In a castle. This is the content we Pump fiends crave."
"They both recently endured very public break-ups.

Not everyone is thrilled about the union, however, as The Leftover star's ex Jennifer Aniston is reportedly 'not happy about' his romance with the singer/actress, who has long considered the Friends star 'a mentor.'  Blossoming romance? Selena Gomez and Justin Theroux are reportedly 'more than friends,' according to Life & Style, and are 'totally falling for each other'  The insider explained that the Fetish singer and Mulholland Drive actor have 'known each other for years through their manager,' but now they are totally 'are falling for each other.'  While the couple share a nearly 20-years age difference, they were able to connect over their recent break-ups and the source said 'sparks fly' when they're together.  Selena split from on-off ex Justin Bieber after a brief reunion last Fall, which happened right on the heels of her split from rapper The Weeknd, who now appears to have reunited with his former flame Bella Hadid.  Theroux and Aniston announced their divorce in February after two years of marriage.  Unhappy: The Leftover star's ex Jennifer Aniston is reportedly'not happy about' his romance with the singer/actress, who has long considered the Friends star 'a mentor,' seen together in 2015 above  They've got chemistry! While the couple share a nearly 20-years age difference, they were able to connect over their recent break-ups and the source said 'sparks fly' when they're together. The duo is seen with actor Paul Rudd in 2015 above  'Initially, they leaned on each other for emotional support after going through messy breakups,' explained the source but now the duo are smitten.  'They FaceTime and text late at night and have intimate conversation about where they're going in life and their career goals,' the insider revealed, 'They're extremely honest and open with each other.'  But apparently friends of the Kill 'Em With Kindness singer are not keen on the relationship, thinking it can only end badly.  Meanwhile, Aniston is reportedly livid about the romance, with the source saying: 'Jen is not happy about it.'  Beside herself: The source said Aniston, above with Theroux in 2017, would 'be horrified,' if she knew the extent of his relationship with Gomez  The source said 'she'd be horrified,' if she knew the extent of the relationship because 'She'd think of it as a complete betrayal on both their parts.'  Selena was first friends with Aniston, who she met in 2009 and quickly connected with, even going as far as calling herself 'obsessed' with the star.  And insiders say that's one of the reasons she's so taken with the much-older actor.  'Part of her attraction to Justin is knowing how much Jen loved him. The fact that the woman she idolized so much prized him only makes Justin all that more appealing."

"Dean Geyer and Jillian Murray are officially husband and wife!  The entertainers — who got engaged last December — exchanged custom vows in front of 75 of their closest family and friends at a boutique venue in Santa Ynez Valley on Thursday, PEOPLE can exclusively reveal.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “She is the love of my life,” Geyer said before the wedding. “She is gorgeous, strong, hardworking and always the life of the party.”  “Having my husband write me the most beautiful vows to me and then sing to me later in the evening was the highlight of my entire event,”says Murray. Adds Geyer: “I thought I’d already seen Jillian at her most gorgeous, but her in that dress walking down the aisle took the meaning of hot to the next level!”  Jana Williams Photography  The Glee and Australian Idol alum, 31, and the Code Black actress, 33, met on the set of their film Never Back Down 2 seven years ago. “From the beginning, I knew I liked her,” says Geyer. Now after nearly a decade together, “we share the same beliefs, countless interests and passions.”  Murray and Geyer are self-proclaimed “foodies” and splurged on fresh ingredients and a decadent menu by Field to Table catering. “We’re taking things from the garden we’re getting married in and actually cooking it for the guests,” says Murray, who kicked off the cocktail hour with bacon-wrapped dates, truffle mac ‘n’ cheese and grilled cheese dippers with tomato soup.  Jillian Murray  For dessert, the couple are serving chocolate chip cookies and three different wedding cakes (including butterscotch, cookie dough and brownie) by Enjoy Cupcakes.  The pair’s reception featured designs by Rrivre Davies of Rrivre Works, and the overall theme was “super glamorous in nature,” says Murray. “The vision I had on my Pinterest, he found a way to blend it. He’s literally the reason I have the wedding of my dreams.”  Decor for the big day (planned by Lindsay Longacre of LVL Weddings) featured a custom-made structure with chandeliers, all-white flowers and greenery (by Precious & Blooming) and a custom-furnished lounge section for their guests to relax. The couple served cocktails by On the Rocks and hired Bella Vista for lighting.  “We wanted it to be open so you can see the stars and appreciate where you are out in the middle of nowhere,” says Geyer.  FROM PEN: All about Drew Scott and Linda Phan’s destination wedding – guess where they’re tying the knot?  Geyer (in a Hugo Boss tuxedo and bowtie) did not see his new bride until she walked down the aisle to live music by the Santa Barbara String Quartet. “She wants the waterworks!” joked the actor before the ceremony. Murray kept her gown — which was her “biggest splurge” for the wedding — under wraps for months.  “I saw the dress and I started crying. It wasn’t even on me yet,” she said of picking it out. “This was obviously the one.”"

"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie Are Today’s New Anchor Team  As for future projects, Couric is focused on her new documentary series as well as her popular podcast — and teaching her husband John Molner about social media.  “I’m having so much fun doing my podcast with my friend Brian Goldsmith,” she says. “I’ve been able to have extended and substantive conversations with so many great, interesting people, like Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Alec Baldwin, David Axelrod, Ava DuVernay and Ina Garten. And now we’re ‘dropping’ episodes weekly. Coming up: Laverne Cox and Amy Schumer.  “Meanwhile, I’m still happily married (after three years!) and I’m teaching John how to do Instagram stories,” she continues. “His are pretty lame so far. I’m also getting ready for my younger daughter Carrie’s college graduation. (GULP!) And there are some other cool projects I’ll be able to announce soon. I’m addicted to work!"
"Miranda Lambert is currently dating Evan Felker – a married man – and her ex Blake Shelton is apparently thrilled that everyone finally knows she is a homewrecker. Even though rumors are swirling he is ready to wed Gwen Stefani, Shelton has been throwing shade at Lambert online. And, according to industry insiders, the feud between the country superstars is escalating. But, Lambert isn’t going to quietly put up with Shelton’s attacks anymore.  After the news of Lambert’s new relationship broke, Shelton posted a cryptic tweet about karma, and sources say it was exactly what everyone thought it was – a direct shot at Lambert. And, it appears that The Voice coach is getting a lot of joy out of Lambert’s embarrassment because for him this is personal.  @blakeshelton #countrymusicfreakstour gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Mar 14, 2018 at 3:28pm PDT  “Blake is reveling in Miranda’s humiliation now that she’s been accused of having an affair with a married man because he believes she cheated on him,” claims the insider.  Even though they have been apart for three years, sources say the feud continues between Shelton and Lambert, and he believes that she will never change. The 41-year-old believes in the “once a cheater always a cheater” theory.  The Hollywood Gossip is reporting that Shelton thinks that his ex is the same person she has always been and that includes her “twisted relationship antics.”  The country community basically sided with Shelton after the split, but he apparently feels like he came off as the villain. Reports claimed that he filed for divorce back in 2015 and she came home to find all of her things outside of their Oklahoma house. Because of that, many made him out to be the bad guy. But, even though he feels Lambert “played the victim,” he thought he had a good reason to send Lambert packing.  Now, Shelton thinks the Tin Man singer is getting exactly what she deserves, and if she is embarrassed about the allegations that she ran off with another woman’s husband, then it is “sweet justice.”  Miranda Lambert's Ex Says She Cheated With Blake Shelton (via @Fox411) https://t.co/Xy5a8tjtkJ — TMZ (@TMZ) May 1, 2018  However, calling it justice may be a bit much, considering the fact that Shelton admitted to falling in love with Lambert while he was still married to his first wife. One source even calls him a “hypocrite.”  Lambert still denies that she ever cheated on Shelton, and she also doesn’t believe she had anything to do with the breakup of Felker’s marriage. So, she won’t be sitting around and taking Shelton’s jabs much longer. Insiders say it is only a matter of time before she retaliates and return fire.  Advertisement  Sources say that the divorce deeply shook both Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton and it doesn’t appear either one will ever get over it. They will apparently be “trading insults, put-downs, and breakup songs for a long time to come.”"
"Barack Obama has decided to spend his retirement years planning a coup against his own government. In the past two weeks, after receiving a...“NOS” stands for “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama’s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren’t your friends. Get out of the house and don’t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves."
"Paris Hilton believes she could be like Princess Diana (Picture: Getty images)  Paris Hilton has opened up about her infamous sex tape, and how she could have been like Princess Diana if it hadn’t have been leaked.  Yes, you read that right.  The 37-year-old compared herself to the people’s princess during a candid interview on Netflix’s The American Meme.  She said: ‘It’s really hurtful, because my whole life I really looked up to Princess Diana, all these elegant, amazing women, and I feel like [Rick] just took that all away from me.  ‘I could have been like that, but because of that tape, I will always be judged and thought of as whatever they say about me because of a private moment between my boyfriend and me.’  Her infamous sex tape with ex Rick Salomon, was distributed by Vivid Entertainment in 2004, and helped secure the rising talent a place on the celebrity map.

Paris was brave enough to tell her truth.  ‘In the first conversation we had about the film, she told me, “I don’t give a shit anymore.”‘  He continued: ‘I want to do something that is real, that has impact. Young people live in the now and you want to be relevant and have your name out there.  ‘People don’t really think about the long-term repercussions, which is why Paris is sharing moments from her earlier life, where she made mistakes or trusted people she shouldn’t have that took advantage of her.

"Nearly three months ago, Jimmy Kimmel broke down in tears during a powerful monologue on his late-night show about his newborn son’s recent open heart surgery.  His candor drew much-needed attention to the importance of providing all Americans, especially those with pre-existing conditions like his son, with adequate health care.  On Friday, Kimmel took to Twitter to share the first photo of William “Billy” Kimmel since opening up about his health struggles.  “Billy is 3 months old & doing great. Thx for the love & support. Please remind your Congresspeople that every kid deserves the care he got,” Kimmel wrote alongside a photo of his smiling baby boy.  Billy is 3 months old & doing great. Thx for the love & support.

The newborn underwent a successful open-heart surgery at just three days old and returned home six days later.  “Before 2014, if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was,” Kimmel explained at the time, “there was a good chance you’d never be able to get health insurance because you had a pre-existing condition.”  The speech quickly went viral as the Republican-dominated Senate debated repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a new health care plan that threatens to cut funding for millions, especially for those with pre-existing conditions.  He also revealed that his son will likely needed an additional surgery somewhere between the ages of 3- and 6-months-old."

"Matthew James Morrison (born October 30, 1978)[1] is an American actor, dancer, and singer-songwriter. Morrison is known for starring in multiple Broadway and Off-Broadway productions, including his portrayal of Link Larkin in Hairspray on Broadway, and for his role as Will Schuester on the Fox television show Glee (2009–2015). Morrison is signed with Adam Levine's 222 Records. Morrison received a Tony Award nomination for his featured role as Fabrizio Nacarelli in the musical The Light in the Piazza. From March 2015 to January 2016, Morrison starred in the lead role of J.M. Barrie in the Broadway production of Finding Neverland.  Early life [ edit ]  Morrison was born in Fort Ord, California, the son of Mary Louise (Fraser) and Thomas Morrison.[2] Morrison was raised in Chico, California, and has Scottish and English ancestry.[3][4] He was part of the Collaborative Arts Project 21 (CAP21) and the Orange County High School of the Arts, while at the Los Alamitos High School campus. While in high school, Morrison did a musical with actress Jodie Sweetin. He attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts for two years before dropping out and joining the Broadway adaptation of Footloose.[5]  By freshman year of college, Morrison already was a regular performer on Broadway. He said in Details, ""There were all these beautiful, beautiful dancers. As a straight guy I had some room. There were the shared interests in singing and dancing, and I always find dancing with someone very erotic and sexual. I definitely hooked up with a lot of girls when I was a young guy on Broadway.""[6]  Career [ edit ]  Morrison's career began when he made his musical theatre debut on Broadway in the musical version of Footloose, followed by a revival of The Rocky Horror Show in 2002.

"I want to have it all,” Jennifer Aniston declared in 2006 about juggling a career and a family. “The women that inspire me are the ones who have careers and children; why would I want to limit myself? I’ve never in my life said I didn’t want to have children. I did and I do and I will!” Well, here we are over a decade later, and Jen is ready to make that happen... with Brad Pitt!  “The two have grown closer over the last couple of years,” a friend told In Touch exclusively. “His marriage [to Angelina Jolie] fell apart, then her marriage to Justin [Theroux] ended. During that difficult time, Brad and Jen reconnected. It’s like destiny brought them together, and I can definitely see them having a child together.”  Of course, Brad is already a father of six, and admitted that “Being a father has changed me on so many levels and made me more generous and alive.” Jen is 49 and has never had children, so Brad could surely help her through it. “He and Jen have talked about moving in together and giving this another try,” said the insider. “This could all lead to her finally having his baby.” Brad “has babies on the brain. He loves being a dad. It’s a huge part of who he is.”  Because of Jen’s age, the chances of conceiving naturally are extremely slim, “But they would try,” said her pal. If that doesn’t work, they would move on to IVF. “Even if it meant months of trying IVF. When Jen sets her mind to something, she doesn’t stop until she succeeds.” After their long and heartbreaking journey away from and now back to each other, “It’s the blockbuster news that friends, family and fans have been hoping for.”  Of course, the idea infuriates Angie. “It’s the ultimate slap in the face,” said an insider. But they won’t let Angelina stop them, “I think the more they talk about starting a family, the more it makes sense.” (A rep for Jen denied the story, while a rep for Brad had no comment.) “They both have changed over the years and, after much heartache, are at a great place in their lives,” said the friend. “Brad loves the idea of how they’d both come full circle and found each other again. Having a child together seems like the perfect next step.”  They're different people now, and could give them the chance to right some wrongs. “One of Jen’s greatest regrets is that they never had a baby together when they were married,” said the friend. “Jen and Brad tried midway through their marriage, but she lost the baby and they were heartbroken. She’s been wanting a baby ever since, but it just hasn’t come together for her.”  Jen has decided to sell her $25 million Bel Air mansion (which recently was featured on the cover of Architectural Digest) and plans to move into Brad’s Pacific Palisades home so they can be under one roof. “Jen and Brad are seizing the now-or-never moment. They’re ready.”  Read more about Jen and Brad's baby plans in this week's issue of In Touch Weekly, on newsstands now!

"Bono has said that US presidential nominee Donald Trump could potentially “destroy” America.  In an interview with Charlie Rose on US network CBS, the U2 front man said Trump is “potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America”.  Bono said America is different from other countries because it is “an idea”, one which Trump is “trying to hijack”.  “That idea is bound up in justice and equality for all. I think he’s hijacked the party.  “I think he’s trying to hijack the idea of America. And I think it’s bigger than all of us. I think this is really dangerous.”  In a separate interview with ATTN, an online media company aimed at younger people, Bono has recalled the historic struggle of Irish immigrants to the United States in calling on the country’s political leaders to open its doors to Syrian refugees.  He said that to turn people away just because they are refugees was “a betrayal of the whole idea of America”.  “The promised land belongs to those who need it most. The Irish needed it. The Jews needed it. The Syrians now need it,” he said in an interview.  Asked about US political opposition to accepting refugees into the country, Bono said: “I’m Irish. It’s deeply offensive. We were economic refugees. This thing of a continent behaving like an island, this shrivel and pretend the world doesn’t exist, it’s not possible any more in a globalized world. It’s just not possible.”"
"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  We're all still grieving the loss of Milo Ventimiglia's Jack Pearson on ""This Is Us,"" even though we're excited to see him return next season.  But as Ventimiglia recently told The Los Angeles Times, his death scene wasn't just hard on him — his co-star, Mandy Moore, was ""crying every day"" for ""four weeks.""  Jack's (Milo Ventimiglia) death scenes were particularly hard on Mandy Moore, who plays his wife, Rebecca, on ""This Is Us."" NBC  ""What I understood in my scene is it's very much not about me,"" he explained. ""It's about what Mandy (who plays Jack's wife Rebecca) has to experience in finding that ultimate low ... Hearing my friend completely break, it almost felt like an out-of-body experience. It hurt; it was painful.""  Jack was a true hero for rescuing his family from a house fire, but ultimately succumbed once he was at the hospital, which meant Moore had a lot of emotional scenes and a lot of tears to shed.  ""Poor Mandy had about four weeks where she was crying every day,"" he recalled.  We're going to miss seeing Jack and Rebecca snuggling! Ron Batzdorff/NBC  And it's not as if Ventimiglia was taking a nap, lying on the hospital bed while she wept over him. ""It's about remaining still,"" he said about playing dead. ""I just focus on a spot on the ceiling and relax the muscles in my face.""  Afterward, the ""This Is Us"" actor says he gave Moore some room to recover from all that crying.  ""I just waited until she came and knocked on my trailer door (once filming was done),"" he said. ""We had a big hug and there was laughter and even a, 'Thank God that's over.'""

"Princess Kate knew what was coming.  Having battled severe pregnancy sickness, or Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG), while expecting her first two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, the royal mom would have been told by her medical team that the odds meant she would likely have the debilitating condition again.  Caitlin Dean, who is chairperson of the U.K.’s Pregnancy Sickness Support, is also a mother of three who suffered from HG in each of her pregnancies.  “A lot of people go into the second [pregnancy] hoping that it will not happen again, thinking [HG] will be one pregnancy and that every pregnancy is different,” says Dean. “But once you have it twice, that delusion is pretty much blown out of the water. So you have to prepare and be ready for this.  “For myself, I found it mentally and physically easier [during subsequent pregnancies] because I knew that I was going to have this and I knew what to expect from the treatment and what to expect generally.”  Lia Toby/WENN  On the flip side, she notes, for some women the symptoms “get worse each time.”  Dean says that for women who have previously battled HG, there’s a trepidation mixed in with the joy of anticipating a new baby.  “You know it’s coming, and it’s quite a scary prospect knowing you’re going to put yourself through that again. Certainly for me and my husband that was a huge decision. Not so much, ‘Let’s have a third kid,’ but, ‘Can we go through HG again?’ It’s certainly something that limits a lot of people who cannot go beyond two because of the condition.  “Preparing makes a huge amount of difference,” she adds. “What we suspect from experience is that if you prepare, you can start pre-emptive treatment and can prepare your household and your finances. The average woman doesn’t have the life that Kate has with people to cook meals and people to do their cleaning for them and look  after their children. For regular women that preparation is absolutely key.”  Such advance preparation, she adds, “doesn’t necessarily improve the sickness, although there is evidence that earlier treatment can reduce the overall impact of the symptoms. It isn’t a cure, but it makes it easier to have done that preparation. Then, if you don’t have HG on the third time, you haven’t lost anything. [That scenario] would be brilliant. Very occasionally women don’t get it again, but most of the time they do.”  Preparing also means keeping your younger children informed, says Dean, who wrote How To Be an HG Hero aimed at children of expectant moms.  Photo by Samir Hussein/WireImage  “The idea with that is to help children understand why Mummy’s not in the picture and why she’s potentially in and out of hospital and how they can help,” says Dean. “My key thing is honesty. A lot of people try to hide the fact they’re pregnant in the first 12 weeks, because they’re worried about having to explain a miscarriage if it happens. If you are going in and out of hospital and lying in bed day after day and not telling your kids the reason why, they’re just going to worry about it and make up in their own heads why that is. Kids are resilient and they get on with that as long as you tell them the truth.  “It is debilitating and miserable and hopefully [Kate’s] children will not be worrying about it and understand that Mummy’s poorly.”  Samir Hussein/WireImage  Of course, it’s also tough on moms. “You have the fact that your other children are going to lose out on Mummy, and you have that guilt at not being able to spend so much time with them.”  As for treatment, guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists include a first line of medication like Cyclizine, which is an anti-histamine and works to combat vomiting, and Ondansetron to prevent nausea and vomiting.  “On top of that, it is IV fluids ­if she’s not keeping food or fluids down,” says Dean, who is not involved in Kate’s treatment. “The main things is to keep her hydrated and able to eat. We know that malnutrition and dehydration can have a negative effect on the fetus. The idea that baby’s fine with a starving mum just isn’t true. It is important to keep mums hydrated so that they can eat as much as they need to or are able to.”"
"The battle between Farrah Abraham and Teen Mom isn’t over yet.  After announcing she was “moving on” from the MTV series last month, blasting the show as “hateful” and “horrible,” the reality star is taking legal action, suing parent company Viacom for $5 million.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  According to court documents obtained by The Blast, Abraham claims she was fired because of her decision to work in the adult entertainment industry. The 26-year-old previously released sex tapes with Vivid Entertainment in 2013 and 2014 with porn star James Deen, and since then, she has done adult webcam shows and appearances at strip clubs. She has also endorsed sex toys.  “We respect Farrah’s decision to pursue other endeavors and we wish her the best,” a Viacom spokesperson tells PEOPLE. “Regarding her suit, the claims are without merit.”  In the complaint, Abraham, who is mom to 8-year-old daughter Sophia, alleges Viacom “wrongfully terminated her employment because she did not conform to gender stereotypes.”  Farrah Abraham Rodrigo Varela/Getty  According to Abraham, in October 2017 she was confronted by 16 & Pregnant and Teen Mom executive producer Morgan J. Freeman at her Texas home, where she alleges she was “harassed, humiliated, discriminated against, disrespected, ridiculed, degraded and sex shamed” for her “recent decision to pursue opportunities in the adult entertainment industry.”  Abraham alleges Freeman and his production crew made threats about “ending her career with MTV, sabotaging future deals [she] had in place with MTV, and defaming her.” She claims she “feared for her life” during the confrontation due to Freeman’s “hostile tone, mannerisms, and body language.”  Abraham alleges that shortly after the confrontation, production informed her she was no longer needed for the show.  She claims the harassment from the producers based on their “gender stereotypes of how women should act and appear, unreasonably interfered” with her work performance and psychological well-being.  The reality star is suing for emotional pain, emotional suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life and other damages. She also alleges gender discrimination and a hostile work environment and says she’s still owed money that was guaranteed in her contract.  Last month, the MTV personality made multiple accusations against the network in a scathing Instagram post alongside a Teen Mom OG clip of her speaking with Morgan, who said she was a “problem” to work with.  “Never apologize for being an ambitious, confident, and strong minded women,” she wrote. “As I become the best Farrah I can be, I won’t let a man or network be little me, try to break me, lie about who I am to my core, I’m bullied, surrounded & hurt by all the manipulation, I no longer will allow as a protective mother this vulgar behavior, these crews aren’t trust worthy this ‘MTV family’ is a disgusting gang of power tripping failed producers & executives who have failed.”  In early November, Abraham claimed she had been fired by Viacom for working as an adult entertainer. She later backtracked, clarifying that Viacom’s legal team had not terminated her contract."

"As Kylie Jenner’s feud with Wendy Williams rages on, Travis Scott is helping Kylie in the best way! Here’s how he’s supporting her amidst Wendy’s continuous disses!  Kylie Jenner, 20, is basking in the joy of being a new mother, but when she hears about Wendy Williams, 53, and her constant verbal attacks on her relationship with Travis Scott, 25, it’s hard not to get a bit frustrated. Wendy has stood by her prediction that Travis will eventually leave Kylie and the baby to live the partying lifestyle of a successful rapper. Before baby Stormi Webster was born on February 1, Wendy predicted that Travis would leave Kylie to raise the baby on her own. However, Travis hasn’t done that, and he doesn’t plan to, a source tells HollywoodLife.com. He’s sticking by Kylie’s side, and proving Wendy wrong.  “Kylie is getting the last laugh in her feud with Wendy Williams thanks to Travis,” the insider says. “Kylie’s not being petty and dwelling on it but yes, she’s pretty thrilled that Travis is proving Wendy and all the haters wrong. Don’t forget, Wendy said some pretty nasty things about how Travis was going to abandon Kylie and Stormi and that has not been the case at all.” Instead, it’s been the compete opposite. “He’s been so solid,” the source continues, adding that Travis is “the best dad and Kylie could not be happier. — She’s falling more in love with him every day.”  Throughout Kylie’s pregnancy, Wendy taunted the young star on her show. She remained adamant about her opinion that Kylie would be a single mother, even before giving birth. “At 20-years-old being pregnant, and I don’t care how much money you have, it’s got to be hard,” the talk show host said on her January 24 show. “The next reality show in the works right now might be, I got a name for you, ‘Kylie Goes It Alone’ because Travis Scott is not sticking around,” she proclaimed while laughing at a photo of the rapper. “Anyway, he’s not sticking around,” she said, once again.  Nonetheless, the couple is still going strong. In fact, Kylie and Travis celebrated Stormi’s one-month birthday on March 1, with both parents gushing over their bundle of joy on social media. First, Kylie took to Snapchat to show off the massive bouquets of pink flowers Travis had sent her in honor of Stormi’s one month in their lives. Then, both parents showed off photos of Stormi — the most we’ve seen of the little one — despite hiding her face in the snaps. Kylie also showed off her 4-week post-baby boy, aka her flat abs, on Snapchat.  Kylie and Travis welcomed a healthy baby girl, Stormi — who was 8 pounds, 9 ounces — at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on February 1. Kylie didn’t reveal she was pregnant or that she gave birth until February 4 when she released an 11-minute video with never-before-seen footage from her entire pregnancy. Since then, she’s returned to her normal social media use after taking a 9-month hiatus from the spotlight to enjoy her pregnancy in private. The news of Kylie’s pregnancy broke in September 2017."

"(JTA) — Most artists would see playing one concert at New York’s Madison Square Garden as a crowning achievement. Billy Joel has now done it 100 times.  Before and after his landmark show last week at the “World’s Most Famous Arena,” the native Long Islander gave a series of interviews about his legacy. In one with CBS News, he was asked about the most memorable moments during his incredible — and likely all-time record-breaking — MSG run.  After mentioning the nights that involved his daughter Della onstage, Joel brought up the concert during which he wore a yellow Star of David. Joel pinned the star to his jacket during the encore of a Garden show last August, shortly after white supremacists and neo-Nazis led a deadly march in Charlottesville, Virginia.  “This past year or so, there was the night I wore the Star of David, after the Charlottesville incident,” he said.  Although Joel is usually described as atheist or secular, his father was a German-born Jew who recalled the rise of Hitler and lost relatives in the Holocaust. CBS interviewer Anthony Mason pointed out that Joel usually avoids taking political stands.  On the weekend of the rally, President Donald Trump said “both sides” were to blame for the violence that occurred — and that were some “very fine people” among the far-right marchers as well as their opponents. That struck a dark chord with the songwriter.  “I had to do something that night,” Joel responded. “The president said [after the Charlottesville rally], you know, ‘There’s some good people on that side …’ No, Nazis aren’t good people.  “It really enraged me, actually,” he continued. “My old man, his family got wiped out. They were slaughtered in Auschwitz. Him and his parents were able to get out. But then he was in the U.S. Army during the war and fought with Patton and was shot at by Nazis. … My family suffered. And I think I actually have a right to do that.”  While many found the act courageous, it prompted some criticism.  But the singer also started a trend. Soon after, TV star Nev Schulman and musician and producer Jack Antonoff (both outwardly Jewish) both wore Jewish stars at the MTV Video Music Awards — Schulman wore one pinned to his suit jacket, and Antonoff wore one in necklace form. Lena Dunham, Antonoff’s girlfriend at the time, said he ordered the necklace after feeling like Nazis had become a “mainstream thing again.”  RELATED:  Billy Joel wore a yellow Jewish star. Thanks, but the trend should stop there."

"Brown, however, tried and failed to get Tran’s case against him dismissed, and his attorney was admonished for not addressing LaCour’s petition. Here’s what went down: Tran’s lawyers notified the court seven days in advance that she would be unable to attend the hearing in person due to work obligations, and instead planned to participate via phone. Gossip Cop has learned that at the hearing, Brown’s camp tried arguing for a dismissal, on the grounds that Tran should have given 12 days’ notice, not seven.  As Gossip Cop reported, Tran obtained a temporary restraining order against Brown in late February, accusing him of harassing her, assaulting her, and threatening to kill her. The model-actress’ best friend LaCour was also awarded a temporary restraining order after making similar allegations. Both are now seeking to get permanent stay-away orders against the singer.  Initially, the judge the was inclined to agree. But Brown’s legal team apparently failed to recognize this was a joint hearing with LaCour, who was in the court room ready to testify. “What they didn’t take into consideration was the other case,” one person who was at the hearing tells Gossip Cop exclusively. We’re told Brown’s attorneys “came swooping into court” expecting to get off easy on the technicality with Trans’ absence, but the judge pointed out that Brown “didn’t show up either,” despite another petitioner “ready to go.”  Gossip Cop hears Brown’s attorney tried to argue he had not been served in the cases, but evidence was presented to show he was properly served the restraining orders for both Tran and LaCour. Upon seeing that, “his lawyers began to struggle because they had no clue” about the second case, we’re told, and were not prepared to argue it. Furthermore, the judge accused his side of making a “mockery” of the court. He granted their request for a continuance but demanded Brown appear at the next hearing, which is slated for June 15.  And in an indication of how seriously the judge is taking these matters, the next hearing will be an evidentiary one, in which both sides must present evidence regarding the allegations. It’s also worth noting that Brown’s lead attorney, Mark Geragos, wasn’t even the one who represented him on Tuesday. Rather, a female lawyer was sent in his place. Last month, Tran’s manager slammed Geragos for accusing her of making up the domestic violence allegations for self-promotion. Gossip Cop will continue to have updates."

"Gal Gadot joined Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show” Tuesday night and showed off her lying prowess.  Insert lasso of truth joke here (we know you were thinking it). Even Gadot made it.  The “Wonder Woman” star played “Box of Lies” — a “Tonight Show” game where Fallon and a guest attempted to stump each other on the contents of a mystery box. Most of the items, however, are hard to describe even truthfully.  Also Read: 'Wonder Woman' First Reactions: 'the Best DCEU Film to Date'  Gadot won the game, but granted, some of the items made trying to confuse Fallon really easy. One item was a fake foot dressed up like a skiing mountain, complete with little skiiers. It’s an item so bizarre that not even Gadot had any idea what to do.  “I don’t even know how to describe this,” she laughed.  She eventually won the game (thanks to the aforementioned foot) and received the best prize as writer Seth Herzog came out and did an interpretive dance to the “Wonder Woman” theme song — complete with Wonder Woman regalia.

"Applicants during ABC's ""The Bachelor"" casting call at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic)  For a show that feeds on exposing private affairs and personal heartbreak, the application process for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" doesn't begin to scratch the surface.  Phoenix, along with 15 other cities, was chosen as a casting call site for season 23 of the hit reality-TV dating show. I volunteered to brave the high heels and nervous laughs to see what deep, personal secrets the show would be fishing for.  As a full disclaimer: I’m a fan of the show. I closely watched the last season, which featured Scottsdale ""Bachelor"" Arie Luyendyk Jr.  Not only is he probably the most-hated man in franchise history, but he gave a dismal showing of his hometown on America’s TV screens every Monday night. Scottsdale turned into a place to go bowling and reminisce on the old days.  Nevermind that Luyendyk actually grew up in Paradise Valley.  While that season was a bit of a letdown, I didn’t let it shift my belief in the process. The show, now with more spinoffs to keep track of, has captivated audiences season after season, following young hopefuls searching for love.  Was I looking for love? Absolutely not. Not quite like this, at least. But I had to believe there were some women auditioning in the hopes of finding their forever life partner on a reality show.  What's in an application  Arizona Republic reporter Rebecca Smouse poses for a photograph prior to auditioning for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Elizabeth Montgomery/The Republic)  I quickly befriended a young woman in the parking lot of The Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch. We both had recently graduated from Arizona State University and decided to stick together through this journey.  Following the trail of nicely dressed women, we wandered into a large ballroom to find what seemed like organized chaos. We were handed an application, a clipboard and a number.  I was No. 72.  A woman at the applications table said she expected about 200 people to filter through the resort by the end of the day. Phoenix has been a frequent destination for the show's casting calls, though few women from the Valley have been in recent seasons.  Everything felt like a test. Candy placed on the application table? Avoid that.  The ballroom, equipped with a DJ and an open bar, was decorated with women of all ages. Many were dressed to the nines, wearing beautiful dresses, tight fabrics and high heels. My parking-lot friend fit that description, dressed in a tube top and matching skirt with heels much taller than I could ever walk in.  I was wearing a matching top-and-bottom set with bright boots and some accent jewelry. I wore an outfit that I felt matched my personality without trying too hard.  Others arrived more simply in jeans and T-shirts. A young woman was dressed in a cow costume, clad with sparkly silver shoes, a bold move the producers would either applaud or completely dismiss.  Angelie Meehan, of Phoenix, wears a cow costume to her audition for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. She said she was looking for ""that special bull for her life."" (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic)  I was half expecting someone to start handing out champagne and offer lines of encouragement, something like, ""Are you ready for your journey to begin?""  We took our seats and began filling out a six-page-long application that delved into my dating history, employment and why I was looking for love on a reality TV show.  The application offered some interesting questions, such as:  What accomplishments are you most proud of?  Are you genuinely looking to get married and why?  What have you not found yet but would like in a relationship?  There were also several questions on prior relationships and marriages. The application explicitly asked if we drank alcohol, only to follow up with the next logical question: What's your favorite drink?  My newfound friend had issues with some of the questions, like what our salary was and what was on our bucket list. We both skipped the question asking if we had any interesting talents.  The application was coupled with an intense release to agree to everything the producers may do if you get picked for the show. It felt like we were signing our life away, a thought that resonated with many of the applicants sitting around us.  All in the name of love, though.  Interestingly enough, most people I spoke with who were auditioning had not watched the show before. It seemed strange to me to audition for a process they had never seen on TV before. This would be like someone trying out for ""Survivor"" not knowing you will be trapped on a deserted island.  To make it on the show, you must be 21 or older, be single and can't have been convicted of a felony. You also can't be running for any type of political office.  A quiet room, a video recording  Women line up to fill out their audition sheets during a casting call for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic)  After quite a bit of sitting and waiting, we stood in another line, had a few photos snapped and then were shuffled from the grand ballroom into smaller conference rooms, greeted by a small camcorder and an interviewer.  We sat as a small group outside, waiting for our names to be called. I made a new friend, who told me she reluctantly agreed to audition after a friend worried about her love life drove her to the resort. She said her friend even tweeted photos to the producers of the show to get their attention.  The empty room was daunting, but the woman behind the camera was kind. She'd been through her fair share of casting calls before and seemed to know all the right questions to ask to make me feel comfortable about divulging my personal life to a lens.  ""You were great!"" she said. Click.  I wondered if she said that to everyone or if she really meant it.  The questions were as basic as the rest of the process: talk about your family, where you grew up and your dating history. The video was the most personal part of the process, though it only lasted for about five minutes. The tapes get whisked off to Los Angeles to be viewed by show producers for the next month and a half.  I'm not holding my breath.  While I truly had no intentions of getting picked for the show, I did complete the application process honestly.  Most interestingly, almost none of the crew worked for ABC or ""The Bachelor"" directly. A few producers were roaming around, someone told me, but most were kept hidden behind closed doors. There was some secrecy to the whole process, as some girls were taken aside for private interviews and on special photo shoots.  Will any of them make it on the next season?  Stay tuned.

"“The final straw I had with Josh Martinez was [during] the HOH that I won,” explained Jessica Graf to “Big Brother” host Julie Chen moments after she was evicted on Thursday’s live episode. “He stood on the sidelines and attacked me the entire time. Right before that HOH competition, he had known that that was the anniversary of my dad’s passing, so it was a very emotional day for me. And instead of being a kind and caring human being — because this is just a game — he decided to kick me while I was down.”  “I think that that’s disgusting and I don’t stand by it,” Jessica declared in no uncertain terms about Josh’s controversial bullying. “And I just don’t like him as a person after that.” Jessica was evicted with a vote of 7 to 1, with her live-in boyfriend Cody Nickson being the only person to cast a vote for Raven Walton; Elena Davies received zero votes to evict. Read our Episode 21 recap here.  Does Jessica acknowledge that she threw away her chance at the $500,000 prize for a relationship with Cody? “It wasn’t that I gave up my game for Cody. We just thought alike. And because we thought so much alike, he was my partner in this game.” Jessica then admitted, “Of course I do,” when Julie asked if she loved Cody.  Still emotional, Jessica confessed, “It took half the season of just being attacked, lied to and back-stabbed for me to just give up. I put a lot of heart into certain relationships and friendships that I had with people in that house, and they lied to me several times and stabbed me in the back and let me down every chance that they had. So I just gave up.”  Also in her “Big Brother” exit interview Jessica learned that Josh’s real target was Elena, but that he only started campaigning against Jessica after the verbal attacks during the impromptu spelling bee. “I am so happy I don’t have to hear [Josh’s] voice anymore,” she responded. “Oh my God! He didn’t give me any reason to believe that I wasn’t the target, so I guess that was my fault.”  Be sure to make your predictions so that the contestants can see how they’re faring in our racetrack odds.

"Gwen Stefani’s Las Vegas residency began late last month, but it looks like her Just A Girl show is a bomb. Stefani is performing at the Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood – which has 4,600 seats – but her concerts aren’t even close to selling out. For her next show later this week, there are still 1,200 seats (26 percent) available.  “She can’t sell tickets,” says an insider. “There are literally thousands of seats still available this month!”  Radar Online is reporting that the remaining four July dates all have at least 1100 empty seats, and this failure has “devastated” Stefani.  Thank u for coming to Vegas gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Jul 14, 2018 at 1:52pm PDT  The next round of shows will be from December 27th to the 31st, but sales aren’t any better. According to Ticketmaster, there are over 1,300 seats available for the December 30th concert, which is her worst night of sales.  Since there are still so many seats available for multiple shows, discount sites like GoodSeatTickets.com have slashed prices up to 75 percent.  The show runs through Mid-March of next year, but if it turns out to be a bust, sources say she can always go back to The Voice.  “She always has The Voice. Gwen knows that she is welcomed back to the show anytime she wants,” says the source. “She is already in talks to rejoin the show after next season.”  But no matter if the show is a success or a failure, Stefani’s boyfriend Blake Shelton continues to support her. He even recently joked on Twitter earlier this week about his perfect attendance record to Stefani’s shows.  He wrote that Stefani had performed three Las Vegas shows so far, and he has been to all three. Then he added the hashtag #stalker.  The 48-year-old Hollaback Girl singer seems to be okay with her boyfriend’s stalker behavior, and just last week she shared photos of the two sharing a kiss on the lips.  Shelton walked the red carpet with Stefani on the opening night of her show on June 27th, and the crowd that night gave him a standing ovation when he walked into the theater.  Stefani’s Just A Girl show features the biggest hits from her solo career as well as her time with No Doubt, and, she also included her romance with Shelton. While singing Make Me Like You – a song she says is about Shelton – she wears a cowgirl outfit.

"Chanel Iman and Sterling Shepard are officially married. The 27-year-old Victoria's Secret model and 25-year-old New York Giants wide receiver tied the knot this weekend in a ceremony at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles, according to People.  The couple, who met in November 2016 at Victor Cruz's birthday party, got engaged in December and announced the happy news today on Instagram.  ""A night full of tears of happiness I’m beyond excited to spend the rest of my life with you @sterl_shep3 you are my soulmate, my best friend, my everything!

The couple's A-list guest list reportedly included Chrissy Teigen, Gabrielle Union, Odell Beckham Jr., Shanina Shaik, Joan Smalls and bridesmaid/fellow model Jourdan Dunn.  Chanel wore a stunning Zuhair Murad wedding gown with a cape on her big day, which celebrity stylist Anita Patrickson helped her secure.  ""I never really envisioned wearing something like that for my wedding,"" Iman told Brides.com. ""But the moment we put it on, we all loved it! It was so chic and unusual but also felt a little vintage.""  The model changed dresses for the reception, donning a second Zuhair Murad gown, this one with a deep V-neck and pink tones to match the wedding's rose gold theme.  ""I wanted to keep it as classic as possible,"" she said. ""I wanted a design that I can look back on in 20 years and not be wondering what I was thinking!""  Iman and Shepard worked with wedding planner Mindy Weiss, one of BAZAAR's top planners, for their Los Angeles affair. Weiss tapped florist Mark's Garden to create the blush-toned floral walls and arches for the couple's ceremony, and to design the rose gold world the bride imagined for her ceremony. Photographers Amy & Stuart captured the couple's entire day–including the bride's multiple fashion moments."

But two months later the rumour mill is churning again amid reports the two stars got cosy during a VIP party at the Glastonbury music festival over the weekend  According to the paper the stars were seen holding hands and stroking each other as they partied with mutual pals including Bradley Cooper and Noel Gallagher in the early hours of Saturday.

The 35-year-old Brit insisted she would not 'dignify it with a response', in an interview with the New York Post just days after Page Six claimed the duo enjoyed a dinner date in Los Angeles.  Bachelor life: Brad has been enjoying single life as he attended Glastonbury with pals including Bradley Cooper  Music fan: Brad was seen checking out the weekend's acts side of stage on Friday  Having previously dated her Alfie co-star Jude Law and and enjoyed a 'brief' encounter with Layer Cake's Daniel Craig, she conceded that the Brad reports were 'predictable', as his production company is behind her new movie The Lost City of Z.  Page Six reported that Sienna and Brad were reportedly seen getting flirty in LA, after which they attended the premiere of The Lost City Z separately but insiders claim at a dinner after the screening the pair got close.  Brad, whose company Plan B is behind the film, was said to be doing some 'serious flirting' while surrounded by about 25 people. A source told Page Six: 'They were heavily enjoying each other's company and 'they were talking to each other all night.'  Rendezvous: The report claims Sienna met up with Brad at 3am in the festival's Rabbit Hole area where onlookers spied them looking very cosy  It was claimed that soon to be divorced Brad seemed to perk up after the interaction with Sienna as he was 'in very high spirits, which he hasn't been for a long time. He seems to be over a hump'.  Shortly after the reports emerged, Sienna spoke to The New York Post, where she vehemently denied the reports - insisting she would not entertain the prospect. She said: 'I'm not going to even dignify it with a response. It's predictable and silly'.  Prior to her denial, another source close to Sienna downplayed the possible flirtation and said the pair were part of a larger group so there were a lot of conversations going on throughout the night.  Party people; Sienna, a new recruit to Instagram, shared a snap of her swish ride to the festival on Friday with her pals  Back when the movie was filming, Sienna was forced to deny that there was another going on with a then-very married Brad.  She called a suggestion they were flirting 'insane' on Sway In The Morning on SiriusXM's Shade 45. The star said: 'The brilliant thing about that rumor is that yeah I haven't really read too much about it.  'So this is the truth about that, Brad Pitt is producing the movie that I just wrapped but I didn't see him, he's not been to the set. You know he's the producer of the film and I've met him twice - it's insane.'  Meanwhile according to New Idea, Elle Macpherson has also been spotted cosying up to actor Brad during a recent rendezvous in Hollywood.  Another rumour: Meanwhile according to New Idea, Elle Macpherson has also been spotted cosying up to actor Brad during a recent rendezvous in Hollywood  'They definitely seemed cosy together, like a couple on an intimate date,' the publication's source claimed on Monday.  'She was touching his arm a lot and flicking her hair over her shoulder,' the onlooker said of the 53-year-old supermodel, adding: 'There was a lot of flirting going on.'  It appears Brad, 53, also enjoyed the Australian bombshell's company during their meeting at the LA nightclub.  'He was laughing at everything she said and leaning in really close,' the source claimed.  The pair first met on the set of Friends in 1999, while Brad was still married to Jennifer Aniston, who also starred on the sitcom.  Reports of the genetically-blessed pair's meet-up comes just weeks after Elle supposedly split from billionaire property developer Jeffrey Soffer.  The mother-of-two and her sons Flynn, 19, and Aurelius, 14, are said to have moved out of the Miami mansion they previously shared with the 44-year-old billionaire."

She’s such a lovely person I’ve got nothing but love for her.”  The British-born stand-up, who looked trendy in a printed blouse, went on to give his take about her latest job as judge on American Idol.  6 The comedian, 42, praised his popstar ex after he famously dumped her by text in 2011  AFP 6 The showbiz pair were married for less than two years  He continued: ""I don't know much about American Idol or things like that.  ""I certainly think that she's probably a very good judge, so I certainly wouldn't comment on how much she's earning in the negative. I wish her all the best in all of her endeavours.""

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's first royal tour together is significant for so many reasons. Having announced that they're expecting their first child together, due in the Spring of 2019, the newlyweds have been greeted by royal fans in Australia this week. And the warm welcome is sure to continue as they travel to New Zealand, Fiji, and the Kingdom of Tonga in the coming days.  As they're now expecting a baby, it's exciting to see the Duke and Duchess of Sussex attending so many events together, and displaying such an impressive royal tour wardrobe along the way.  But what makes Meghan and Harry's appearance at the Invictus Games 2018 so significant is the fact that they first made their public debut as a couple at last year's event. And it's hard to believe just how much has happened in the last year.  On September 23, 2017, Meghan was spotted in the crowd at the Invictus Games in Toronto, the city in which she lived while filming Suits. She was there to support Prince Harry, who is heavily involved in the sporting event, which aims to support veterans and service people who have sustained injuries and disabilities while serving their countries:  Getty Images AFP Contributor  The separation didn't last long, though, as on September 25, 2017, Meghan and Harry attended a wheelchair tennis match in Toronto as part of the Invictus Games. Not only did they sit next to one another, but they also held hands, and looked very much in love throughout the event:  Getty Images Danny Lawson - PA Images  After that first public appearance, their relationship progressed fairly quickly, with the pair announcing their engagement on November 27, 2017:  Now, attending the Invictus Games 2018, Harry and Meghan look more unified than ever. Traveling to Sydney for the event, rather than Meghan's former home of Toronto, the Duke and Duchess have truly become a unit. Not only are they married, and starting a family, but they're jointly supporting the causes and organizations that are important to them both.  Having gotten married in May 2018, and announced Meghan's pregnancy at the start of the royal tour, it's clear that the Duke and Duchess aren't wasting time when it comes to their love story."

"Karla Souza has spoken out about a sustained campaign of sexual harassment and assault she allegedly sustained at the hands of a director.  Souza, 32, told CNN en Español Tuesday that she was raped by a director early in her career.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Speaking to Carmen Aristegui, Souza, who now stars as Laurel Castillo in ABC’s How to Get Away with Murder, said she was assaulted by the director while filming on location in her native Mexico. She declined to name the director.  The actress said she had been separated from fellow castmates as she was staying at a separate hotel where only she and the director had rooms. She claims he then started to drop by at odd hours.  “He knocked at my door saying he wanted to go over some scenes and I thought it’s 2 a.m., it’s not appropriate and it’s something that shouldn’t be happening,” she said.  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  Souza claimed the director knocked on her door again, but when she refused to open it, he “decided not to shoot my scene and then he suddenly started to humiliate me in front of the others on the set.”  “This was the psychological control that he held over me,” she added.  Souza said that after a month of bearing the brunt of the director’s “total abuse of power” she felt she had no choice but to “give in”.  “I ended up giving in to him. [I let him] kiss me, to touch me in ways I did not want him to touch me and in one of those instances, he attacked me violently and yes, he raped me,” she said, wiping away tears.

"Newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have had quite the day. May 19's royal wedding has easily been one of the year's biggest events, not to mention a huge moment in the history of bridal fashion and beauty. Now, nearly 12 hours into the day, the couple can finally put their feet up. Just kidding; they're off to a royal evening reception at Frogmore House, a location that's undoubtedly less awesome than its name, where they'll celebrate with family, friends, and fellow royals. For this, Markle changed into a reception dress that's just as divine as her ceremony gown.  The freshly married couple exited Windsor Castle, each having switched to a brand-new look. Both Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, looked less formal than in the chapel earlier, but still just as classic and sophisticated. Markle's reception dress, a long white gown made of silk crepe by British designer Stella McCartney, featured a halter-style neckline and the same type of effortless elegance as every other element of the bride's wedding-day look.  Steve Parsons/WPA Pool/Getty Images  Harry, on the other hand, changed out of his official frockcoat uniform and into a classic black tuxedo, complete with a black bowtie around his neck and an adorable just-married grin across his face.  Steve Parsons/WPA Pool/Getty Images  In case you need a reminder of the striking Givenchy design Markle wore earlier in the day, here it is in all its royal-wedding glory:  Getty Images  Anyway, here's hoping the newlywed couple has a happy reception party at Frogmore House, the name of which I cannot stop saying in my head.

"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been pretty clear about their desire to start a family eventually. But a new report from Us Weekly has it that the timeline for baby #1 has become accelerated after the royal wedding. Multiple sources have told the outlet that after the ceremony, the two's desire for having kids grew. “Having children is definitely a priority,” a source close to Markle told Us. “She and Harry want to start a family right away—and she’ll start trying as soon as she can.”  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  A second source that the outlet describes as a royal insider echoed this, though was a little less ""this'll happen ASAP."" “They both can’t wait to start a family. [Still,] Harry and Meghan won’t rush into anything. They have a lot on their plate right now. But they both think that when the moment feels right, that will be the time to go for it. They’ll make fantastic parents.”  A third source chimed in that even Markle's mom Doria Ragland believes that baby will come soon. “Doria is expecting to be a grandmother by this time next year. She’s very excited for Meghan to become a mother.”  Harry and Markle are currently believed to be on their honeymoon, though they are expected to attend the Queen's Trooping of the Colour official birthday parade this Saturday. They have a trip planned to Australia this fall for the Sydney Invictus Games and are said to have a busy second half of the year coming with work engagements. Whether a pregnancy announcement will come before or after all that, we'll see.  In their first interview together after announcing their engagement, Markle and Harry made it clear they hope to have children someday. When asked about their plans to start a family, Harry said, ""No [not now], of course, you know, one step at a time. Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future.""  At an event in March, Markle hinted that future is nearer rather than farther. The two met a wife-husband entrepreneur duo Sinead and Adam Murphy, who showed the couple products from their Shnuggle line, which include a baby bath and Moses basket. Markle quipped to them, ""I’m sure at some point we’ll need the whole thing.”"
"The only budget Ted Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Marco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press.""He talks tough on some of these issues,"" Rubio said Dec. 13. ""For example, he was going to ‘carpet bomb’ ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Rubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians , who typically favor less defense spending.We decided to fact-check Rubio’s claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president.Cruz’s vote on Rand Paul’s budget proposalRubio’s campaign pointed to Cruz’s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul’s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.Paul’s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.Rubio’s campaign pointed to Paul’s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:""This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,"" Paul wrote. ""It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.""Under Paul’s proposal , defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.Was Paul’s proposal a ‘cut’ for defense?So why did Rubio refer to Paul’s budget as a ""cut"" if defense spending would rise?""We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,"" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.But experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul’s proposal a ""cut.""""Paul’s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president’s budget was an even larger increase),"" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But Paul’s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.""Paul’s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama’s request both at the time and now, Harrison said.Christopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul’s budget a ""cut.""""As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,"" he said. ""This is misleading.""Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.""So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a ‘cut’ when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,"" Phillips said. ""The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.""Benjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz’s vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul’s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.""This was a budget, so it doesn’t make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,"" Friedman said.Our rulingRubio said that the only budget Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Rubio was referring to Cruz’s vote in favor of Paul’s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul’s plan when he called it a ""cut."" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth.However, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul’s proposal for defense was below Obama’s request.We rate this statement Mostly False."

"Together at last! Javi Marroquin and Briana DeJesus made things official during Monday, June 4, episode of Teen Mom 2. Even though they tried to act like one big happy family with their children, their relationship with Kailyn Lowry couldn’t be worse. Also, Chelsea Houska faced Adam Lind in court and can finally sleep soundly again. Find out what you might have missed during this week’s episode of Teen Mom 2.  Chelsea Finally Feels Her Daughter is Safe  It was finally time for Chelsea to face her ex in court to try to hyphenate her daughter’s last name to match her and her husband Cole Deboer’s name. She also wanted to get her visitation agreement changed so that Adam could only see Aubree in a visitation center. She couldn’t be more nervous to faceher ex, who she hadn’t seen in about a year.  “I hate that I doubt myself,” Chelsea said and continued to worry about her intentions. “Am I being ridiculous? Can you be too ridiculous when it comes to your child?”  In the end, everything went Chelsea’s way, and she cried on the car ride home because she finally felt like Aubree was in a safe situation.  “I just feel like a weight is lifted off my shoulders,” Chelsea said. They celebrated by telling Aubree about the name change by writing it on a cake, and Aubree was over-the-moon.  Briana and Javi are Official  After weeks of beating around the bush, Briana finally admitted that she and Javi were “boyfriend and girlfriend.” She went to Delaware to celebrate Lincoln’s birthday with the kids. She even made Javi and their children matching shirts for the party.  “I’m looking forward to today,” Javi said, and the two were acting like they were married already even though they just made it official. Javi was stressed about the Kailyn situation, but was mushy about having Briana to help him through it. “It’s nice having you by my side,” he told her.  Even though last week’s episode made it seem like Kailyn was in a relationship with her friend Dom, she shut rumors down this week by declaring she was too busy dealing with other people to be in a relationship. Although she was mostly referring to her children, the Briana/Javi drama might also have had something to do with it.  When Javi decided Briana was going to go to Lincoln’s party that he was supposed to cohost with Kailyn, Kailyn dropped out and had her own party. Briana exchanged some vicious texts with Javi’s ex, and it caught Kailyn off guard.  “Shut the f—k up cause now I’m mad. S—k my d—k, you dumb bitch,” Briana texted Kailyn when Kailyn said she didn’t want to meet up with her to talk thing about.  After that explosion, Kailyn prohibited the crew from filming any part of the party because Briana was there. “I don’t think that she’s a good person,” Kailyn said. “I don’t want anything to do with him.”  Nathan Might Still Be In Love With Jenelle  Jenelle Evans embarked on a new business venture and transformed her personal Facebook into a more professional page. However, the change made rumors swirl that she and David Eason were breaking up because her page no longer mentioned they were together. Her ex Nathan Griffith didn’t waste any time to text Jenelle to find out what was going on and tell her he wants the best for her.  “You don’t know s—t about Kaiser. You don’t ask about Kaiser. But you ask if I’m broken up with David,” Jenelle told her friend about the text, who proclaimed that Nathan was just trying to weasel his way back into her life. To no one’s surprise, David lost it when he found out about the text. He got into a fight with Nathan over it and called him some extremely derogatory words. When Jenelle was suppose to drop off Kaiser to Nathan after, she sent David’s mother to avoid drama.  However, Nathan was so made about the texts, he went after David’s mom. He also seemed a little upset that the two were still together. “They need to get off the drugs,” Nathan said. “I won’t do this no more.”  Leah Opens Up To Her Daughter  Leah Messer took her daughter Aleeah Grace to a therapist this episode to work out some behavioral issues she was dealing with. Aleeah was acting out, and Leah and her ex Corey Simms thought it had something to do with her twin getting more attention than her. The appointment went well, but Leah had to talk about her daughter’s problems in front of her, which made it awkward.  “It was hard to talk about why you’re not always the nicest to Ali,” Leah told Aleeah afterward. “Even when you have a bad day, I still love you.”  Teen Mom 2 airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

The beauty's new love comes after her relationship with Telsa mogul Elon Musk and marriage to Johnny Depp.  In May of 2016, Amber filed for divorce from Depp, and within a week won a restraining order against him, claiming he had verbally and physically abused her.  Delicious! While the beauty was on the phone, Vito couldn't help but dig into the Triscuit crackers they'd picked up  Former love: Amber's last beau was Telsa mogul Elon Musk (pictured: Vito)  Through a representative, Johnny dismissed abuse accusations as 'salacious false stories, gossip, misinformation and lies about his personal life.'  By that August, he and Amber reached an agreement whereby she would scrap the restraining order and get a $7 million divorce settlement, which she said she would give to charity.  Johnny decided to give the money directly to the groups of her choice, Children's Hospital and the American Civil Liberties Union, according to TMZ.  It was not lost on Amber's team that this meant he'd get the tax deduction, and they told TMZ Johnny ought to correct for this by doubling the $7 million to $14 million."
"He is a prince raised in London, the son of the first heir to the British throne.  She is an actress born in California, the daughter of a yoga instructor and a former television lighting director.  But despite their different upbringings, Prince Harry and his American girlfriend Meghan Markle have more in common than we previously believed.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  A genealogical investigation by The Mail on Sunday has found that the famous pair are actually distant cousins, related through a late 15th Century ancestor of the Queen Mother.  Getty Images  The publication reports the Suits star's connection to the Royal Family comes as a result of her family's ancestry dating all the bay back to High Sheriff of County Durham Ralph Bowes - an ancestor of Markle from 15 generations ago.  Bowes' family seat was Streatlam Castle situated in the North East of England and his grandson Christopher Hussey moved to America in 1632, helping to found Nantucket, Massachusetts. Fast forward a few years and boom, Meghan Markle.  Meanwhile, Bowes's great-grandson Sir George Bowes became a member of parliament during the reign of Charles II and to cut a very long story short, Prince Harry came along.  What's more bizarre is the fact that Prince Harry's ancestor, Henry VIII, reportedly executed a relative of Markle.  A new report, via The Sunday Telegraph, claims that back when Henry VIII was reigning in Britain, there was a plot orchestrated by a man named Lord Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford and the great-great-great grandfather to Christopher Hussey (see above), to attempt to overthrow the monarch. As a result, Henry VIII had him beheaded.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Now, before everyone stars yelling 'incest' at Harry and Meghan's shared lineage, we'd like to point out that if you go far back enough to the Middle Ages, you're probably related to the man sitting next to you on the bus or your colleague sat opposite to you.  A genetic survey in 2013 found that all Europeans living today are related to the same set of ancestors who lived 1,000 years ago. And you don't have to go back much further in time to to find that everyone in the world is related to each other.  Who would've though it, ey?  The news comes days after Channel 4's aired a documentary looking into the Californian star's life, titled When Harry Met Meghan: A Royal Romance."
"During Kanye West’s 11-month absence from the site, Twitter could hardly have been described as boring. Even without the 40-year-old rapper’s daily musings, the Twitterverse remained as addictive and corrosive as ever, thanks in large part to it having become, under the 45th president, a flashpoint for international diplomacy, partisan combat and ruthless trollery. But this past weekend, seemingly out of nowhere, Yeezy returned to the site where he once admitted to getting “emotional over fonts”, declared The Life of Pablo “the album of the life” and wondered about the providence of a water bottle he discovered while on an airplane.  The rise and rise of Kanye West’s influence on fashion Read more  Having deleted all those old tweets, West started anew on Sunday with a remarkably on-brand, and predictably existentialist, message. “Some people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness,” he wrote, following it up with photos of forthcoming Yeezy footwear and the word “Saint”, West’s son’s name, in various typefaces.  KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and friends  Following a 24-hour break, he returned again on Tuesday with a string of aphorisms: “As a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency,” read one tweet. “Try to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas,” he wrote in another, which the MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes called “extremely good advice”. West went on to call distraction “the enemy of vision” and instructed his 7.6 million followers to “make decisions based on love not fear”.  All these tweets made more sense once West, in a Hollywood Reporter interview with his interior designer Axel Vervoordt, revealed plans to release a philosophy book called Break the Simulation.  “I’ve got this new concept that I’ve been diggin’ into,” he said, describing his Barthesian thesis about photography. “I’ve got a concept about photographs, and I’m on the fence about photographs – about human beings being obsessed with photographs – because it takes you out of the now and transports you into the past or transports you into the future.” Time, West added, “is our most valuable resource”.  To his longtime fans, the preoccupation with lofty ideas like time, capitalism and consciousness are just about the least surprising thing about the 21-time Grammy winner’s return to Twitter. He’s always been hip-hop’s pre-eminent and most brazen sage. What may come as a surprise, though, is the fact that West’s latest tweets are the book, as he revealed on Wednesday morning. “Oh by the way this is my book that I’m writing in real time,” West wrote. “No publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write.”  KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.  Of course, a tweet-stream-of-consciousness book is not the only thing on West’s plate. The rapper-cum-designer is also reportedly working on his eighth studio album, his first since 2016’s The Life of Pablo, which was dropped during an elaborate listening session at New York’s Madison Square Garden. In a since-deleted tweet from 2016, West said his next album would be called “Turbo Grafx 16”, a title that’s presumably gone through a few iterations since, as West changed the name of his seventh album several times before settling on Pablo.  In March, E! News reported that West, along with several of his collaborators, was recording at a studio in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where “he is in the zone to get things done”. Rumored visitors of West’s, gleaned from Instagram posts and sightings in the Jackson area, reportedly included the Dream, Travis Scott, Kid Cudi and the Chicago rapper King Louie.  Nevertheless, exactly when West plans to release new music is unclear. He and his wife, Kim Kardashian, welcomed a third child, Chicago, in January, and he’s also hard at work on the latest collection for his clothing line, Yeezy. But if West’s insightful and reliably zany return to Twitter is any indication, he is not wanting for consciousness-shifting ideas."

"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘Found Each Other to Change the World,’ Nacho Figueras Says  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s romance is one for the ages, according to their pal Nacho Figueras. The Argentine polo star, who appeared alongside the couple at the 2018 Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup on Thursday, July 26, raved about the couple on Instagram and Twitter after the match, saying their love story serves a greater purpose.  “This girl really rocks. The more I know you, the more I am convinced that you both found each other to change the world,” he captioned a photo of himself presenting a trophy to the Duchess of Sussex. “Let’s push the envelope!! Let’s make the world a better place.”  Figueras, who is also a Ralph Lauren model, was on Harry’s team — the winning team — at Thursday’s match for Sentebale, an organization founded by the Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho. Sentebale aims to “become the leading organization in the provision of psychosocial support for children living with HIV in Southern Africa,” according to its website.  Thursday’s match raised more than £1 million for the charity. “@sentebale currently reaches nearly 4,000 young people a year with our unique programme of psychosocial support, so they can live long, happy, healthy lives,” Figueras captioned another photo. On a throwback pic of himself with Harry, he added that it was “an honor to be the captain of the @stregishotels Polo Team playing with this great man for a great cause.”  Figueras made headlines earlier this week when a photo of him with the royal couple went viral and sparked a series of memes. The image showed Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan celebrating his team’s victory with a kiss, as Figueras stood next to them awkwardly, trying to hand them the trophy.  Fortunately, the athlete had a good sense of humor about the situation and even joked about being the newlyweds’ third wheel in one of his posts. “When you wished the trophy would turn into a violin,” he quipped. “What an incredible love story.”  (photos via Chris Jackson/Getty Images)"

"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption McGraw's second album, Not a Moment Too Soon, sold more than six million copies in the US alone  Country star Tim McGraw collapsed on stage during a performance in Dublin on Sunday night.  The singer had just performed his hit single Humble and Kind when he sat down near his keyboard player, then slumped to his knees as he walked off stage.  McGraw's wife, singer Faith Hill, later came out to tell the audience he could not continue with the performance.  ""He's been super dehydrated,"" she said. ""I apologise, but I made the decision that he cannot come back out on stage.""  After the audience chanted ""We love Tim"", Hill sang an a capella rendition of What A Friend We Have in Jesus, before the lights came up and the audience was ushered out.  McGraw, 50, was approaching the end of his set when he was taken ill at around 22:45 on Sunday night.  Audience member Del Crookes told the BBC the star's collapse ""was a bit of a shock"".  ""I thought he was taking in the applause while sitting down after singing Humble and Kind,"" he said.  ""But when a spotlight was switched on him, he was slumped on his knees on the left hand side of the stage. The light was quickly turned off and you could see his crew helping him off - and the band ran over as well.  ""It was about another 20 minutes before Faith Hill came out to say the show was ending early.""  The gig, at Dublin's 3 Arena was the final date of a three-day, three-city tour of the UK and Ireland, as part of the Country to Country festival.  McGraw and Hill were co-headliners, and had played in London on Friday night, then in Glasgow on Saturday.  Hill said the whole crew had been left ""a little bit dehydrated"" from ""travelling so much"".  A spokesman for McGraw said the star ""was attended to by local medical staff on-site and will be fine"".  ""He and Faith thank everyone for their love and support and look forward to seeing their Irish fans again soon.""  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tim McGraw and Faith Hill married in 1996  Recently, McGraw made headlines as being one of the few mainstream country artists to voice support for gun control.  On 3 March, he praised the US sporting goods store Dick's, after it raised the minimum age for anyone buying guns or ammunition to 21 years.  ""Thank you @Dicks for taking a stand to promote a meaningful discussion for the safety of our kids!"" McGraw wrote on Twitter, tagging other major retailers including Walmart, Kroger and LL Bean.  Those outlets later followed Dick's lead.  Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
"CLICK HERE if you are having trouble viewing the photos or video on a mobile device  With Angelina Jolie finally moving on from her nasty, splashy split from Brad Pitt, you would expect her to shy away from dating someone else super-famous.  But you would think her next romantic interest would still be someone whose profession matched her preferences for prestige artistry or international do-gooding: a documentary filmmaker, a human rights crusader, an Ebola doctor.  But no, Jolie’s choice reportedly is far more home-grown and, well, mundane in a L.A. way.  Jolie, the Oscar winning actress, UNHCR special envoy and occasional New York Times op-ed columnist, is dating a real estate agent. That’s according to a new report in “Entertainment Tonight.”  Of course, at this stage, things are still pretty new, which means “it’s not serious,” a source told ET.  But the so-called real estate agent, who has not been identified, reportedly has a few things going for him that would make him appealing to the glamorous 42-year-old actress and mother of six, ET said.  He’s handsome, a source close to the actress told ET. He’s also “older-looking” and isn’t “a celebrity or high-profile” in any way, the source added. These are qualities that would probably make him relatively down-to-earth — by Jolie standards — and confer on him a maturity and stability that could be comforting to her.  After all, she was “in a very bad place” after her acrimonious split from Pitt in September 2016, “ET” reported. Their breakup included allegations of drinking and anger management problems — on his part — and led to investigations by child welfare authorities until the couple quietly worked out visitation and other issues. The estranged couple share children Maddox, 16, Zahara, 13, Pax, 14, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.  “Just having another adult to spend time with has been helpful,” the source added to ET.  But not so fast, sources have told both Us Weekly and People. Both outlets reported Tuesday, citing their own Jolie sources, that Jolie isn’t dating a real estate agent — or anyone for that matter at the moment.  “Yes, she has hung out with a couple of guys over the last year, but it’s extremely low-key,” a source told Us.  Unfortunately, things are still difficult between her and Pitt, added The Daily Mail. “Things between Brad and Angie really ended poorly, and while they’ve attempted therapy with the children, they can barely be in the same room together,” a source said.

Because the breakup has forced Jolie to curtail her globe-trotting ways and base herself in Los Angeles — close to Pitt for the sake of the children — there is speculation that if Jolie were seeing a real estate agent — or anyone else — the man would be based in Los Angeles, the Daily Mail said.  And if there is a real estate agent with whom she has become friendly, he could be someone with celebrity clientele.  Perhaps he could have been someone involved in settling Jolie into her new house — the $25 million estate in Los Feliz she bought last year, which once belonged to legendary director Cecil B. DeMille. Incidentally, Jolie’s mansion is “just down the street” from Pitt’s estate in Los Feliz — for the sake of the kids, of course.  Whether or not there is a real estate agent boyfriend in Jolie’s life, or she’s just single and focusing on her kids, her friends are relieved to see her happy for a change, ET reported.  She also seems to have settled into enjoying her day-to-day life. She is often spotted out and about in Los Angeles, usually with one of her six kids in tow, doing ordinary-people things like shopping at a neighborhood Whole Foods or going to the movies — including, reportedly, the new “Tomb Raider” reboot, starring Alicia Vikander in the iconic role that Jolie made famous in 2001’s “Lara Croft: Tomb Raider” and the 2003 sequel.  But fans should get over the idea that Jolie and Pitt will reunite. “It will never happen,” a source told ET. The 54-year-old Pitt is quietly and casually going out on dates, but mostly getting out to spend time with friends, “ET” added.  This story has been updated."

"Three more accusers have reportedly come forward accusing former House of Cards star Kevin Spacey of sexual assault.  London’s Metropolitan Police are investigating the actor after men separately reported him for separate attacks that respectively occurred Westminster in 1996, in Lambeth in 2008 and in Gloucester in 2013, according to TMZ.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The Met does not identify people who are subject to investigations until charges have been filed and would not confirm Spacey is being investigated. However, a spokesperson confirmed that officers from the Child Abuse and Sexual Offenses Command are investigating six separate, male-on-male alleged sexual assaults that match the three dates published by TMZ, as well as three dates previously connected to Spacey.  Kevin Spacey Frazer Harrison/BAFTA LA/Getty Images  Spacey’s attorney did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.  In October 2017, actor Anthony Rapp claimed Spacey had previously made inappropriate sexual advances toward him when he was just 14 years old.  In response, Spacey, now 58, issued a statement on Twitter addressing the allegations and coming out as gay.  “I have a lot of respect and admiration for Anthony Rapp as an actor. I’m beyond horrified to hear his story,” he said. “I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.”  Several more people accused the actor of sexual harassment or assault since, and in April, one sexual assault case against the star reported to have taken place in October of 1992 in West Hollywood involving a male adult was turned over to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office for further review.  In November, the actor entered a treatment facility. He has not been out in public since and has been written off the finale season of House of Cards.  On Tuesday, actor Guy Pearce hinted at an unpleasant experience while working with Spacey.  “Yeah… Tough one to talk about at the moment,” he said on Australian talk show host Andrew Denton’s Interview, according to Independent. “Amazing actor; incredible actor. Slightly difficult time with Kevin, yeah. He’s a handsy guy.”"

"For the fictional character on the soap opera The Young and the Restless, see Nikki Newman  Nicole Houston Reed (born May 17, 1988)[1] is an American actress, screenwriter, singer-songwriter, and model known for her portrayal of vampire Rosalie Hale in The Twilight Saga (2008–2012). She became known in 2003, after the release of the film Thirteen, directed by Catherine Hardwicke, for which she was credited with Hardwicke as a co-writer of the screenplay, and in which she played a lead role. The film earned Reed an Independent Spirit Award for Best Debut Performance, as well as several nominations.  Early life [ edit ]  Reed was born in West Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Cheryl Houston, a beautician, and Seth Reed, a production designer. She has an older brother, Nathan August Reed, and a younger half-brother Joey Reed.  Reed has said in numerous interviews that her early home life was ""complicated"". Her parents divorced when Reed was two, and she was raised by her mother.[2] Her mother is a Christian of Cherokee and Italian descent; her father is Jewish.[3] Reed was raised without religion[4] and has identified as Jewish.[5][6] She grew up around some Jewish practices, as her brother had a Bar Mitzvah.[7]  In 2002, when Reed was 14 years old, she moved out of her mother's house and began living on her own, mainly in apartments in the Los Angeles area.[8] After Thirteen's success, Reed returned to Alexander Hamilton High School in Los Angeles, but dropped out again after a year. She said that ""mothers who were sneaking into the school at lunchtime to confront and harass her about the film"" were the reason for her departure.[2] She earned a high school diploma through homeschooling.[2] She is a vegetarian.  Career [ edit ]  Catherine Hardwicke, a friend of her mother's,[9] invited her to work on a script with her, when Reed said she was interested in acting. They finished the script for the semi-autobiographical film Thirteen in six days. Producers asked Reed to play a role in the film because they had trouble casting it, as it was an ""uncomfortable"" role for most young actresses.[2]  Ondine at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival. Reed at the premiere ofat the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival.  The film, starring Evan Rachel Wood, was released in 2003 to positive reviews, gaining Reed some recognition in Hollywood as both a screenwriter and an actress. Following this, Reed was invited to appear on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and serve as host on a number of award shows, including the Young Hollywood Awards (2003) and the Independent Spirit Awards Nomination Show, followed by the West Independent Spirits Awards, both in 2004. Reed has repeatedly been cast as sexually advanced, precocious teenagers, including her character in Lords of Dogtown (2007), also directed by Hardwicke. In early 2006, she appeared on the series The O.C., playing Sadie, a new love interest for the character Ryan Atwood. Reed later appeared on The O.C. at the same time as future Twilight co-stars Cam Gigandet and Jackson Rathbone.[10]  Reed said that her early decision to avoid acting in television series or in mainstream cinema was naïve. She had thought at the time they were not right for her, but had since gained valuable experience in them.[11] She had a lead role in Mini's First Time, which received a limited release in the United States on July 14, 2006. Reed played a teenager who, through seduction, involves her stepfather in a plot to murder her mother. Reed has noted that her character does not ""understand the weight of consequence"". She said she had enjoyed playing someone who she describes as ""crass"" and having a ""trucker's mouth"".[12] Reed's character has sex scenes. As Reed was 16 at the time and legally unable to film such scenes in an explicit way, she was filmed from the back to hide her face.[2] On February 12, 2008, it was announced that Reed would portray Rosalie Hale in the film adaption of Twilight, the first book of a popular four-novel series. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke, it became an international success.  In 2010, Jason Mewes said that he was doing a movie called K-11 with Reed and Kristen Stewart, also of Twilight.[13] The film, directed by Stewart's mother, takes place in a dorm of the Los Angeles County Jail. It was to feature both Stewart and Reed as female characters.[14][15] Later that year, Reed said that she was no longer part of the project.[16]  In July 2010, Reed joined the cast of the lady assassin action-drama Catch .44, alongside Bruce Willis, Forest Whitaker and Malin Akerman.[17] In November 2010, it was announced that Reed would star with Hayden Panettiere in the film Downers Grove, a movie adaptation of Michael Hornburg's novel.[18] The screenplay was written by Bret Easton Ellis, the novelist who wrote The Rules of Attraction and American Psycho.[19]  In December 2011, it was announced that Reed joined the cast of Pawn, an indie crime thriller directed by David A. Armstrong. The film also stars Forest Whitaker, Ray Liotta, Common, Michael Chiklis, Sean Faris, Stephen Lang, Marton Csokas and Jessica Szohr.[20] In July 2013, Reed joined the cast of the independent sports comedy Balls Out, alongside Jake Lacy, Kate McKinnon, Beck Bennett and Jay Pharoah. The film is about a group of college friends who get together in their final year to play a game of intramural football.[21]  Music [ edit ]  Reed recorded a song, ""Now That I've Found You"", with her then-husband Paul McDonald, which debuted on Ryan Seacrest's radio show on November 15, 2011.[22] The couple released their first EP, The Best Part, on October 29, 2012.[23] Their song ""All I've Ever Needed"" is on The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 soundtrack.[24]  In January 2013, Reed filmed Hanson's 2013 music video for their single, ""Get the Girl Back"",[25] also with McDonald. The video was released in April 2013. Other well-known figures in the video include Kat Dennings, Drake Bell, Drew Seeley, Amy Paffrath, and Alex Beh.  Writing and directing [ edit ]  Reed wrote a script set in New Zealand between the 1960s and the 1980s. She has said she feels more versatile than her typecasting in roles of ""sexy bad girls."" She has sometimes been told by producers that she is too ""sexy"" for a particular part.[2] In November 2009, Reed directed a music video for her friend Sage while in London. Reed stated that they didn't have much time, or money, but she takes great pride in it.[26][27] Reed also intends to direct a music video for the independent rock band 100 Monkeys,[28] which is fronted by her Twilight co-star, Jackson Rathbone.  Personal life [ edit ]  Reed met Paul McDonald, a singer-songwriter and former American Idol contestant, on the red carpet at the premiere of Red Riding Hood in March 2011. This moment was broadcast on an American Idol episode as part of a segment that showed the contestants attending the premiere.[29] The couple began dating,[30] and moved in together not long after.[31] They confirmed their engagement in June 2011,[32] and married on October 16, 2011, in Malibu, California.[33] In March 2014, Reed and McDonald announced that they had separated after living apart for the previous six months due to ""work obligations"".[34] Reed filed for divorce in May 2014, citing ""irreconcilable differences"",[35] and the divorce was finalized on January 2, 2015.[36]  Reed began dating actor Ian Somerhalder in mid-2014.[37] They confirmed their engagement in February 2015,[38] and married on April 26, 2015, in Malibu, California.[39] On May 4, 2017, the couple announced via Instagram that Reed was pregnant with their first child.[40] They welcomed their child, a daughter, Bodhi Soleil, on July 25, 2017.[41]  Reed is close friends with her Twilight co-star Jackson Rathbone[42][43] and Spy Kids actress Alexa Vega, who was her matron of honor at her first wedding.[44]  Activism [ edit ]  Reed teamed up with Staples and Do Something for their third Annual School Supply Drive in the summer of 2011. She is also an animal rights advocate. She volunteers at animal shelters in her free time and she designed a limited edition collar and leash for Gilt to benefit Aspca. On October 22, 2014, she was honored with the ASPCA Compassion Award for her contributions to animal welfare.[45]  Reed endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[46]  Filmography [ edit ]  Television Year Title Role Notes 2006 Sadie Campbell 6 episodes 2006 Justice Molly Larusa 1 episode 2015–2016 Sleepy Hollow Betsy Ross 15 episodes  Awards and nominations [ edit ]"

Of course, it's the same designer who created Kate's wedding dress for her big day in April 2011.  Kate arrived at the service hand-in-hand with the bridesmaids, including daughter Princess Charlotte, 3, who were dressed in white with rose-adorned headbands.  She teamed her ensemble with a matching Philip Treacy hat and shoes by Jimmy Choo.  Though undeniably stunning, the Duchess' choice created a stir as wedding protocol dictates that only the bride wears white when tying the knot.

It's the fourth time Kate has worn this outfit, including to Charlotte's christening in July 2015  (Image: PA)  It’s one of the first times we’ve seen the Duchess of Cambridge in public since she gave birth to her third child Prince Louis on April 23.  Kate wore a red bespoke Jenny Packham dress with a white lace collar to introduce her baby boy to the world, as she and William left the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital.

"Damn, mama! Kelly Rowland didn’t hold back with vivid descriptions of her post-baby body in her new book, Whoa, Baby! — and she made sure to cover some very sensitive topics.  “All that gnawing at your nipples will take its toll! In those early days, I was fascinated (my polite way of saying ‘horrified’) by the transformation of my boobs,” the 36-year-old singer wrote. “My nipples were HUGE — we are talking the size of Frisbees — and sometimes I could see these veins bulging out while I was nursing.”  In her book, Rowland details many of her own experiences to help new parents navigate the tricky territory of parenthood. (She and her husband, Tim Weatherspoon, welcomed their son Titan Jewell back in 2014.)  “My boobs themselves were so long and stretchy that I sometimes felt like I could’ve swung them over my shoulders,” the former Destiny’s Child singer continued. Rowland added that despite her previous breast augmentation, the size and shape of her breasts still changed drastically from breastfeeding.  “Even with the silicon action, it was like some of the air had been sucked out and they just sort of hung there like flapjacks,” she said, noting, “I can’t speak for everyone, but I know I’m going to see someone (wink, wink) after I have my second kid. In the meantime, I just tried to enjoy my ability to feed my baby!”  In a recent interview with USA Today, Rowland also tackled another body part that changed dramatically following Titan’s birth: her vagina.  “Your vajayjay does not look the same for a very long time,” she told the publication, adding that a friend told her not to worry about how her nether regions looked. “But, I care about it. We got to get it all done up and trimmed and waxed and this and that and it’s all swollen and crazy and you’re just wondering, what just happened?”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

"Legal battle with ex husband leave's the star's family 'desperately worried about her.'  Despite a tumultuous custody battle with ex Kevin Federline, Radar Online reports that Britney Spears may have other things on her plate that would explain her erratic behavior.  The publication broke the news that Spears is “desperate” for Sam Asghari, her current love interest, to propose, “but he’s dragging his feet and stalling.”  After completing a successful run of shows in Las Vegas, Spears allegedly immediately turned her attention to tying the knot with her 23-year-old boyfriend.  The same source claims that the real reasoning behind Spears being impatient is because of her immediate urge to have children with Asghari.  “All she can talk about right now is having a baby. She wants a girl so bad and she’s madly in love with Sam.”  Asghari however, apparently is hesitant to act on Spear’s marriage advances, citing that he may not be mentally ready to completely settle down with the famous performer.  While this all occurs, Spears also is caught up in a heated legal battle with ex, Federline.  He is reportedly asking the star for more money in spousal and child support to help take care of himself along with their young children, Sean and Jayden.  Matthew Simmons / Getty Images  The same source mentioned that “She’s freaking out over this court deposition and doesn’t see an end in sight to all the ugliness with Kevin.”  Spears met Federline, a professional dancer, in April 2004 and, aside from the fact that he already had a child on the way with ex-fiancée Shar Jackson, whom, at the time, he had only been split from for a very short period. Federline and Spears were engaged by July of that year.  Their marriage ceremony took place on September 18, 2004, with son Sean Preston being born barely a year later. Jayden James, their second son, was born a year after that. However, by November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline and began pursuing other romantic interests.  All of the drama surrounding Spears is prompting those closest to her to state that they are worried she may spiral off into something akin to her most famous public meltdown over a decade ago when she had shaved her head amongst other media-covered reckless acts.  However, the source still described the situation best by saying that “There are still some major demons that Britney has to fight on a daily basis, and her workload never lets up. She feels the weight of the world on her shoulders right now, and her family’s desperately worried about her.”"
"Sandra Oh made history on Thursday, becoming the first Asian actor ever to receive an Emmy nomination in the best actress category.  The 46-year-old star, who leads BBC America’s Killing Eve, had previously been nominated for five supporting actress Emmys for her breakout role as Dr. Cristina Yang in ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy, which she starred on from 2005-14.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  She previously opened up about how she was shocked to have gotten the titular role in Killing Eve, explaining that she was used to being offered only supporting characters.  “When I got the script for Killing Eve, I remember I was walking around in Brooklyn and I was on my phone with my agent, Nancy. I was quickly scrolling down the script, and I can’t really tell you what I was looking for. So I’m like, ‘So Nancy, I don’t understand, what’s the part?’ ” Oh recalled to Vulture in April. “And Nancy goes ‘Sweetheart, it’s Eve, it’s Eve.’ “  Sandra Oh Dominik Magdziak Photography/Getty  Her surprise was the result of a bigger problem: racism she claimed to have experienced for so long in Hollywood that left her “brainwashed.”  “In that moment, I did not assume the offer was for Eve,” she said. “I think about that moment a lot. Of just going, how deep have I internalized this? [So] many years of being seen [a certain way], it deeply, deeply, deeply affects us. It’s like, how does racism define your work? Oh my goodness, I didn’t even assume when being offered something that I would be one of the central storytellers. Why? And this is me talking, right?”  “Racism exists. Let’s start there. I felt it, and I have felt it deeply. And I’m extremely fortunate. So I’m not going to not say that it’s not there, because it is,” she added. “After being told to see things a certain way for decades, you realize, ‘Oh my god! They brainwashed me!’ I was brainwashed! So that was a revelation to me.”  Ssandra Oh in Grey's Anatomy Randy Holmes/ABC via Getty  Although she has experienced the effects of racism throughout her acting journey, Oh said she believes in the power of positive perspective for minority performers.  “It’s changing the mindset that being an actor of color, person of color, that you’re at a disadvantage in the creative life. That you don’t have opportunity. It’s all how you see the opportunity. And the clearer and deeper you get into what you really want, you just become a better artist. If that’s what you really want — becoming a better artist — does that include access? Does that include having 5 billion Instagram followers? I don’t know. That’s for you to decide,” she told Vulture.  She continued: “But if what you want is to connect, if what you want is to be a great artist, I think you can find your way. Even within this giant paradigm that a lot of times doesn’t include people who look like us.”  Oh will face off against Elisabeth Moss (The Handmaid’s Tale), Claire Foy (The Crown), Keri Russell (The Americans), Evan Rachel Wood (Westworld) and Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) come Emmy night.  The 70th annual Emmys will air live from Hollywood on Sept. 17 (at 8 p.m. ET) on NBC."
"After being in limbo for three years after announcing their split in June 2015, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck‘s marriage has officially come to an end.  PEOPLE confirmed the two finalized their divorce on Thursday after they met at Garner’s house with lawyers and a private judge.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The finalization came one day after news broke the actress, 46, had requested a private judge to handle the final details of their divorce, according to court documents obtained by PEOPLE.  The estranged couple announced their separation after 10 years of marriage and three children together: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6. Affleck, 46, and Garner began dating in 2004 and married in June 2005 before simultaneously filing for divorce in April 2017.  In the time between their split announcement and the divorce filing, the former couple presented a largely united front as they went through challenges together — namely, Affleck’s recent rehab stay. Garner showed her support by driving him to the treatment facility.  Here’s an inside look into the former couple’s ups and downs.  “The Love of My Life”  Six months after the former couple announced their split, Affleck was living in the guesthouse of their family home — something that seemed to begin taking a toll.  “It’s obvious many times that they both find it annoying to deal with each other,” an insider told PEOPLE at the time. “Understandably so. It’s a strange situation to live together and yet be separated.”  Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck at the 2013 Academy Awards Jason Merritt/Getty  “They are doing what is working for the kids,” a Garner source noted of the living set-up.  For Affleck, keeping his mind on work apparently helped ease the pain of the separation. In September 2015, he was focusing on his directorial effort Live By Night and promoting Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. “He is happier and a more fulfilled person when he’s busy all day and night working,” a film source told PEOPLE. A source close to the actor added, “He is as happy as he can be in this position. I don’t think it’s that easy, and definitely not that easy to do it in the public eye.”  In February 2016, Garner opened up about the ongoing divorce in an interview with Vanity Fair. While the actress called Affleck “the love of my life,” she also opened up about their marital struggles, telling the magazine, “I always say, ‘When his sun shines on you, you feel it. But when the sun is shining elsewhere, it’s cold.’ He can cast quite a shadow.”  Affleck later told The New York Times, “She’s allowed to talk about it,” adding, “She felt like she wanted to discuss it and get it out there and get it over with so she could say, ‘Look, I already talked about it – I don’t want to do it again.’ ”  After celebrating Easter as a family in Los Angeles that year, Affleck and Garner spent a month in Europe with their kids while he filmed Justice League, including time in London and a family getaway to Paris. “She did have the best time in Europe with Ben and the kids,” a friend of Garner’s told PEOPLE. “She seemed to enjoy spending time with Ben again.”  Co-Parenting After Their Split  Garner and Affleck stayed close as they continued to live and vacation together as well as co-parent their kids — while also stepping out for solo outings. Shortly after announcing the separation, the entire family jetted off to the Bahamas to spend time together.  Jennifer Garner with her three children, Seraphina, Violet and Samuel at her Walk of Fame Ceremony in August Vince Flores/Startraksphoto.com  The family reunited again the following month in Atlanta, Georgia, where Garner was filming Miracles from Heaven. Affleck traveled to the Southern state to celebrate his 43rd birthday with his ex and the kids. “He’s happiest when he’s with his family,” a close friend told PEOPLE at the time.  In September 2015, the pair were spotted leaving a family counseling center in L.A. This marked their first visit to the center since announcing their divorce. Before their decision to separate, they attended weekly counseling sessions at the center but stopped going in the months leading to their split.  A source said they chose to remain friendly for reasons beyond parenting. “It’s not just for the kids – it’s also for them,” said the source. “They care about each other.” As the family continued to step out as a unit, observers noticed that Affleck and Garner seem to be looking happier after a tumultuous summer. “His family is all [Ben] cares about. This is what makes him happy and it makes sense that he looks happier,” another source told PEOPLE. “He enjoys the time with his family and that includes Jen.”  Since then, the two have worked hard at maintaining a harmonious relationship for the sake of their children. They recently took the kids to see Hello, Dolly! on Broadway in mid-July, starring family friend Victor Garber, and spent Easter together in Hawaii where Affleck was filming.  On Sunday, the two stepped out at church together with their children after Affleck completed 30 days in rehab. Three days later, Affleck and Garner stepped out with the kids again for a school event on Wednesday.  “He went to church on Sunday with his family,” a source told PEOPLE. The source added Affleck was smiling during the outing because the 30-day milestone means “he has reason to celebrate.”  From Coinage: See Where 6 Stars Were Before They Were Famous  Moving On  Affleck began dating Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus in 2017. The two made their relationship public when they were spotted grabbing dinner in July 2017.  The couple dated for more than a year, often taking trips together to Hawaii and Puerto Rico, where the actor was working. Affleck was even in attendance at the 2017 Emmy Awards in which Shookus, 38, took to the stage when SNL won for outstanding variety sketch series.  The two spent time together at Affleck’s home in Los Angeles and were often spotted grabbing dinner around the city.  In August 2018, a source told PEOPLE the two split because of the long distance between Affleck living in Los Angeles and Shookus being in New York. The two stopped being photographed together in July.  Upon his return to rehab, a source close to Shookus and Affleck told PEOPLE the producer “had been supporting Ben’s sobriety and going to meetings with him.”  “She had him in meditation and they were doing it together,” the source said. “His recovery was something that was very important to both of them.”  Ben Affleck and Shauna Sexton Lastarpix/BACKGRID  “It was very hard for her to break up with Ben, but she knew he wasn’t getting better and that it was time for her to step aside,” the source continued. “She was trying to stay as close to him as possible so that he would stay on the right path, but ultimately it just wasn’t possible. She knew she had to let him hit bottom.”  Not long after their split, the actor was spotted with 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton having dinner at Nobu in Malibu. Shortly after that, the two were seen visiting a Jack in the Box drive-thru together over the weekend.  In September, a source close to Affleck said he and Sexton were “just getting to know each other.“  The model has been photographed leaving the actor’s home, driving his SUV and visiting him in rehab. They were photographed together this week leaving his home as he continued rehab treatment.  Entering Rehab  Multiple sources told PEOPLE in August the two were close to finalizing their divorce in the weeks leading up to Affleck’s return to rehab.  A source told PEOPLE the two were still “working on” their divorce: “They’ve spent quite some time figuring out what works best for them and their family.”  Another source said in the days before Affleck’s trip to rehab, Garner was mostly concerned about their three children.  RELATED VIDEO: Ben Affleck Reveals He Completed 40-Day Rehab Stay: ‘I Am Fighting for Myself and My Family’  “Her number one concern is the kids,” the source said, noting that Garner struggles with questions like, “Is Ben healthy enough to have custody?” Added the source: “What she ultimately cares about is his sobriety and whether she can rely on him to co-parent.”  Affleck released a statement on Thursday addressing his rehab which he posted on Instagram.  “The support I have received from my family, colleagues and fans means more to me than I can say. It’s given me the strength and support to speak about my illness with others,” Affleck wrote. “Battling any addiction is a lifelong and difficult struggle. Because of that, one is never really in or out of treatment. It is a full-time commitment. I am fighting for myself and my family.”  If you or someone you know is in need of help, please contact the SAMHSA substance abuse helpline at 1-800-662-HELP."

"How intolerant can a group of people get, folks?If they don’t want to be a part of the country and culture then they should go back to where they came from. This should apply universally to all who chose to migrate.Wouldn’t it be a novel approach to do a story on what doesn’t offend Muslims? Perhaps we could figure out why they’re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if “western culture” offends them so!According to the Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Australia is enforcing democratic values and a “disputed view” of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs. According to their spokesman, Unthman Badar, “Requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of ‘forced assimilation’ of the Muslim community.”Here’s the pledge:From this time forward, [under God,]I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.Pretty oppressive, right? If you are graciously accepted into a country and you can’t even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? Here’s the national anthem:Australians all let us rejoice,For we are young and free; We’ve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature’s gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In history’s page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair.

In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair.Super oppressive lyrics, right?If a group of radicals cannot assimilate and integrate within a western society, they can go right back where they came from.Moreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that they will adhere to the principles and laws of that host country.If those seeking entrance cannot abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enter…it’s really that simple.Watch Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman, Unthman Badar, make the case against Muslim school children singing the national anthem. It begins around the 10 minute point.This is outrageous! Muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nation’s population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. WQe cannot let them get away with these things!Either assimilate, or LEAVE.They are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. Their only loyalty is to Allah. It’s their faith. The west doesn’t get it because most liberals are faithless.It irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then don’t want to be patriotic to that country.. How about you go back where your from!! Next they will demand that Australian’s convert or be beheaded!It makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldn’t pray… but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level! Next they won’t want to learn the country they have invaded history… because its not theirs!Muslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to.This what you get with Socialist politician bent on destroying their country.Do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?"

(Johnny Eggitt/AFP/Getty Images)  When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were married Saturday, there was one royal missing but not forgotten: Harry’s mother, Princess Diana.  Harry and his older brother, Prince William, have made sure to include their beloved late mother in their weddings.  [Listen on Retropod: Princess Diana’s final hours]  When William proposed to Kate Middleton in 2010, the engagement ring he gave her once belonged to Diana. And Harry proposed to Markle with an engagement ring containing diamonds from Diana’s jewelry collection. Markle is the same age as Diana when she died: 36.  Harry, Kensington Palace said in a statement this month, was “keen to involve his mother’s family in his wedding.”  Diana’s sister, Lady Jane Fellowes, gave a reading during the service at St. George’s Chapel inside Windsor Castle, which was decorated with white roses, Diana’s favorite flower. Diana’s two other siblings, Earl Spencer and Lady Sarah McCorquodale, also attended, with the Spencer family “helping to celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day.”  [Royal wedding 2018 live coverage]  Diana was devoted to her sons, and they were devoted to her. William was 15, and Harry was 12 when she was killed in a Paris car crash on Aug. 31, 1997. The boys were on vacation with their father, Prince Charles, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, and he delivered the news to them.  “One of the hardest things for a parent to have to do is to tell your children that your other parent has died,” Harry said last year in a BBC documentary that marked the 20th anniversary of her death. “How you deal with that, I don’t know.”  Diana was renowned for her grace, beauty, philanthropic work — and for her struggles with life in the royal family. She had divorced Charles and was estranged from him, but before her death, things were looking up.  She had a new beau, Dodi Al Fayed, and a whirlwind romance — passionate, thrilling, scandalous.  The last day of Diana’s life began on the top deck of yacht, with croissants and fresh jams. She and Fayed sipped their coffee, marveling at the breathtaking Emerald Coast in Sardinia.  “They were in a good mood,” his butler remembered later. “They were always laughing, holding hands.”  Fayed, the son of Harrod’s department store owner Mohamed Al-Fayed, was a rich playboy. Diana was the mother of the future King of England and the most photographed woman in the world.  [Queen Charlotte and the wedding of Britain’s first mixed-race royal]    Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed in St. Tropez on Aug. 22, 1997. (Patrick Bar/AP)  The tabloid attention on them was intense.  That Saturday — Aug. 30, 1997 — promised to be a moment of change. The princess knew it. She sneaked a call to Richard Kay, a friend who covered the Royals for the Daily Mail, and told him, as he later wrote, “she had decided to radically change her life.”  Diana had decided that starting that weekend she would withdraw from public life and wrap up her obligations with charities.  Diana had not told Kay why, but he had a hunch: “They were, to use an old but priceless cliche, blissfully happy. I cannot say for certain that they would have married, but in my view it was likely.”  In the 20 years since she’s been gone, there have been countless revisions to this love story. Her friends and relatives: They were not in love! His friends and relatives: They were in love!  Fayed wanted to propose that night, even though they had been dating less than a month. He had a diamond ring waiting in Paris, where he planned to pop the question over dinner.  [Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle: When royal wedding traditions fall]  As soon as they landed in Paris, Fayed saw the paparazzi out his window.  The couple headed for Fayed’s apartment — trailed, of course, by photographers. More were waiting at the building’s front door when they arrived. Fayed was irate. There was an ugly shoving match.

Coroner)  They tried to go to a restaurant — Chez Benoit, a cozy, casual bistro not far from the city center — but it was quickly overrun by photographers. They split and headed for The Ritz, ducking into the dining room hoping to be left alone. But other diners were staring.  The couple left and had their food delivered to the Imperial Suite. Fayed’s proposal plan was in shambles. The only option left was to head back to his apartment.  The hotel was swarming with photographers, so Fayed devised a plan: The couple’s driver and bodyguards would make a big show out front, appearing to get their caravan of Mercedes sedans ready to leave. Meanwhile, the princess and Fayed would slip out the back door and take a borrowed car driven by a hotel security officer.  The couple did get away, but what happened next was the subject of lengthy investigations and conspiracy theories that live on today. As the couple sped off, the photographers out front got tipped off about the escape, quickly catching up on their motorcycles. Their driver darted in and out of traffic, finally crashing inside a tunnel near the Eiffel Tower. It turned out he had been drunk behind the wheel.  Fayed died instantly. Diana died at the hospital. Her death startled the world.    Prince William (left) and Prince Harry, bow their heads as their mother’s coffin is taken out of Westminster Abbey after her funeral. (Adam Butler/AFP/Getty Images)  An up-and-coming anchor named Brian Williams broke into regular coverage on MSNBC to announce the news to Americans in the early morning hours of Aug. 31.  “I’ve just been handed from the Reuters news service what has been marked ‘bulletin,’ ” Williams said, speaking slowly. “It says, ‘Princess Diana has died.’ ”  In the BBC documentary, Prince William recounts “feeling completely numb, disorientated, dizzy — and you feel very, very confused. And you keep asking yourself, ‘Why me?’ the whole time. Why? What have I done, why has this happened to us?”  Harry remembers his initial reaction as “disbelief, refused to accept it. There was no sudden outpour of grief. I don’t think anybody in that position at that age would be able to understand the concept of what that actually means going forward.”  What it means: On Saturday, Harry married the woman he loves without the mother he loves.

"Angelina Jolie is allegedly surviving on little to no food, with sources questioning whether the stress of her divorce with Brad Pitt is to blame for her weight loss.  According to OK! Magazine, as cited by Gossip Cop, the actress has developed a smoking habit that’s so bad, she finds herself smoking an entire pack every single day, and to make matters worse, Angelina Jolie isn’t eating much on top of that.  Sources tell the publication that the A-list actress wakes up in the morning and finds herself smoking with a cup of coffee before the kids wake up, and she reportedly breaks the habit until her children are fast asleep before she carries on again.  Supposedly, Angelina Jolie smokes heavily throughout the morning and evening, and in the afternoon, there’s nothing that she consumes other than French cheese and expensive wine, which has greatly affected her weight, an insider stresses.  She’s nowhere near as healthy as she used to be, but the outlet fails to mention what her actual reasons are for this drastic diet she’s adapted to, though fans would want to believe that it’s presumably due to the supposed stress dealing with her divorce from Brad Pitt.  Whatever the case may be, it’s evidently clear that Angelina Jolie has been losing weight, which sources tell OK! Magazine is simply through the way that the mother of six has been treating herself as of late.  “Anytime I feel lost, I pull out a map and stare. I stare until I have reminded myself that life is a giant adventure, so much to do, to see.” – Angelina Jolie A post shared by Angelina Jolie (@angelinajolieofficial) on Nov 20, 2017 at 3:49pm PST  Angelina Jolie has never shied away from her dark past, which consisted of multiple health issues, but she has never commented on people’s recent concerns regarding her weight loss.  A statement regarding new claims about her unhealthy food intake will most likely not be addressed by the actress, for she has stayed away from even commenting on anything that concerns her weight.  Angelina Jolie has yet to finalize her divorce from Brad Pitt, as the couple continues to work out a custody plan with visitation rights that they are both in agreement with.  Despite OK! Magazine‘s claims, Gossip Cop‘s sources question the credibility of the outlet’s insiders, insisting that the story regarding Angelina Jolie’s weight loss is far from true.  Jolie famously filed for divorce last September, with reports at the time claiming that Pitt’s alcohol addiction had gotten so out of hand, it was beginning to affect everyone’s life around him, including his own family.  Angelina Jolie has remained single ever since."

"Scott Disick is sticking up for Khloe Kardashian.  In a sneak peek clip from an all-new episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, the 35-year-old reality star pulls a prank on Kris Jenner after Khloe claims she was art shamed by her famous momager.  Scott meets up with an actor named Richardson Jones, who he hires to play ""very famous artist"" Art Vandelay, a person made up by George Costanza on Seinfeld.  ""Today will be the day that we introduce Kris to this artist,"" Scott explains. ""Hopefully everything goes well and she falls for it.""  ""You have to remember here, this guy has absolutely no knowledge of art,"" he adds. ""The only thing he knows is how to basically pretend that he knows.""  When Kris arrives, Scott introduces her to Art immediately.  ""You're name is Art? And you're in an art gallery? And you're an artist?"" she asks. ""This is amazing!""  Trying to connect with her new artist pal, she then asks, ""Are you going to Art Basel again this year?"" to which he responded, ""Absolutely.""  In case you missed it, in another clip released earlier this week, Khloe accuses her mom of ""art shaming"" her when Kris suggests she go to an art class after she inquires about a piece of artwork in Kris' office.  ""Just because I'm not as knowledgeable as you, you shouldn't turn your nose up,"" Khloe argues. ""You should be like, 'Well Khloe, Jeff Koons is…' instead of making me feel less than and uneducated.""  ""You can't art shame people just because they know less than you,"" she continues. ""I'm your f**king daughter and you're art shaming me and it's mean.""  Keeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on E!

"We understand that this heroin is primarily coming from Mexico, over the border.Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole ""nay,"" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the ""black tar"" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico’s border, we were skeptical.Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.""Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,"" the report state. ""Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.""The report also says that Mexican ""transnational criminal organizations,"" (the DEA’s term for drug-dealing gangs) ""pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.""The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent.Smugglers’ creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.Our rulingPortman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico.

"Image zoom Photo Illustration. Photos: Shutterstock, Getty Images  If you've spent even .01% of your time watching the Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's love story unfold, you are well aware that comparisons Princess Diana has been invoked pretty often.  The late Princess of Wales has been mentioned constantly since the couple's engagement announcement back in November, and hey, we're just as guilty of waxing poetic about it too. But there's some truth to the comparison, even if you're a skeptic.  The Duchess of Sussex truthfully does have a good amount in common with her mother-in-law, to the point where the first ones to draw the parallel were actually Meghan and Harry themselves. They brought Di up in their engagement interview, where Harry made it clear how close he imagined they would be if his mother was still alive.  ""Oh they'd be thick as thieves, without question,"" Prince Harry said. ""I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, you know so excited for me, but then, as I said, would have probably been best friends—best friends with Meghan. It's days like today when I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news. But you know with the ring and with everything else that's going on I'm sure she's ... ""  "" ... she's with us,"" Markle finished.  RELATED: Singer Bryan Adams Was Asked Point-Blank About His Relationship with Princess Diana  Who are we to argue with that? Luckily we don't have to, since there's plenty of evidence to back it up, even without Harry's perspective in the mix. Allow us to break it down.  They are humanitarians.  This is probably the most striking comparison drawn between the two royals. Princess Diana was famously activism-focused. Her legacy is one of humanitarian work and beloved reverence now, but during her time as a princess while she was still alive, she was met with heated criticism for doing things like fighting the AIDS stigma in a time when even the U.S. president Ronald Reagan wouldn't acknowledge the disease existed. Not everyone understood what she was doing and why, but in hindsight, it all makes complete sense.  Markle has also shown herself to be an advocate, and she's spoken about gender equality, social justice, and feminism openly. Now that she has a larger global platform, it will be exciting to see what she chooses to do with it.  They're rule breakers.  As Markle gets the hang of this whole royals thing, she's made a few stumbles here and there. She's got good company, though. As some remember, Diana didn't always hesitate to break or bend the rules herself.  After choosing her own engagement ring and writing her own vows, she had Prince William and Prince Harry and insisted they went to school normally. That might seem like a ""no duh"" move now, but according to Good Housekeeping, William was actually the first heir to the throne to attend a public school. Ever.  Image zoom Tim Graham/Getty Images  That makes Markle walking herself partway down the aisle during the royal wedding seem like nothing.  Their parents are divorced.  Diana's father John Spencer and her mother Frances Spencer split when Di was seven years old. Markle went through something similar when her parents, Doria Ragland and the now-infamous Thomas Markle, separated when she was two years old, as she told Vanity Fair.  RELATED: Why Meghan Markle’s Wearing So Much Pink, According to Royal Experts  “What’s so incredible, you know, is that my parents split up when I was two, [but] I never saw them fight. We would still take vacations together. My dad would come on Sundays to drop me off, and we’d watch Jeopardy! eating dinner on TV trays, the three of us,"" she said. ""We were still so close-knit.”  They didn't date their future husbands long before getting engaged.  Harry and Meghan's seemingly whirlwind relationship drew ire from skeptics, since they only met in summer 2016, and were engaged November 2017. Turns out, Diana and her ex Prince Charles were the same before they wed. Princess Diana started dating Charles in summer 1980, and they were engaged by February 1981.  Their engagement rings coordinated.  The likeness of the two royals is physically manifested in the engagement ring Prince Harry gave Markle. Her ring includes two diamonds from Diana's collection, with the center stone being from Botswana.  Image zoom Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images  They weren't born royal.  They share this commonality with Kate Middleton as well. None of them were born into royalty, yet they all learned (and are learning) the ropes in their own ways.  RELATED: Meghan Markle Just Broke Her Silence on Her Marriage to Prince Harry and It’s … Something  All that said, they do have unique differences.  Of course, it's evident that they aren't twins, and it isn't fair to pass them off that way for the rest of Meghan and Harry's lives. The differences are also there. Diana grew up in a well-known British family that had ties to Queen Elizabeth from the get-go. Markle, on the other hand, was born in Los Angeles to a yoga instructor and lighting director.  Unlike Diana, Meghan wore two dresses at her wedding. Markle's family didn't meet the royals until days before the wedding, and her dad still hasn't met Harry, unlike Diana, who had closer ties to the royals long before she started dating Charles. Markle had been married and divorced before marrying Harry. There doesn't seem to be a Camilla Parker-Bowles-like figure in the dynamic between Harry and Meghan like there was for Charles and Diana.  But still, it's nice to peer closely at what they do have in common."

"Former aide to President Trump Omarosa Manigault Newman was asked by her “Celebrity Big Brother” co-star if she ever had a sexual relationship with the commander-in-chief.  The former “Apprentice” star, who worked for the Trump administration as the director of communications for the White House, was asked during Friday night’s episode of the reality show if she slept with Trump, Entertainment Weekly reported.  OMAROSA USED ‘STRICTLY FORBIDDEN’ WHITE HOUSE CAR SERVICE FOR HER COMMUTE: REPORT  “Did you ever sleep with him?” asked Brandi Glanville, star of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.”  “Who?” Manigault Newman responded.  “Trump,” Glanville said.  “Hell no! Oh, my God. Brandi, that’s horrible,” Manigault Newman said.  However, the former White House aide appeared to hint that another person was having sexual relations with people in the White House.  “There’s someone in the White House that’s sleeping with everybody, but she is not me… I’ve never had to do that,” she replied.  OMAROSA ON ‘CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER’: TRUMP TWEETS HAUNTED ME, HAD TO ‘SERVE’ MY COUNTRY  Glanville said she asked her the question because she heard rumors some “Celebrity Apprentice” contestants had sexual relationships with Trump when he was the show’s host.  Manigault Newman asked Glanville if she ever heard her name in the rumors.  “No. He seemed to like you so much, I was just wondering,” Glanville replied.  Manigault Newman snapped back, “God no, I’m just ratings gold.”  Since the “Celebrity Big Brother” premiere, Manigault Newman has continued to dominate the headlines with her remarks about her time in the Trump White House. Earlier this month, she tearfully confessed to being “haunted” by Trump’s tweets.  “I was haunted by tweets every single day,” she told contestant Ross Matthews. “What is he going to tweet next?”  In a Feb.12 episode, she trashed Vice President Mike Pence, calling him “scary.”  “Can I just say this, as bad as you all think Trump is, you’d be worried about Pence. Everybody that’s wishing for impeachment might want to reconsider their lives,” she said. “You would be begging for days of Trump back if Pence became president. He’s extreme. I’m Christian, I love Jesus. But he thinks Jesus tells him to say things, and I’m like, ‘Jesus didn’t say that.’ Scary.”  On Dec. 13, the White House announced Manigault Newman’s last day with the administration would be on Jan. 20, 2018 after she reportedly drew scrutiny from White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.  “Celebrity Big Brother” airs on CBS."
"Caitlyn Jenner told Diane Sawyer that she had undergone ""the final surgery"" in her gender reassignment procedures on Friday night's ""20/20"" special.  The former Olympian previously known as Bruce confirmed in her book ""The Secrets of My Life,"" coming out on Tuesday, that the 2017 ""surgery was a success.""  And Jenner said on the ABC interview, she had ""no regrets, none whatsoever.""  Beyond that, Jenner didn't want to talk about the details, telling Sawyer, ""I’m not going to dwell on that subject. It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.""  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been ""happy, peaceful…all of that confusion has left me….I did the right thing"" -- and doesn't miss ""Bruce"" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how—when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: ""When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.""  As many know from her former reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, ""Yes, I did vote for Trump.""  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, ""He wanted me to come play golf with him.""  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  ""It was extremely disappointing…you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,"" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is ""what's between your ears.""  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  ""Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,"" commented the former ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has ""never been on a date"" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.  Instead, Jenner is most focused on helping the transgender community through charities and building awareness about discrimination and other issues.  ""I want to fight this fight,"" she vowed.

"A lawsuit Kendall and Kylie Jenner were facing for a line of “vintage” tees featuring rapper Tupac Shakur’s image released by their eponymous clothing line, Kendall + Kylie, was dropped by the photographer who was suing the stars.  According to a document filed in federal court Wednesday, both parties are requesting to dismiss the suit brought forward by photographer Michael Miller last summer.  Miller was suing the Jenners for using his photos of Tupac Shakur without his permission, TMZ first reported. The shirts were part of a limited-edition Kendall + Kylie capsule collection that were on sale for $125 a piece, but immediately pulled from the site following the controversy.  Shutterstock; courtesy Kendall + Kylie  The sisters faced quite the backlash after the shirt’s design — which featured the sisters’ faces superimposed over images of famous deceased musicians including Tupac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G. and Jim Morrison of The Doors — first hit the internet.  RELATED PHOTOS: All of the KarJenner Fashion and Beauty Controversies  Paris Jackson and Kelly and Sharon Osbourne spoke out, The Doors issued a cease and desist letter and Notorious B.I.G.’s mom, Voletta Wallace shared her disappointment on Instagram.  The sisters issued an apology for their designs on Twitter soon after. “These designs were not well thought out and we deeply apologize to anyone that has been upset and/or offended, especially to the families of the artists. We are huge fans of their music and it was not our intention to disrespect these cultural icons in any way. The tee shirts have been pulled from retail and all images have been removed. We will use this as an opportunity to learn from these mistakes and again, we are very sorry,” they wrote.  Looking for more style content?

The brand released a statement to PEOPLE addressing the controversy over the summer. “The Kendall + Kylie brand apologizes for any insensitivity. When deciding to work with one-of-a-kind repurposed vintage tees, it was not the brand’s intent to offend anyone. These designs were randomly selected and not well thought out. The brand would like to apologize, especially to the artists that have been featured in the series. We did not mean to disrespect these icons and understand that we missed the mark completely. The designs have been removed. We sincerely apologize to the artists, their families and estates and anyone who may have been offended.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kendall and Kylie Jenner’s Apology Is Not Enough for Notorious B.I.G.’s Estate: ‘This Matter Has Yet to Be Resolved  The representative for the brand also added that the allegations on behalf of the photographer were “completely false,” calling the lawsuit “baseless.”  “Canada Inc., the licensee manufacturer of the K + K brand, purchased a very small quantity of vintage t-shirts with performer images already on them. Only two Tupac t shirts were sold before being pulled from distribution. Canada Inc. did not copy anyone’s image, remove any copyright notice from any image, or attempt to exploit Mr. Miller’s claimed right of publicity. There has been no infringement or violation of anyone’s rights. “"

"Christina Aguilera is one of the best vocalists in the pop music industry, but her record breaking success has been tainted by her tumultuous personal life. Her two and a half year relationship with Matthew Rutler appears to be solid and happy, but Star magazine claims that this is only smoke and mirrors. A source reveals, “Their relationship is convenient. It was always casual, very on and off, and not something Christina saw a future in.” The magazine further alleges that Aguilera is “ready for a new man” and that she’s “already on the prowl for a replacement.”  Aguilera’s temporary departure from The Voice signaled a massive change in her career. Not only did she regain the humungous success she once had, but she also built a completely new fan base from scratch. Aguilera has also been steadfast in her romantic affairs, but there’s still an opportunity for artistic ambition to give her relationship with Rutler a death blow.  This is, however, highly unlikely.  The source continues, “Christina plans on being ‘officially’ single by the time she begins promoting her new album and tour. She’s wasting no time setting her sights on a number of eligible bachelors. [She] wants an A-list boyfriend to complement her newfound confidence. All that’s missing is a hot, headline-stealing man on her arm. She’s already compiled a wish list that includes Colin Farrell and Jared Leto.”  Aguilera’s pop ballads speak of heartache and forlorn memories, so we doubt she’d put this spell on Rutler, especially since they’ve been dating for as long as Taylor Swift’s career.  It’s up to you to decide whether there’s any veracity to this story. What do you think? Do you think Aguilera is about to kick Rutler to the curb and headhunt a hot one?

"“Grey’s Anatomy” stars Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew are leaving the ABC drama, Variety has confirmed. The two actors will depart at the end of the show’s current and 14th season.  “The characters of Arizona and April are permanently woven into the fabric of Grey’s Anatomy thanks to the extraordinary work of Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew,” said executive producer Krista Vernof. “As writers, our job is to follow the stories where they want to go and sometimes that means saying goodbye to characters we love. It has been a joy and a privilege to work with these phenomenally talented actresses.”  “It’s always hard for me to say goodbye to any of my characters,” said executive producer Shonda Rhimes. “Both Arizona Robbins and April Kepner are not only beloved but iconic — both the LBGTQ and devout Christian communities are underrepresented on TV. I will be forever grateful to both Jessica and Sarah for bringing these characters to life with such vibrant performance and for inspiring women around the globe. They will always be a part of our Shondaland family.”  Capshaw and Drew’s departures follow the signing of series star Ellen Pompeo to a lucrative deal that will keep her with the drama franchise and pay her as much as $20 million per season. Rhimes last year signed an overall deal with Netflix worth $100 million, that takes her away from her longtime home at ABC Studios, which produces “Grey’s Anatomy.”  Deadline first reported the departures."
"Annabelle Neilson died suddenly from a stroke, the West London Coroner’s Court confirms to Us Weekly.  A spokesperson for the coroner tells Us, “The cause of death was cerebrovascular accident,” using the official medical term.  As previously reported, the Ladies of London star died on Thursday, July 12, at the age of 49. London’s Metropolitan Police Service told Us Weekly that the death was not being treated as suspicious.  Neilson worked as a model for years and was close friends with fashion designer Alexander McQueen, who died by suicide at age 40 in February 2015. She joined the Bravo reality series in 2014 but announced her exit the following year after two seasons. In more recent years, she worked as a children’s author, writing a series of books titled The Me Me Me’s, which were inspired by her struggles with dyslexia.  The reality star, who was raised in a wealthy British aristocratic family, had spoken candidly through the years about her past. She battled drug addiction and mental health issues after being assaulted at age 16 during a trip to Perth, Australia.  “I fell into a serious depression and became a heroin addict because it provided an escape bubble and was the only way I could cope,” she told the Daily Mail in December 2015. “In a way, heroin saved me, because otherwise I would have killed myself.”  Neilson was married to banker Nathaniel Rothschild from 1994 to 1997.  She is survived by her parents, Max and Elizabeth, and her sister, Millie.

"He’s the king of her heart! Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, enjoyed a dinner date in London on Wednesday, August 22.  The low-key couple stepped out at Hawksmoor, a steak restaurant in the Covent Garden district of the U.K. capital. They held hands as they walked down the street to the award-winning eatery.  The 10-time Grammy winner, 28, looked stunning in an emerald-green off-the-shoulder maxidress. She coordinated her black leather clutch with a matching belt and sandals. Her hair was styled in a loose updo. The Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk star, 27, opted for a more casual look with a blue long-sleeved henley, dark jeans and sneakers.  Swift and Alwyn’s relationship first made headlines in May 2017, though she hinted on her album Reputation that it began around late 2016. Neither have spoken publicly about their romance.  “Joe has really showed her a different lifestyle and the value of privacy,” a source previously told Us Weekly exclusively of the songstress, who in the past made headlines for flaunting her romances. “She’s the happiest she’s ever been.”  The British actor has joined the pop superstar on several dates of her ongoing Reputation stadium tour, which kicked off in May and concludes in November. “He’s very supportive of her career and wants to be there every step of the way,” the source told Us.

"Zayn Malik and Harry Styles will always be linked in the public eye, as the two were the most prominent members of One Direction. That being said, it looks as though their relationship is growing strained as they pursue successful solo careers.  According to HollywoodLife, Zayn is growing increasingly fearful that Harry’s new solo material will outshine his own. A source close to the “Pillow Talk” singer revealed that he’s “been flying high on his success as a solo artist, but he’s stressing now that Harry’s coming out with a new album. He’s worried that Harry is going to steal his thunder and overshadow what he’s worked so hard for.” Check out the video teaser for Harry’s debut single, due out April 7th.  The source goes on to say that “Out of all the 1D guys, Harry is the one Zayn has always felt the most competitive with, and with good reason. He’s been hearing from music insiders that Harry’s new work is the bomb, it’s edgy, it’s different, and it’s going to dominate the charts.” Zayn’s exit from the group was amicable in 2015, and there was never any ill will towards his One Direction peers, as he told The Sun: “I feel like I’m doing what’s right– right by myself and right by the boys, so I feel good.”  Nevertheless, will the stress of Harry’s musical buzz lead to a legitimate musical feud? Both albums are tentatively scheduled for sometime this summer, only furthering what seems to be a competitive rollout in the making. In the meantime, listen to Zayn’s latest single, “Still Got Time,” below."

This will be a daily reminder for me to share my gratitude with those I love as to never waste another minute….thank you. — Katie Cassidy (@MzKatieCassidy) November 24, 2017  The Partridge Family star and Katie, 30, had a complicated relationship: Though Katie was raised by her mother, former model Sherry Williams, and her stepfather, Richard Benedon, David still played a role in her life.  “Because I didn’t raise her, I didn’t have to parent her,” David told PEOPLE in 2009. “I’m always here and totally nonjudgmental.”  “To be able to go to someone I’m genetically linked to, tell them anything and know that they’re not going to judge me — it’s unbelievable,” Katie said at the time. “It’s nice when your dad can be your friend.”  But over time, the pair drifted apart. In February, David confessed to PEOPLE that the two were no longer in contact.  “I wasn’t her father. I was her biological father but I didn’t raise her. She has a completely different life,” he explained. “[But] I’m proud of her. She’s very talented. It’s hard for me to even accept how old she is now.”  Katie and David Cassidy in 2007 Krista Kennell/ZUMA  RELATED: David Cassidy — Looking Back at the Late Teen Heartthrob’s Ups and Downs  David had been in intensive care since he was hospitalized for liver and kidney failure last week.  “On behalf of the entire Cassidy family, it is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our father, our uncle, and our dear brother, David Cassidy,” his family said in a statement to PEOPLE on Tuesday. “David died surrounded by those he loved, with joy in his heart and free from the pain that had gripped him for so long.

"Whitney, a new documentary about Whitney Houston that debuted at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday, revealed new details about the late iconic singer.  The documentary, directed by Kevin Macdonald, suggests that Houston was allegedly sexually abused as a child by Dee Dee Warwick, Houston’s cousin and the sister of soul singer Dionne Warwick.  The news comes near the end of the film, when Houston’s former longtime assistant, Mary Jones, alleges that Houston told her that she was molested as a young child by her cousin Dee Dee, the niece of Houston’s mother Cissy Houston.  READ MORE: Lorde apologizes for posting ‘poorly chosen’ Whitney Houston quote on Instagram  Jones mentions that Houston’s alleged molestation had a lasting effect on her life and contributed to her late-life drug problems.  “It made her question her sexual preference,” she says in Whitney. Jones also says that Houston never told her mother because “I think she was ashamed.”  Jones continues: “If Cissy had known, she would have done something about it, because Cissy loves her children.”  READ MORE: Lars von Trier serial killer movie causes mass walkout at Cannes  Houston’s half-brother Gary Garland-Houston also says he was molested between the ages of seven and nine by a female family member, and says his sister was abused too.  Dee Dee Warwick, who was 18 years older than Houston, died in 2008. She was twice nominated for a Grammy Award and sang backup for Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin and others.  The allegations made in the documentary Whitney, which was made with the cooperation of Houston’s family, immediately cast a new light on Houston’s troubled life.  The singer died at the age of 48 in 2012 from what was ruled an accidental drowning in a bathtub. A coroner’s report into her death cited heart disease and drug use as contributing factors. Houston never spoke publicly about her own alleged abuse.  READ MORE: Whitney Houston death: Bobby Brown says she didn’t die from drugs  “We always wanted our film to be a corrective to that tabloid story,” said producer Simon Chinn. “These are specific revelations that I think will get people to a deeper understanding of who Whitney was and in many ways redeem her as a person.”  Whitney, which is to be released in theatres July 7, suggests that the alleged incidents of abuse took place while Cissy Houston was touring. Houston, who had a daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, with Bobby Brown, is said to have insisted on taking Bobbi on tour with her.  Bobbi Kristina died in 2015. She was found unresponsive in a bathtub and died after being in a coma for six months.  Representatives for Dionne Warwick have not commented on the allegations.  —With files from the Associated Press"
"Producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd, who also oversaw the last show, will be reteaming with him for the 90th Academy Awards.  Jimmy Kimmel will be back as host of the Oscars when the 90th edition of the annual Academy Awards ceremony is held March 4.  The Academy and ABC announced Tuesday that the late night host will reunite with producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd for the 2018 show.  The trio teamed up for the first time for the most recent Oscar show Feb. 26, and while all three generally got good reviews, their contributions were overshadowed by the last-minute envelope gaffe that resulted in La La Land, and not the actual winner Moonlight, being announced as the best picture victor. As part of the official announcement, Kimmel joked, ""If you think we screwed up the ending this year, wait until you see what we have planned for the 90th anniversary show.""  As for ratings, their maiden effort resulted in a 4 percent drop in viewership from the prior year as the show attracted 32.9 million viewers.  Still, ABC, which was granted a larger advisory capacity about key elements of the show when the Academy renewed its contract with the network through 2028 last summer, was eager to see the host of its Jimmy Kimmel Live! invited back.  “Jimmy, Mike and Jennifer are truly an Oscar Dream Team,” Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs said in announcing their selection. “Mike and Jennifer produced a beautiful show that was visually stunning. And Jimmy proved, from his opening monologue all the way through a finale we could never have imagined, that he is one our finest hosts in Oscar history.”  Added Kimmel, “Hosting the Oscars was a highlight of my career and I am grateful to Cheryl, [Academy CEO] Dawn [Hudson] and the Academy for asking me to return to work with two of my favorite people, Mike De Luca and Jennifer Todd.""  “It’s not often you get two chances to have a once-in-a-lifetime experience and even more rare to be handed the keys to a party 90 years in the making,” De Luca and Todd offered in a joint statement. “We always thought the idea that anything can happen on the Oscars was a cliche until we lived it.”  ""Our Oscars team this year delivered a show that hit every high note,"" Hudson said. ""Jimmy brought back the essence and light touch of the greatest hosts of Oscars past. Mike and Jennifer's love of movies is infectious and touched every aspect of the show. This is the perfect team to lead us into the ninth decade.""  ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey observed, “After just one year, we can’t imagine anyone else hosting The Oscars. Jimmy’s skillful command of the stage is invaluable on a night when anything can happen — and does. With Mike and Jennifer at the helm, we’re ready for another unforgettable show that will dazzle, delight and, most importantly, honor 90 years of Hollywood’s most prestigious award.”  The early announcement represents something of a break with Academy tradition, which in the past has first seen the Academy president select the show's producers and the producers then pick a host — a process that has sometimes resulted in a protracted search. Boone Isaacs, having completed four successive, one-year terms as president, will be stepping down in July, as the Academy's board of governors elects a new president. But rather than wait for a new president to take over, the Academy is moving forward with plans for next year's show.  The early announcement is not unprecedented, though. In both 2013 and 2014, the Academy announced in mid-April that producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, who first produced the 2013 show, would be returning to produce both the 2014 and 2015 shows. Both the Academy and ABC prefer to have producers who've already cut their teeth on one broadcast returning to handle the next year's show, because it eliminates the learning curve facing new producers and provides for continuity of staffing.  Extending an early callback to Kimmel, De Luca and Todd, ensures that all three will have plenty of time to prepare for next year's show, which doesn't take place until the first Sunday in March so as not to conflict with the closing ceremonies of the winter Olympics, which will be taking place the last weekend of February. Last year, Todd and De Luca were not named to produce the 89th Oscars until early November, and Kimmel wasn't given the hosting assignment until early December. ""I had to be at least eighth [choice],"" Kimmel joked to THR. ""It took so long for them to ask."""

"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Lindsay Lohan, whose promising movie career crashed in a string of legal woes and substance abuse, is returning to U.S. television in a reality series about her night club ventures in Greece.  MTV said on Monday that “Lohan Beach Club” will follow the actress as she works to expand a recently launched nightclub and restaurant business in Greece.  The TV network said the show, expected to air in 2019, will see Lohan, 32, lead a team of “brand ambassadors” who will help promote her business “while striving to rise above the temptations the Mykonos night life scene has to offer.”  Lohan, once one of Hollywood’s most-sought after young actresses after starring roles in “The Parent Trap” and “Mean Girls,” went to rehab six times between 2007 and 2013, and was in and out of jail and court repeatedly for offenses ranging from theft to drunken driving and drug possession.  Her last feature movie was the 2013 low-budget thriller “The Canyons” after which she moved to London, and later Dubai. Her biggest acting job since then is dark British TV comedy “Sick Note,” in which she plays a supporting role in the second season that began airing last week.  The Mykonos beach club is Lohan’s third business venture in Greece following the 2016 opening of a nightclub bearing her name in Athens and a beach house in Rhodes which is due to open this summer.

"Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux Latest Rumors: ‘Friends’ Alum to Pay ‘The Leftovers’ Actor Millions for His Silence?  Monday, July 23, 2018 5:09 AM UTC  Following the split of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux, a lot of rumors have been speculating on what’s going on behind the scenes. The most recent of these is the regurgitated claim that the “Friends” actress is willing to shell out $6.7 million to buy the silence of her ex-husband, as OK! Australia reported (via Gossip Cop).  Allegations are making the rounds that Justin Theroux is projected to make a lot of money if he writes a book regarding his relationship with Jennifer Aniston. The former celebrity couple had been together for seven years and were married for three, so it goes without saying that Justin knows about Jen’s personal life quite a bit.  However, there is no certainty of any payout whatsoever that has been confirmed by Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux. Friends and close acquaintances of the two also didn’t mention such an agreement, which would make these stories a complete fabrication.  Tabloids have been quick to spew these stories after Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux’s breakup, creating claims that would make catchy headlines. What’s more, the origins of these outright lies are mostly written by magazines that are managed by the same company.  For instance, OK! Australia and Radar Online are overseen by American Media Incorporated. Both these magazines have published stories in the past that were questionable at best and obviously deceptively at worst. Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are but the latest subjects that these tabloids are covering since their breakup is relatively new.  The ex-couple previously said that while they decided to end their relationship, they’re doing so with no resentment towards each other. In fact, the two even released a statement that even though they’re separated, they still want to maintain their relationship as friends. So the rumors that Justin Theroux is writing a book about his time with Jennifer Aniston to simply make a quick profit are simply unfounded."

"After being courted for several months, Leonardo DiCaprio will star in Quentin Tarantino’s untitled Charles Manson movie, sources confirmed to Variety.  DiCaprio will play an aging, out-of-work actor in the film. Margot Robbie, meanwhile, is being eyed for the role of Sharon Tate.  This will mark DiCaprio’s first film since winning the Oscar in 2016 for his performance in Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s “The Revenant.” DiCaprio and Tarantino last collaborated on 2012’s “Django Unchained.”  He is repped by LBI Entertainment.  As previously reported, Tom Cruise is also being pursued to star in the director’s ninth feature. Sources now tell Variety that Tarantino is interested in casting Al Pacino in the film as well. Sony is handling distribution.  The movie will hit theaters on Aug. 9, 2019, Variety has learned. Opening on the 50th anniversary of the day that the Manson family committed the LaBianca murders and the day after Tate was killed, the film will head off against “Artemis Fowl,” Disney’s adaptation of the popular sci-fi and fantasy series.  Sony beat out several bidders, including Warner Bros. and Paramount, for rights to the film. The movie — shrouded in secrecy — is set in 1969 and is believed to involve Charles Manson and the Manson family murders. The director has told media outlets that it’s not a biopic, but is an ensemble film set during the tumultuous time period. It’s the first pic that Tarantino is releasing without the Weinstein Company. A group of investors led by Maria Contreras-Sweet is in a strong position to buy the Weinstein Company following sexual misconduct allegations against its disgraced founder Harvey Weinstein.  Deadline Hollywood first reported the news."
"Kourtney Kardashian may be at it again. In recent weeks, both Kim Kardashian and her younger sister, Kylie Jenner have welcomed new baby girls after super secret pregnancies. Add in the fact that middle-sister Khloe is also pregnant and expecting her first child in early April, according to her Twitter, and the Kardashian clan couldn’t be happier. Still, you’ve heard the saying ‘when it rains it pours.’ Sure enough, ENews’ sneak peeks of the newest episode airing this Sunday, February 25 show Kourtney dishing to her sisters about a potential little cousin for brand new babies, Chicago and Stormi. So, straight up: Is Kourtney Kardashian pregnant? Is she really going to freeze her eggs?  While there are no confirmations at this point that Kourtney Kardashian is pregnant, Kourtney’s own words suggest she’s got baby number four on her mind. And we know KUWTK crews film episodes several weeks to months before they air. Spoiler videos for this Sunday’s episode, “Trimester Trouble,” reveal Kourtney’s plan to freeze her eggs as “insurance,” that she can have a fourth child in the future. So will we know at the end of this episode if Kourtney’s going to freeze her eggs?  Kourtney also revealed that she uses an IUD as birth control with her current boyfriend, model, Younes Bendjima, 24. Adding, however, that she wouldn’t mind taking it out if her partner wanted children in the near term. It seems that the Kardashian women are on a pregnancy roll. But what about the boys, or should we say, Kardashian Kastoffs?  Kardashian Exes Talk Babies and New Boyfriends  Khloe’s ex-husband, Lamar Odom discloses in a not-yet-aired interview with Access Hollywood, that he’s happy for Khloe about her pregnancy with new boyfriend, Cavaliers player, Tristan Thompson. Lamar can be heard saying that, “it couldn’t happen to a better person,” US Magazine reports. Still, he admits hearing the bombshell Khloe divulged in the season 13 finale, that she was only “fake trying” to get pregnant while she was married to him, was “hurtful.”  Similarly, Kylie’s famous on-again-off-again ex-boyfriend, Tyga had good things to say about Kylie and her new baby. He told radio interviewer, DJ Akademiks that, “there’s no bad blood, no problems.” And while the 28-year-old rapper didn’t comment on Stormi specifically during this interview, he did admit that he and Kylie still “communicate.” And that did nothing to squash internet rumors that Tyga may be the biological father of the 20-year-old cosmetics mogul’s new daughter.  And what about Kourtney’s ex and baby-daddy, Scott Disick? The man who got Kourtney Kardashian pregnant three times in the past is plenty busy hitting the town with new girlfriend, 19-year-old Sophia Richie, younger daughter of Lionel Richie. And on the Rob Kardashian front, there’s not much news yet. Momager Kris’s only son, Rob, has not found love again. At least not after his much-publicized breakup with Blac Chyna, the mother of one-year-old Dream Kardashian. But with all these new babies on the scene, who has time to date?"

"At an intimate show in his hometown of Tishomingo, Oklahoma, February 9, Blake Shelton offered the crowd plenty of their favorites — including his girlfriend, Gwen Stefani. “Gwen sat in the stands and was grooving along,” a concert-goer says in the new issue of Us Weekly. “Blake sang a lot in her direction.” At one point, he even shared a sweet detail of their home life, says the witness: “Their dog was having puppies and they couldn’t wait to get home!”  For now, those furry family members are serving as surrogates of sorts. “Blake and Gwen have decided to put plans to have a baby on hold,” an insider shares in the new issue. “Their feeling is if it happens naturally, great. But they’ve decided to not focus on it for the time being.”  Stefani, 48, and Shelton, 41, have been trying to conceive for over a year, the source reveals. But the one blessing of their struggle is that it’s made them stronger than ever. The source says Shelton is “absolutely devoted” to Gwen’s sons, Kingston, 11, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4: “Blake is extremely attentive, loving and doting towards Gwen and the boys.”  Shelton’s devotion is part of what made the couple try for a child together. “Blake has always wanted children,” explains a friend. “And he’s great with Gwen’s kids, which prompted them wanting their own.”  The No Doubt singer was all in — but not anymore. “Not because of a change in her love for Blake,” explains the source, “but because she feels as if it might not be meant to be.” The country star is on board with her thoughts. “He is completely at peace with the prospect of not having any biological children of his own,” shares the insider.  With no baby, they’ve also put their wedding plans on hold. Says the source, “Gwen is very traditional and wouldn’t want to be pregnant without being married.”  Still, things are hardly cooling off for the Voice coaches. “Their relationship has grown and matured into a stable, loving union,” explains the source. “The need to get married and have kids isn’t the priority it once was.”  When the duo first announced they were dating in November 2015, they were both going through emotional divorces. Stefani split from the father of her boys, Gavin Rossdale, after being married for 13 years, and Shelton had recently ended his four-year union with Miranda Lambert.  Now, the pair have settled in to an “easy, effortless love” together, says the source. That includes spending plenty of time on Shelton’s Oklahoma ranch — something the glamour girl surprisingly adores! Another favorite activity? “Gwen loves hanging out with Blake’s friends and wives,” says the source. The low-key loves enjoyed a couples’ trip with pals in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, this January.

"Robert Pattinson and Charlie Hunnam weren't on The Lost City of Z set to make friends.  ET's Ashley Crossan caught up with the actors at the movie's premiere in Los Angeles, California, on Wednesday, and Hunnam explained why he rarely spoke to his co-star when the cameras weren't rolling.  ""There was something really exciting about the idea of not knowing someone, just letting a relationship exist exclusively on the screen,"" the 36-year-old actor noted. ""So, I had decided that I wanted to do that, but sometimes that can be alienating, and [can] put another actor off of their work and I don't want to be that selfish.""

"Will Smith has learned a thing or two in the two decades that he’s been married to wife Jada Pinkett Smith.  On Sunday, the 49-year-old actor celebrated the couple’s 20th wedding anniversary by sharing some of the lessons he’s learned since they first said “I do.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “20 Years Ago Today we held hands and walked naively down that aisle. Here’s what I’ve learned since,” he wrote alongside a photo of the couple from their wedding day in 1997.  “Love is Like Gardening,” he wrote. “I have learned to focus on HELPING you to BLOSSOM into what YOU want to be (into what you were born to be)… Rather than Demanding that you become what my Fragile Ego needs you to be.”  He also added, “I’ve learned to take pleasure in Nourishing YOUR dreams… Rather than wrestling with you to Fulfill my Selfish Needs & Satiate My Insecurities.”  “I have learned that Love is Listening. Love is Giving. Love is Freedom,” he continued. “Happy Anniversary, My Queen! I am forever Devoted to Nurturing your Deepest Truth.”  RELATED VIDEO: Scoop: Jada Pinkett Smith Says She Wishes Those Rumors about Her and Husband Will Smith Being Swingers Were True  In 2015, Pinkett Smith, opened up about the one thing her relationship to her husband really boiled down to: trust.  “You gotta trust who you’re with,” she told Howard Stern in an interview that aired on his Sirius radio show. “At the end of the day, I’m not here to be anybody’s watcher … he’s a grown man.”  “Thank God I have a husband who’s just a gangster partner because can you just imagine taking that road together from 25 to 44?” she continued. “You’ve got to be strong … it takes work.”  Jada Pinkett Smith (left) and Will Smith Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat  The pair have also had to put up with countless rumors throughout their lasting relationship: including one about them being swingers.  During a visit to Watch What Happens Live in July, Pinkett Smith, 46, dispelled the claims, adding that she wished they were true. “I’m like, ‘Yo, I wish. I wish!’ ” she said.  Her Girls Trip and Set It Off costar Queen Latifah, who appeared alongside her on the popular Bravo late night show, seemed disappointed to hear the gossip was false.  “I’ve always admired that about you. Don’t take that away from me!” Latifah joked. “I’ve compared you to every relationship I’m in. I’m like, ‘It’s the perfect way!’ ”  Will Smith (left) and Jada Pinkett Smith Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat  Asked whether the couple had any tips for keeping the romance hot, the mother of two responded, “I don’t know!”  “I mean, I’m baffled, really. Will and I just have amazing chemistry on a lot of different levels. We love to laugh together, we love to learn together, and we just love each other. We just have a good time together,” she continued.  “Yeah, I guess that’s the secret. Yeah, we just really like each other!” she added.  The pair have two children together — Jaden Smith, 19 and Willow Smith, 17. Smith also has a son from a previous relationship, Trey, 25."

"Taylor Swift’s squad used to roll deep, but lately, her besties are nowhere to be found.  Taylor Swift hasn’t been quite so good at “shaking it off” recently. Once Hollywood’s ultimate social butterfly, the pop star has remained mysteriously out of the spotlight this year — way out. Other than her July court hearing to testify against the DJ who was convicted of groping her, she hasn’t made any public appearances in nearly nine months. Paparazzi have only gotten glimpses of her, bundled in hoodies and dashing into cars with her new boyfriend, British actor Joe Alwyn, 26. She deleted her entire Instagram history in August, before dropping her provocative comeback single “Look What You Made Me Do,” but she still hasn’t come out from underground.  Part of the reason, insiders tell OK!, is that Taylor’s well-documented drama — public spats with Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and Calvin Harris, to name a few — got to be too much last year, so she made a dramatic decision to go into hiding and focus solely on her music. But a source says her self-inflicted sequestration is only spurring more curiosity: “Taylor grew tired of people over analyzing her life and passing judgment on her, but being so conspicuously absent from the Hollywood scene just has everyone wondering what’s going on with her.”  WHERE THE GIRLS AT?  Even members of Taylor’s famed “squad” have indicated that she’s not as prese"
"Carey and Montana recently worked together on a remix of his hit single “Unforgettable,” and now Life & Style is claiming the two were all over each other during the process. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “Mariah was hanging all over French. She sat on his lap, and at one point they even kissed! They weren’t trying to hide their PDA.”  A new tabloid report says there was heavy flirting going on between Mariah Carey and French Montana when the two recently collaborated in the recording studio. Gossip Cop looked into this claim about a possible hookup between the music artists, and we’ve exclusively learned the truth.  {""position1"": {""artist"": {""bio"": """", ""id"": 31885, ""name"": ""Mariah Carey""}, ""catalog_type"": ""artist"", ""description"": """", ""id"": 31885, ""name"": ""Mariah Carey"", ""related"": [{""bio"": """", ""id"": 966208, ""name"": ""Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 89006, ""name"": ""TLC""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 120430, ""name"": ""Aaliyah""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 40100, ""name"": ""Boyz II Men""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 56563, ""name"": ""Alicia Keys""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 39258, ""name"": ""Mary J.

Our doubts were confirmed after checking in with a rep for Carey, who exclusively tells us the outlet’s report is entirely “false.” We’re assured the singer wasn’t flirting with her colleague, nor did the two go home together.  Naturally, Life & Style isn’t the best source when it comes to finding accurate news about the singer. Gossip Cop previously busted the tabloid for making up a story about Carey hiring a speech therapist to teach her to speak with a British accent. GC also corrected the magazine after it falsely claimed Carey gives money to boyfriend Bryan Tanaka so he can buy her gifts. The publication’s latest article suggesting Carey and Montana are more than just collaborators is equally bogus.  Photo: AOL"
"At this point, it's not a question of if Kim Kardashian (or any of her famous family members, for that matter) will be criticized for each of her parenting decisions, but rather, when the comments from Internet trolls will start rolling in. The latest instance of mommy-shaming plaguing Kardashian was sparked by a throwback photo of her husband and daughter that she posted on Instagram on Tuesday. In the pic, North West cuddles up to Kanye West and gives her smiling dad a kiss on the cheek. ""I can still feel the love 💕,"" Kim K captioned the adorable snapshot, quoting Kanye's recently released song "" Feel the Love .""  Almost immediately, critics began pouncing on Kardashian over the fact that, in the picture, North is wearing her naturally curly hair straight. ""I can feel the heat damage from here! Leave your [kid's] hair alone let her have the choice to damage it when she's older,"" one person commented. ""Stop straightening her hair,"" someone else wrote, while another added, ""That poor baby's curl pattern is gonna be all jacked up from the heat damage she's putting on her hair at a young age.""  Others, however, defended Kardashian, citing both her right to parent her children however she wants and the well-documented fact that North is already a burgeoning style star at just five years old. ""Y'all are so annoying. Maybe NORTH wanted her hair that way!!!!!! She's very opinionated as we can all see. AND it's VERY easy to straighten hair without heat damage seeing as [how] her mom has a TEAM of PROFESSIONAL hairstylists,"" one of her defenders wrote.  Loading View on Instagram  Last month, after catching similar flack for letting North wear her hair straight on her birthday, Kardashian West explained the decision to The Hollywood Reporter . ""She wanted straight hair and I straightened her hair one time. It's funny, because online everyone thought that we pressed it and did this whole thing. It was just a flat iron. I even read that she had extensions on! She has curly hair, so when you straighten her hair, it's gonna look really long. I can't believe people didn't get that. Sometimes you just have to tune it out! It was her birthday and all she wanted was to try to have her hair straightened,"" she said.  The KKW Beauty founder noted that her own professional hairstylist, Chris Appleton , helped out with North's special style, and added, ""She liked it, so we did it when we went to New York too, and that's it. You know, I'm not gonna let her straighten her hair all the time, but if she wants it that way two or three days a year, then that's fine with me. She loved it, but she loves her curly hair, too.""

"Kristen Stewart is spotted kissing her girlfriend Stella at Coachella (Picture: MEGA, Rex/Shutterstock)  Kristen Stewart and her Victoria Secret’s Angel girlfriend, Stella Maxwell, are known for keeping their relationship on the down low.  They have been dating ever since 2015, but only revealed they were an item a whole year after rumours started to circulate that they were seeing each other.  However, despite the hush around their romance, all of this seems to have gone out of the window at Coachella, as the pair are spotted putting on a passionate display of PDA.  What happens at Coachella stays at Coachella, right?  The couple had been hanging out with friends all day, but it looks like they’d been able to sneak away from the crowds and grab a moment alone as they were pictured together perched under a tree.  The pair have been dating since 2015 and generally keep their relationship under wraps (Picture: MEGA)  While enjoying each other’s company, the pair shared a kiss before heading back off to the festival to enjoy the rest of Saturday’s evening.  Advertisement  Advertisement  This photo has emerged after Kristen was rumoured to be meeting up with her ex flame Robert Pattinson.  The 28-year-old and her former Twilight co-star were allegedly spotted by fans having a drink together at a bar in California.  Five years after their massively public split, onlookers took to Twitter to share the news that they had finally reconciled.  However, it has recently been rumoured that Kristen has been meeting up with her ex flame Robert Pattinson (Picture: Getty Images)  One fan tweeted: ‘Was just at bar enjoying my friends birthday and in comes Robert Pattinson which blew my twilight mind up, and then Kristen Stewart walked in and now I’m reliving my highschool twilight fantasies.’  While some questioned whether it was true, someone shared that the place was so tiny it would have been ‘rude’ to take a snap. But enough fans tweeted the sighting that it appears to have been legitimate.  Twihards don’t get your hopes up though on the pair reigniting their relationship, as Kristen officially came out last year during an episode of SNL, where she revealed she is ‘like, so gay’.  Speaking with People on her decision to come out during the show, she said: ‘Considering I had so many eyes on me, I suddenly realized [my private life] affects a greater number of people than just me.

"Game of Thrones stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie's highly-anticipated wedding finally has an official date—and it's coming up very soon.  The couple will wed in less than a month, on June 23, according to a BBC report.  Per BBC: ""A 23 June date has been posted at the Huntly registration office in Aberdeenshire. The actress's father, councillor Seb Leslie, owns a castle in his West Garioch constituency.""  Harington and Leslie, who first met in 2012 on the set of hit HBO drama, announced their engagement last fall with an official announcement in the newspaper, which was absolutely adorable and old-fashioned.  Getty Images  ""MR. K.C. HARINGTON AND MISS R.E. LESLIE. The engagement is announced between Kit, younger son of David and Deborah Harington of Worcestershire, and Rose, middle daughters of Sebastian and Candy Leslie of Aberdeenshire,"" the announcement read.    As famous couples go, Harington and Leslie are relatively low-key, but they have spoken publicly about their romance on a few occasions.  Notably, Harington described falling in love with Leslie on set during a 2016 interview with L'Uomo Vogue. ""Because the country is beautiful, because the Northern Lights are magical, and because it was there that I fell in love,"" he said. ""If you’re already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love.""    Harington also opened up about his less-than-perfect proposal during an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show in October 2017.  ""I did have some plans to do it, I was going to string up some lights in some trees and do all the romantic stuff, but we were in the country and we were under this beautiful night sky and had a log fire burning and red wine and I blew my load early,"" he said, laughing. ""Sorry, that’s a really bad expression!"""

"Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  For those reeling from a rocky relationship, here’s some advice you can take at face value: get a nose job.  That’s exactly what 28-year-old reality TV personality, Naomie Olindo, decided to do less than half a year after breaking up with heartthrob, Craig Conover. On Thursday, the star of Southern Charm revealed the results of her makeover on Instagram, complete with a nose emoji to further press the point.  Admitting that a bit of swelling was still present in the wake of the procedure less than two weeks earlier, Olindo claimed during an interview on Bravo TV that she decided to take advantage of the show’s post-season hiatus to undergo the procedure. It stated it was something she had wanted to do since she was eight years old. She also said she suffered no pain at all while on the operating table.  Even before she shared the news, fans on social media pointed out that she didn’t quite look the same. However, after commenting on the change, Olindo got a few negative responses and quickly defended her decision. She noted she was happy about the effect of the results on her self-esteem and would do it again.  inquisitr.com  Her rhinoplasty venture might help her move on after splitting from Conover, a relationship that dominated story arcs during seasons three and four of Southern Charm. Olindo originally met Conover in South Carolina at the College of Charleston, but they actually started dating after they graduated.  The most recent season saw the two try to navigate stormy waters as audiences watched their relationship start to unravel, especially when Olindo and Conover underwent therapy to keep their connection from further fraying. Unfortunately, the twosome called it quits in September.  Even after the breakup, Olindo claims she's still the best of friends with Conover, adding that he provided a lot of support for her in a text regarding her nose job.  The two will also remain in the cast of the forthcoming fifth season of Southern Charm, which recently promoted recurring personality Chelsea Meissner to become part of the core ensemble. That decision seems to be a no-brainer, considering Meissner was at the center of a three-way relationship that sparked plenty of interest among viewers.

"They may keep a low profile, but rumored couple Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes definitely looked cozy at the actor's 50th birthday party!  Foxx celebrated his big day at Los Angeles' Paramount Studios on Wednesday, where he was not only joined by Holmes, but also A-list friends like Leonardo DiCaprio, Snoop Dogg, Tobey Maguire and Foxx's The Jamie Foxx Show co-star Garcelle Beauvais, as well as his daughters, 23-year-old Corinne and 8-year-old Annalise.  Splash News  Splash News  Though Foxx and Holmes are rarely spotted together, the two weren't shy inside the party.

Holmes had a huge grin on her face and was laughing at something he said during their chat.  An eyewitness tells ET that, inside the soiree, Foxx and Holmes ""seemed besotted"" with each other. ""Jamie kept beckoning for Katie to come up to the stage but she didn’t want to,” the eyewitness said. “They were so cute!”  Splash News  Foxx performed for the crowd, as did Snoop, Ice Cube and Ludacris.

"From Alexa Chung to January Jones and Chrissy Teigen, the sheet mask continues to adorn the faces of our favourite celebrities all over Instagram, and for good reason too. The biggest trend to come out of Korea, these skincare saviours give an instant hit of hydration, with specially formulated serums that quickly penetrate skin for maximum effect. Korean beauty boutiques are lined with hundreds of packets of different masks and women pick and mix to create a library of sheet masks to match every skin type and concern.  Happily, the Award Winning* Charcoal & Willow Bark Tissue Face Mask from Boots Ingredients is somewhat closer to home – it’s in November’s GLOSSYBOX in fact! A no mess sheet mask that helps purify, cleanse and revitalise skin with seriously soothing ingredients – and works in just 15 minutes! If you aren’t already a subscriber order your box here and get your hands on this (as well as four more full-size goodies).  Taking our cue from our Korean counterparts, here’s how to use your masks like a pro…  1. Take the mask out of the packet, unfold it and place it over your face, positioning it so you can see through the holes for your eyes. You can apply it directly to cleansed skin or you can apply a moisturising serum first to boost hydration. Extra points if you dunk the packet into warm water for one minute to allow it to heat up beforehand.  2. Firmly press the mask over the skin to encourage the product to penetrate effectively and ensure that it sits against skin especially around that awkward nose area.  3. After 15 minutes remove the mask, taking time to massage any residue that remains into the skin. You can also sweep the sheet over your throat and decollate (much like you would a serum-saturated cotton wool ball) to get the most of any serum that remains."

"CREDIT: Instagram/Erika Jayne  Like Lisa Rinna before her, Erika Jayne is stripping down for the camera.  Having been recently eliminated from Dancing with the Stars , the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star responded to haters on Tuesday night (Apr. 25, 2017) by sharing a naked photo to her 1.1 million Instagram followers. Posing by a doorway in a Miami hotel, the 45-year-old was seen wearing just a pair of heels as emojis covered up her nipples and vagina.  A post shared by Erika Jayne (@theprettymess) on Apr 25, 2017 at 7:35pm PDT  “Mikey made me do it … Miami nights,” she wrote alongside the sexy snap, referring to choreographer Mikey Minden in the captions. Knowing she would face criticism from trolls, Jayne added:  “1. This is my pre DWTS body.  2. I am not currently in Miami but am in NYC.  3. I posted this knowing most of you would be judgmental and couldn’t resist a chance to tear me down and I was right.  4. Go be offended at your own life.  5.

"Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have been romantically linked since the year 2009 when they met while filming 'The Last Song.' The couple only confirmed their relationship in the year 2010 when they made their red carpet debut at an Oscar event. However, according to reports, the couple has split up for the second time, and we are really hoping that the reports are not true. The couple has been through so much together, and it would be unfortunate if these reports end up being true.  As reported by RadarOnline, an insider shared, ""They’ve been hanging by a thread for months. Now they’re as good as broken up and there will be no wedding."" It is also believed that the 'Hannah Montana' star left the couple's Malibu house without her engagement ring. ""Miley’s been spending a lot more time at her parents’ house. She needs time to herself,"" the source continued.  The 'Wrecking Ball' singer had been under a lot of pressure lately because of the wedding planning work and is now beginning to rethink her commitment to the 'Hunger Games' actor. ""She’s accomplished a lot in her life, but there’s still a lot she wants to do — and Miley doesn’t want to have to answer to anybody, least of all a husband,"" the insider went on to add.  On the 17th of June, Miley and Liam were photographed looking extremely miserable during a family gathering with Miley's parents for Father's Day. Recently, the couple was seen in the parking lot of the 'Nobu' restaurant, and it was evident that she was not wearing her ring. An onlooker shared, ""Things were really tense between Miley and Liam. They looked like they wanted to be anywhere but with each other.""  According to reports, Cyrus seems to have gotten cold feet and is dragging them for quit some time time, and Liam is supposedly very fed up with her endless days. ""Liam’s over it. He wants kids and doesn’t want to keep putting it off. It’s ultimatum time for Liam and pals aren’t betting on Miley making the commitment he wants!"" the source added.  The pair initially decided to get engaged in the year 2012 but chose to call it off in the year 2013. In September 2013, Miley's representative confirmed that the engagement had been called off. Liam was seen making out with Mexican actress and singer Eiza Gonzalez.  A post shared by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Mar 4, 2018 at 8:36pm PST  In the month of December that same year, Miley revealed what life after her relationship with Liam Hemsworth looked like and said, ""This is the best time of my life. I'm not going to look back on it and be like, 'I wish I hadn't been dwelling over a breakup,' you know? Because that's not what God wants my life to be about right now."" Around three years later, the pair chose to get back and Miley was seen sporting her engagement ring.  On an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Miley revealed, ""It's very weird because this is, like, real jewelry, and most of my jewelry is made out of gummy bears and cotton candy. They don't look that good together because they kind of mix up."" Miley also went on to add, ""Sometimes I replace it with an actual unicorn or a Looney Tune, and he's kind of like, ""What's going on?"" And I'm like, ""This isn't really my aesthetic, but I'll wear it because you love me."" Miley said that her wedding ""has to be perfect"" and ""has to be like a soundtrack in a movie.""  Around the time when the couple announced their engagement, Miley spoke to People and shared, ""I'm so happy to be engaged and look forward to a life of happiness with Liam."" During the year 2017, Miley told the Sun that she does not have plans to get married any time soon and shared, ""I don't envision marriage. I'm 24. I hope I get to live a little bit more. I have too much living to do [before I get married].""  ""Three years ago, if you’d asked me if I’d be here, this happy with this man, I’d have been stunned. I’m just riding this out. In some relationships, you lose yourself by being with someone else. Actually, it made me find myself more. I have no idea what the next three years will bring, but if it’s possible to get even happier, I’ll take it,"" Miley added.  During the same interview, she also spoke about her relationship with Liam after they decided to split up.  A post shared by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on May 7, 2018 at 5:05pm PDT  ""I didn’t know [we’d get back together]. I’m so crazy I have no idea. But I had something in my heart, it never felt like it was really over. We kept a great friendship really private. It’s good for people to have that space to grow individually. Otherwise, when you’re with someone from 16 until 24, you grow into the same person,"" she revealed.  The couple attended the 'Thor: Ragnarok' premiere together to support Hemsworth's brother, Chris Hemsworth and the couple seemed like they were going strong and were in it for the long run. There were many rumors which stated that the couple had secretly decided to get married in April 2017 but Chris Hemsworth flatly denied the rumors during an interview with SiriusXM's Sway in the Morning in January of 2018."

As Us Weekly previously reported, the dance partners have not been seeing eye to eye, which was rumored to be the real reason behind Chmerkovskiy missing his Monday, October 2, performance. The Ukranian choreographer, 37, cited undisclosed “personal issues” for skipping the show, forcing Alan Bernsten to fill in for him.  He later apologized to the former Total Request Live cohost, 36, on Wednesday, October 4, with a tweet that said, “As you are all aware, I had to leave the show last week to take care of some personal issues. I take full responsibility for my absence and want to apologize to my partner Vanessa. We are both looking forward to dancing for our fans next week!”  As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the DWTS fan favorite and Lachey’s partnership was “not going well.”  A source told Us, “Their personalities are very similar so they disagree about everything. They refuse to give into one another,” before adding, “They’re playing nice for the cameras but both are miserable paired with each other — there is a lot of fighting going on behind the scenes.”  However, an insider exclusively told Us the pair will appear on the upcoming DWTS episode on Monday, October 9, saying, “They have already rehearsed this week.

"Three women filed a new class action lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein on Friday, including one who alleged that Weinstein raped her after she came to his office to pitch her internet startup.  The woman, Melissa Thompson, accuses Weinstein of luring her to his hotel room for a meeting in 2011 and then forcibly raping her.  “Thompson was fighting back, but could not out-muscle him,” the lawsuit states. “Thompson closed her eyes, traumatized, praying for the assault to end.”  Earlier that day, Thompson said that she went to Weinstein’s Tribeca office to pitch him on a marketing startup called Intercast Networks. According to the suit, she made a video recording of the encounter on her laptop. As she explained the company’s services, she alleges that Weinstein began to caress her legs. He promised to make a deal that afternoon if she would meet him for a drink at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, the suit alleges. Once there, he brought her to his hotel room, where the alleged rape occurred.  The complaint also alleges that Thompson sought help from the law firm of Benjamin Brafman last fall, and turned over her video evidence to the firm not realizing that Brafman was representing Weinstein.  Related Judge Refuses to Dismiss Harvey Weinstein Sexual Assault Case New York Attorneys Doubt That Weinstein Case Will Be Dismissed  A second woman, actress Caitlin Dulany, also alleged that Weinstein sexually assaulted her at the Hotel du Cap in Cannes in 1996. Dulany earlier told a version of her encounter in a first-person account for the Wrap, though she did not mention the alleged assault. In the suit, Dulany alleges that Weinstein performed oral sex on her without her consent and then masturbated.  The third plaintiff, actress Larissa Gomes, alleges that Weinstein cornered her in a hotel room in Toronto in 2000, tried to get her to give him a massage and asked to see her breast. She recoiled, and Weinstein became angry.  “You know Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd were exactly where you are at one point,” Gomes quotes him as saying. “Look at them now. Ashley Judd had no problem f—ing me.” (Judd and Paltrow have both alleged that Weinstein made unwanted advances toward them.)  According to Gomes, she tried to get away, saying “I think I should go now, my boyfriend is waiting for me, and he will be worried.”  Gomes alleges that Weinstein forcibly tried to kiss her, before she fled.  The women are represented by Hagens Berman and the Armenta Law Firm, which also filed an earlier class action suit against Weinstein on behalf of six other women. The suit names Miramax, the Walt Disney Co., and Weinstein as defendants, along with individual board members of the Weinstein Co.  Weinstein has consistently denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and criminal sexual acts in New York, and faces up to 25 years in prison on those charges.  His representative has yet to respond to the new allegations.

Horan gets photo credit for the tousled hair selfie that came next.  One Direction, formed on The X Factor in 2010, went on hiatus in 2016 shortly after founding member Zayn Malik left the group to pursue his own solo career.  And Payne and Horan’s solo careers are off to their own impressive start.  Source: Niall Horan/Instagram  Source: Liam Payne/Instagram  Horan’s debut album arrives in the fall, following hit singles “This Town” and “Slow Hands.” Meanwhile, Payne has released his own debut single, a hip-hop inspired pop track called “Strip That Down,” as well as welcomed his first son, Bear, in March.  Despite separate professional paths, the bandmates still rallied around Harry Styles after he lost his stepfather Robin Twist this week.  “Devastated to hear the news about Robin. He was such a lovely, kind and funny guy. Sending all my love to the whole family,” Louis Tomlinson, who lost his own mother late last year, tweeted. “You’ll be missed mate.” Added Payne, “Harry my heart really goes out to you – such an extremely sad day for us all who knew Robin. What a kind, gentle and beautiful soul, a true rarity to find in today’s world. Sometimes they really do take the best of us far too soon.”  FROM PEN: Hear Why TI Decided To Bring His Hit Reality Show To an End  “Very sad to hear about the loss of Robin,” Horan wrote. “For those who had the pleasure of knowing Robin will know that he was the nicest, kindest, most generous , hilariously funny guy you’ll have met. He always had a smile on his face even when he was battling the terrible illness. Love ya H. Please give your mum and the rest of the family a massive hug from my family.”"

"Ivanka Trump is getting some extra notice lately.  Well, more accurately, Trump's eyes are getting some extra notice lately.  As she makes more and more public appearances in her new official role in the White House, people are looking closely and realizing Trump's eyes may not be what they appear.  REUTERS  As it turns out, if you stare deeply into Trump's eyes, you'll notice they change repeatedly over time.  At various different public appearances, Trump's eyes are different colors. Naturally, her eyes -- like her hair -- are brown.  REUTERS  But sometimes, she changes it up. Her eyes have appeared a lighter hazel, green and even blue at various points over time, including during the 2016 presidential election.  Check out the changes for yourself:  REUTERS  REUTERS  REUTERS  REUTERS  REUTERS  As you can see, Trump's eyes are a revolution over time.  There doesn't appear to be an exact method to the eye-color-changing madness.  Her eyes were brown when she stared at Justin Trudeau.  REUTERS  But they were green when she had a controversial interview with Gayle King on CBS.  This eye color phenomenon has been noticed at least as far back as early November, when Esquire questioned Trump's eye color.  Then, press representatives did not respond to Esquire's request for comment on if she wears color-changing contacts, so we just have to go off common sense and say that's what's happening (it's more likely than her eyes spontaneously changing color on opposite sides of the genetic spectrum).  Although some women have said their eyes changed colors over the course of pregnancy -- and Trump was pregnant last year -- that doesn't explain why the color hopped around so much.  Maybe she likes the way it looks and it gives her confidence. Maybe she wants to give off a lighter tone to be more likable (see: all the Disney characters with blue eyes), which, yeah, is a racial thing.  And if you really want to go down the conspiracy theory rabbit hole (and I know you do), you could consider the implications of making oneself blonde and blue-eyed. Like what Nazis like.  As this news continues to be reported, many people are wondering why.  Twitter  Twitter  There is certainly a lot going on in the Trump world. But you clicked here, didn't you?

"In January, I taped a three-by-five card next to my workstation at home and wrote “Best Shows” at the top of it, like I do every January. Whenever I saw a show that I really liked, I’d add the title to the card. In 1997, the first year in which I wrote about TV full time, I had ten titles on the card by Thanksgiving. A decade later, I’d routinely find myself culling a list of 15 titles when list-making time arrived. By the end of 2016, there were 20 titles on the card. This year, there were 23 strong contenders with another dozen possibles. That’s a reflection not just of how many shows are in production, but also how diverse they are in terms of style, structure, subject matter, and worldview.  number 10  The Carmichael Show (NBC)  Jerrod Carmichael’s old-school, social-issues-driven, three-camera-plus-a-live-audience sitcom is one of many quirky outliers to get canceled this year just when it was really getting warmed up. Too bad: This latest batch of episodes could’ve gone toe-to-toe with the best installments of Norman Lear’s Good Times. Many of the episodes, including the one built around David Alan Grier’s character’s confrontation with his mother’s mortality, were ripped directly from the actors’ own lives.  number 9  Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (The CW)  Rachel Bloom and Aline Brosh-McKenna’s musical-psychological comedy-drama continues to take risks. The back half of season two and the first half of season three were stunning.  number 8  Samurai Jack (Adult Swim)  Genndy Tartakovsky caps his series about a stoic samurai’s pursuit of a demon with his career-best work as an animator.  number 7  The Young Pope (HBO)  Of all the current TV series that owe an obvious debt to David Lynch, this quirky yet often visionary religious drama from Paolo Sorrentino is the most original. The deadpan humor sometimes obscured the fact that, when the show talked about spirituality, it wasn’t kidding. The season finale has a cosmic sense of wonder.  number 6  The Deuce (HBO)  From The Wire collaborators George Pelecanos and David Simon comes a worthy successor, a period piece about the sex trade in 1970s Times Square that doubles as a corrosive satire on capitalism.  number 5  BoJack Horseman (Netflix)  The fourth season of Raphael Bob-Waksberg’s animated comedy-drama was a series of perfectly executed tales of confrontation, denial, selfishness, and healing.  number 4  The Get Down (Netflix)  Baz Luhrmann and Stephen Adly Guirgis’s musical drama about the birth of hip-hop starts in 1977, set just a few years after another great New York drama, Mad Men, ended. Demographically, narratively, and stylistically, it’s a worthy companion piece, one of a handful of series that can be said to have devised its own language.  number 3  Better Things (FX)  Pamela Adlon’s series about single motherhood took more stylistic and tonal risks than last year, and they all paid off. Anyone who’s been a parent or a child will appreciate the truths this show contains.  number 2  The Leftovers (HBO)  Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta’s post-Rapture drama finished its three-year run with eight episodes of alternately wrenching, surreal, and bleakly funny storytelling about the psychological aftermath of loss and the quest to superimpose narrative on a seemingly chaotic world. I should admit this pick comes with an asterisk: Lindelof told me that certain themes and images, and the totality of episode five, were inspired by my personal writing about the death of my first wife. I loved the season before I knew that, so I’m leaving The Leftovers where I think it would’ve gone otherwise; however, if you consider the personal aspect disqualifying, go ahead and bump The Leftovers off the list and move everything up a notch. (In that case, AMC’s Better Call Saul would land at No. 10.)  number 1  Twin Peaks: The Return (Showtime)  A weekly mind-effing event the likes of which hasn’t been seen since the first year of Lost. This 18-hour series from Twin Peaks co-creators David Lynch and Mark Frost wasn’t a straightforward continuation of the story, but something more like a series of variations or improvisations on familiar characters and situations. It took a while to grasp that it was a largely non-narrative experience, conceived in terms of light and shadow, rhythm and visual rhyme, color and music (most hours ended with a full-length musical performance). Episode eight, which reconceived the postwar history of the United States in mythological terms starting with the first atom bomb test, is a masterpiece; at least five other episodes are nearly as good.  *A version of this article appears in the December 11, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."
"According to Star, when Angelina Jolie left Brad’s life, party-loving George was excited to return, having allegedly been shunted out of the actor’s life by a disapproving Ange. And he reportedly relished the opportunity to facilitate a thawing between Brad and his ex-wife Jen.  ‘They’ve been secretly getting together for late night hook ups, and it’s all because of George,’ a source told Star.  ‘George was the first person to call him when his marriage to Angie imploded. After Jen and Justin Theroux announced their split, he encouraged Brad to reach out and give their relationship another chance.’  The magazine cover that all of America is talking about today Star magazine  According to the magazine, the duo had their first post-slip meet up an March 3 at a private pre-Oscars party in Beverly Hills.  ‘The plan was to head over to Jen’s place afterward for a nightcap, but, of course, George would just drop Brad off.’  The magazine claims that Jen was so excited by the idea, that she even went to the extreme of lending George her bodyguard so he could drive the pair to her home.  ‘Their evening together was very relaxed and low-key,’ the source told Star. ‘They reminisced about the past and had a lot of laughs. It seems just like old times, only better.’  While Star notes that George Clooney’s rep had denied their story, the magazine goes on to note that Jennifer ‘wants to keep the reunion under the radar’, given that she only announced her marriage split weeks ago.  Neither Brad nor Jen’s reps have yet commented on Star’s story."
"She just gave birth 3 months ago.  Is Khloe Kardashian pregnant again? We all know that she has always wanted to be a mother. She’s talked about it candidly on Keeping up with the Kardashians, and has frequently expressed her desire to have a family of her own. After many years of trying, Khloe finally gave birth to her daughter, True, in April.  Around the time of True’s birth, Khloe’s boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, found himself at the center of a cheating scandal in which a video was released with him kissing and groping another woman. There were also salacious text messages he sent to his mistress. Would you really expect anything different from someone who cheated on his then-pregnant girlfriend to be with a Kardashian? Once a cheater, always a cheater?  A post shared by @krazyinlovewithkardashians on Aug 8, 2017 at 2:43pm PDT  It’s safe to assume Khloe wants more children in the future, but does that mean she’s been trying again with Tristan?  A source has said, “Khloe loved being pregnant, but she’s the first to say how great she feels now that she’s lost the baby weight. That being said, she could find herself pregnant again soon.”  Even so, the two recently took a trip to Mexico together, and according to the source, “they’ve been having tons of wild sex, especially on their trip to Mexico. It’s basically been like a mini honeymoon for them.”  The source also claims that Tristan wants more children as well and can be very persuasive. “He’s been saying that since they first fell in love he can see them having five or even six kids. That hasn’t changed; he loves being a dad and is even more in love with Khloe now that they have True. Khloe says she’s not ready to be pregnant again yet, but Tristan‘s a convincing guy,” the source revealed.  Is that enough to convince Khloe to try to get pregnant again? After giving birth, women have to wait six weeks before they can have sex again and the couple is well past that date.  But don’t get too excite because Khloe herself revealed that she’s not quite ready. A fan recently asked if she was having another baby:  Not right now lol True is only 3 months old so give me some time lol https://t.co/TthrxOQdHr — Khloé (@khloekardashian) July 28, 2018  Keep in mind that she just went back to work, and is in the process of fixing her relationship with Tristan. Would she really be in the right state of mind to welcome another child into the world?  While she may wait a while, there’s no doubt that she loves being a mom. We just hope she gets her house in order before expanding her family any further.  A post shared by Top Media New Zealand.

"If Bachelor Nation couples take nothing else away from going through the experience of being on The Bachelor or The Bachelorette, then maybe they can just appreciate the gift of amazing engagement rings that are of no cost to them or their partners. For years, Neil Lane has been the prime source for the franchise’s engagement rings and that doesn’t seem to be changing anytime soon. So, how much was Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette?  ABC spared no expense for true love and for Season 13, it was the same deal, even though it’s not confirmed if Neil Lane gifts the show with his rings for the publicity or if ABC busts out some hefty petty cash for them each season. Despite Rachel preferring a plain wedding band over a big old rock, she described another version of her dream ring and Bryan was able to pick one out from Lane’s selection, as per usual. And, like always, it didn’t come cheap.  According to E! News, Rachel's three-carat pear-shaped diamond ring cost more than $100,000, making it one of the more expensive engagement rings in Bachelor Nation history.  Luckily, the suitors are never expected to foot the bill for the engagement rings, which is probably a good thing since in the past, they’ve cost a pretty penny. During Season 17 of The Bachelor, Sean Lowe gave Catherine Giudici an engagement ring that was more than three carats and retails for around $75,000. Season 19’s Chris Soules proposed to Whitney Bischoff with a 4-carat Neil Lane ring that reportedly cost $92,000.  Although The Bachelorette engagement rings are pretty much the cream of the crop, they’re also, for all intents and purposes, on loan to contestants. For all rings in Bachelor Nation, unless purchased by one of the contestants personally and not received through the Neil Lane arrangement, it’s in the contestants’ contracts that they must remain in their relationship for two years or they forfeit the ring back to ABC. If they’re lucky enough to last as a couple outside of The Bachelorette and Bachelor bubble, then they get to keep their Neil Lane bling and live happily ever after in wedded Bachelor Nation bliss.  Even though some of The Bachelorette contestants this season were doctors and lawyers, who’s going to turn down the allure of a free and clear Neil Lane diamond, right? Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette is blingy for sure, but without being flashy or too over the top and I’d expect nothing less from someone who is already a Bachelorette favorite for so many fans. So at least in that respect, Bryan’s off to a good start as her future husband."

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  The actress Prince Harry looks set to pop the question to could not be more suited, say pals - because her student days were perfect training to keep up with the playboy prince.  While 36-year-old Meghan Markle may seem like the ideal princess-in-waiting, we can reveal she had a wild youth just like 32-year-old Harry.  Meghan’s days at Northwestern University in Chicago in the early 2000s have rarely been spoken about.  But a visit to her old stomping ground by the Sunday Mirror has revealed she was a typical party-loving student who allegedly used fake ID to go clubbing.  One of her favourite haunts is said to have been a bar that has since been shut down following a battle with authorities over underage drinking.  We also uncovered an article from the college news magazine in which Meghan herself joked she put on a stone after bingeing on Burger King in her Freshman year.  Interviewed by the magazine in 2014, after returning to the Northwestern campus for a Q&A session alongside fellow cast members of TV show Suits, she said: “It’s surreal because I haven’t been back since I graduated.  “And as I’m walking around I remember things like the schlep of getting to South Campus from up north.  “The 24-hour Burger King also ­definitely helped me put on the Freshman Fifteen.”  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  Meghan attended the university’s School of Communication at the same time as fun-loving Prince Harry was getting into trouble for heavy drinking.  In his late teens, the young prince was making headlines for his wild nights out in Gloucestershire pubs around Highgrove – Prince Charles’s country home.  One pub in particular, the Rattlebone Inn, which has since changed hands, was infamous for its boozy lock-ins.  Prince Harry even set up a nightclub for his posh friends in the basement of Highgrove, calling it Club H.  And while the prince partied with his exclusive group of pals, Meghan was at college mixing with members of her own posh pack.  Hers was an all-female society, called the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, with a reputation for hard partying and social climbing.  Current KKG member Melania Hidalgo told the Sunday Mirror that Meghan had been a popular member of the student body.  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  She said: “We’re intelligent hot messes. The thing we all have in common is that we’re all very driven, ambitious and passionate.  “Meghan was the recruitment chair of the sorority during her time here.  “She was in charge of bringing in new girls – you have to be a very friendly and outgoing person for that role.  “I lived in the house for a year and it’s a very fun experience, you end up becoming friends with people you never thought you’d mix with.  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  “All of the late nights, and coming home from going out, watching movies… you develop very strong friendships.”  Meghan is not the only famous actor to have graduated from Northwestern. David Schwimmer, Warren Beatty, Stephen Colbert, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Zach Braff also learned their trade at the school.  Former pals told how Meghan had her eyes firmly set on Hollywood even back then – and would often sneak off for secret auditions for TV commercials.  Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now  But she still found time to let her hair down in the Windy City. One former student claimed: “Meghan had a fake ID during her time at university and told us about it when she visited the campus in 2014. She said she used it to drink at The Keg, which was a popular student bar for years, and she also got a job at a club in the city.  “You can get two fake IDs for about $100 in Chicago – it’s a little bit sketchy though and not everyone has one.  (Image: GC)  “She seems like the perfect modern princess now, but she lived university life like most teenagers and was really popular on campus. Everyone talks about her going here.” The Keg of Evanston later lost its liquor licence – after 36 years as a students’ favourite – following a battle with city officials over underage drinking.  It is now a trendy bar and restaurant, Bangers and Lace, and new management say The Keg will not be missed.  “It was a sh**hole, full of underage girls drinking and crazy boys starting fights,” general manager Chris Nora said. “It doesn’t surprise me Meghan had a fake ID.  (Image: WireImage)  Door staff used to joke when girls finally handed over a real one, saying, ‘It’s about time!’”  Already an accepted part of the family, Meghan is in the UK this week to give Prince Harry much-needed support on the 20th anniversary of mum Diana’s death . She spent the anniversary behind closed doors at Kensington Palace, sharing the difficult time with Harry and his brother William, along with William’s wife Kate and Harry’s nephew and niece, George, four, and Charlotte, two.  Our trip to Northwestern also shed some light on the mystery surrounding Meghan’s birth name, Rachel. For while the world knows her as Meghan, that is actually her middle name.  Rachel is the name given by her parents Thomas and Doria.  And photos discovered in the KKG house on campus show one picture of the actress captioned “Rachel Markle” – and another captioned “Meghan Markle”.  The find suggests it was during her college years that she switched her names.  And as speculation grows that the world’s most eligible bachelor could be about to pop the question, Meghan Markle is the name that will soon be known in every corner of the globe."
"Rob Kardashian took to Instagram last week to share his story of the messy split between himself and popular model/reality tv star Blac Chyna. He also revealed some secrets and explicit photos of the model online.  ABC’s Nightline aired an interview with the model and she explained how she felt when her estranged partner shared her nude pictures on Instagram.  “I was devastated. I’m looking at this and I’m like, ‘How could someone do this to me?'” she confessed. “I was very fearful because I was like, ‘If you could do this, what else could you do?'”  Chyna stood up for herself saying that her past as a stripper is irrelevant. “Just because of something that I used to do, I shouldn’t be bullied to say, ‘OK, well, you used to do this, so you deserve that,”.  “Just because of something that I used to do, I shouldn’t be bullied to say, ‘OK, well, you used to do this, so you deserve that,” She told Good Morning America.  When she sent the photos to Rob, she did not consent to him posting or sharing for others to see. “The moral of the story is, like, he doesn’t respect me,” she said. “So if you can’t respect me, you have to respect the law.” In the interview, Chyna also repeated new claims of Rob being physically violent with her and making multiple suicide threats over the past few months. “Rob has hit me before. Yes, this was in April.”He threatened to kill himself multiple times in text messages since we broke up in December 2016, trying to manipulate me to respond to his outbursts. I have been telling Rob to get help and go to therapy since June 2016. To my knowledge, Rob has not seen a licensed therapist.”I am in fear of this angry, volatile, vindictive man, who has physically attacked me and tried to humiliate me so publicly. I am embarrassed by his posts. I ask for orders of protection so that I can live my life in peace and free of fear of him.” After the interview was recorded, Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order against Rob. Another court date has been scheduled for August.In spite of the troubles, Chyna hoped to work things out with Rob for the sake of their 8-month old daughter Dream Kardashian."
"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will be staying in town after their May 19 wedding.  The pair will not jet off for their romantic honeymoon right after saying ""I do,"" Kensington Palace confirmed in a press briefing on Friday.  “The couple will be going on honeymoon, but not straightaway,” Kensington Palace spokesman Jason Knauf said. “They will have their first engagement as a married couple in the week after the wedding.”  Meghan Markle Spotted Getting in Shape for Her Royal Wedding  When they do get a chance to get away, Meghan and Harry are expected to honeymoon in Namibia -- a place where they'll find plenty of privacy, as it's one of the least densely populated countries in the world. Travel + Leisure magazine reported last month that the twosome will stay at Namibia's newest luxury camp, Natural Selection's Hoanib Valley Camp.  Harry and Meghan have spent time together in Africa before. In the couple's first joint interview with BBC News after announcing their engagement last November, Harry revealed he and Meghan went camping together in Botswana early in their courtship, solidifying their relationship.  Why Meghan Markle Won't Have a Maid of Honor for Her Royal Wedding With Prince Harry  ""We met once and then twice, back-to-back, two dates in London, last July,"" Harry said. ""I think about three, maybe four weeks later, I managed to persuade her to come join me in Botswana and we camped out with each other under the stars. We spent five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic. Then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure we had a chance to get to know each other.""

"Angelina Jolie has not been enjoying very pleasant headlines lately — not since her divorce and custody battle with Brad Pitt took a dark turn earlier this month.  In the headlines, Jolie has stopped being the serene mother of six, glamorous movie star or compassionate United Nations High Commissioners for Refugees special envoy.  More and more, the 43-year-old Jolie has been accused of being the “crazy and manipulative” estranged wife who has become increasingly “unpopular in Hollywood.” She’s “out for blood” in the divorce fight, or she “wants to embarrass and punish” the seemingly affable Pitt by portraying him in court papers as a deadbeat dad, or by apparently trying to undercut his relationship with their children, as suggested by a family law judge.  Also damning: Page Six reported last week that Jolie had developed “an insane jealousy” jealous of Amal Clooney, the international human rights attorney and wife of George Clooney. Jolie believes “Amal has stolen her identity” as the world’s most glamorous, admired humanitarian, a source told Page Six.  But breaking through all these negative headlines Tuesday was a reminder from Jolie herself of her world-class humanitarian credentials. She published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency’s efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children.  The timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given headlines this week about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.  But as Jolie noted, she wrote her piece to advance important news: The UNHRC is about to publish a report in which the UN agency warns about the rising numbers of refugee children who are not receiving an education.  In any case, Jolie brought her cinematic story-telling experience to share moving accounts of what education means to children — girls especially — whose lives and communities have been upended by the ongoing Syrian civil war.  Jolie said she had met these girls herself during her goodwill trips to refugee camps in the war-torn region. She described one girl who had given up her dream of going to school and becoming a doctor after her mother was killed in an airstrike and she was forced to take care of her five younger siblings, Jolie said. With no other choice, the girl married at 14, can’t read or write and has been “robbed of her childhood and the future she might have had.”  The other girl was able to go to a local high school while living in a barren Iraqi refugee camp, and is now studying dentistry at a local Iraqi university — while still living with her parents in the camp, Jolie said.  “There are millions of young refugees with the energy and desire and commitment to study and work, who want to contribute to the societies that host them and ultimately help rebuild their home countries,” Jolie wrote. “There are millions of displaced parents who will make every sacrifice imaginable to help their children go to school.”  Jolie then argues how wealthier countries can help less fortunate countries rebuild after war: “Not with peace agreements and resolutions, as necessary as those are, but with millions of school report cards, exams passed, qualifications obtained, jobs acquired, and young lives turned to good purpose rather than spent languishing in camps.”  Jolie said she understands how overwhelming these refugee crises can seem to the outside world.  “Hardly a day goes past without bleak news headlines about violence, suffering and the displacement of people, from Afghanistan to Yemen,” Jolie wrote. “It is difficult to find a single example of where we are succeeding as an international community in ending conflicts and securing peace.”  But Jolie said there is an answer in helping refugees in a “patient, long-term manner, guided by our values.” She concluded her piece by writing: “If we help refugees get an education, they themselves will take on the harder task of rebuilding the countries whose future peace and security is so important to our own. It is the wise as well as morally right course of action.”"
"Teresa Giudice isn’t looking to have another day in court. Following fan speculation that the Real Housewives of New Jersey star, 45, was planning to split from husband Joe Giudice after she posted an Instagram photo with a divorce attorney, Teresa clarified that she was simply at dinner with a friend.  As previously reported, Teresa posted a photo to Instagram on Saturday, January 6, posing with New Jersey attorney Loren La Forge-Kyriakoulis. The reality star originally captioned the photo, “Dinner with a great friend getting great advice” before quickly changing it to “Dinner with a great friend lots of laughs” with the hashtag “#webothlovefood.”  During Teresa’s Wednesday, January 10, appearance with sister-in-law Melissa Gorga on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, a fan called in to ask Teresa if the photo indicated she and Joe were on the rocks, which Teresa vehemently denied. “I was helping her. Just in case – If anybody’s getting divorced, she’s a great divorce attorney to call,” she explained. “Get it? I was helping her.”  Gorga, 38, chimed in, “Oh, you’re saying you were publicizing her,” to which Teresa said, “Yes! Capisce? Capisce.”  “What’s the matter with two women sitting together and shooting the breeze,” Teresa continued. “Talking about growing up?”  Gorga, who happened to be at the same restaurant that night, also recalled her initial confusion when she approached the pair at dinner to say hello. “I was like, ‘Who are you?’ and she was like, ‘I’m so and so’ and Teresa’s like, ‘She’s a divorce attorney,’ and I’m like, ‘Huh?’”  During the interview, Teresa also opened up about the months-long period that she didn’t visit her husband, who is currently serving time for conspiracy and bankruptcy fraud. “My mom got sick, so I didn’t see him the whole time my mom was sick, those three months,” she said. “I remember the one day I was going to see him, that’s when my dad got sick, and then I had to turn around and go back.”  “Then there was a chicken pox breakout there, in the prison, so we weren’t allowed to go see him,” she continued. “Oh, and then they found contraband from other inmates!”  However, Teresa, who also served 11 months in prison in 2015 for fraud, isn’t exactly eager to return to jail – even to visit Joe. “You know, I don’t really enjoy going there,” she said. “Even when I was [in prison], I was like, ‘Don’t come!'”  The couple has been plagued by divorce rumors in recent months, however two after before Teresa posted the photo with Forge-Kyriakoulis, the television personality’s attorney James Leonard Jr. shut down the speculation. “I don’t know how to say it any louder or plainer, but it ain’t happening. Period,” Leonard told Us Weekly exclusively. “Why can’t people accept the fact that these two people simply want to stay married to one another and let them live their lives?”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!"

"If you were left thinking, 'I've seen that face before' when Netflix hit Stranger Things first catapulted teen star Millie Bobby Brown to stardom - you weren't alone.  In fact, the now-13-year-old's near-identical resemblance to a fellow on-screen starlet is now the source of much hype on social media, with thousands of people taking to Twitter and Instagram to highlight the uncanny similarities between Millie and 36-year-old actress Natalie Portman.  And it's not just the simple similarities in terms of facial features like their noses, mouths, and dimples, that has people talking; interestingly both women have had shaved heads for previous roles, and both have modeled similar red carpet looks - making the resemblance between them all the more remarkable.  Twins: Millie Bobby Brown is a doppelganger of Natalie Portman and the similarities are shocking, like this photo of Millie in Stranger Things (left) and Natalie in V for Vendetta (right)  Crazy: Millie, 13, (left) at Netflix's Stranger Things Season 2 premiere on October 26, 2017 and Natalie, 36, (right) at the Flirting With Disaster premiere on March 21, 1996  ‹ Slide me › Spot the difference: Everything from the shape of the actress's faces to the way that they have been styled for previous roles are similar. Millie is pictured left, and Natalie right  While this is by no means the first time two celebrities have been compared in terms of their similar looks, this is arguably the most impressive, with a series of side-by-side images revealing just how alike Millie and Natalie are.  In particular, pictures of the two with shaved heads - Millie for her ongoing role as Eleven in Stranger Things, and Natalie for her part in 2006 thriller V for Vendetta - have social media users convinced that the duo must be related in one way or another.  Although Natalie did not shave her head to play Evey Hammond until she was 25, while Millie has been modeling the style on and off since she began filming for Netflix at age 12, the pair almost indistinguishable - despite the 13-year age gap between them.  Many of the comparative images being shared on social media have actually left some users unable to tell which actress is which, while others have been prompted to demand 'answers' about how their similarities have only just come to light.  'Are Natalie Portman and Millie Bobby Brown related? I need answers!' one person wrote on Twitter, while share a series of lookalike images of the two.  Bald: The similarities between Millie (left) and Natalie are all the more obvious to see when images of them both with shaved heads are placed side by side  Hair: Millie attended the 75th Annual Golden Globes on January 7, 2018 and had the same exact slicked back hairstyle that Natalie rocked on a red carpet in January 1990  Scary: Both girls had to shave their heads for roles, as Millie plays Eleven in Stranger Things and Natalie played Evey Hammond in V for Vendetta in 2006  Shocking: One Twitter user shared a photo she edited where she morphed both Millie and Natalie's faces together and you cannot even tell who is who  'Well, clearly Millie needs to play Natalie's daughter at some point. Make it happen, Hollywood,' another person pointed out, noting that someone may as well capitalize on the incredible physical similarities between two such talented stars.  Another person chimed in that the process of being compared to another Hollywood star has landed Millie a spot among a group of incredibly successful actresses.  'Millie can join the pack of Winona Ryder, Natalie Portman, and Kiera Knightley of looking the exact same,' the Twitter user wrote.  Others were convinced that there was something a bit more sinister at play - perhaps those who are fans of Millie's sci-fi series which focuses on such eerie goings on.,  'I need a conspiracy video on this,' one person joked, while another insisted: 'She's actually a Natalie Portman clone created to grace us with more Natalie Portman.'  Identical: In another comparison tweet, someone pointed out how much Millie looks like the character Natalie played in Beautiful Girls back in 1996  Can you tell the difference? Not only are their eyes and noses the same, they both have the same exact mouth and dimples  Happy: Millie has tried similar hairstyles to Natalie, like these slicked back buns on the Tonight Show on October 31, 2017 and Natalie’s at an award show on November, 14 2003"
"Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have split after two and a half years of marriage — and seven years as a couple.  “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,” says a statement released by longtime Aniston publicist Stephen Huvane. “This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.  “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another. ”  The couple announced that they split at the end of the last year, however, they celebrated the New Year together with their annual vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico alongside a handful of close pals including Jason Bateman and his family.  Pharrell and Jennifer Aniston at Ellen DeGeneres' birthday.  The two spent quite a bit of time apart in recent months raising questions. Theroux was often spotted in New York City away from their L.A. home. They have also had a busy year as Aniston signed on with Reese Witherspoon for a new Apple TV series and filmed Dumplin’ in Atlanta, while Theroux, 46, filmed the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me in Budapest.  On Saturday, Aniston made an appearance at Ellen DeGeneres‘ birthday party without Theroux. She was spotted standing outside the Hollywood venue chatting with Pharrell.  The next day, the actress rang in her 49th birthday without the actor. Aniston celebrated in Malibu, California with a gathering including pals Courteney Cox, Andrea Bendewald, Leigh Kilton-Smith and Kristin Hahn on Sunday.  Theroux, meanwhile, was spotted out in New York City on Friday walking his dog. (Last year, the duo vacationed together in Los Cabos, Mexico with friends).  Justin Theroux walks his dog in N.Y.C. days before Jennifer Aniston's birthday. Splash News Online  Sources recently told PEOPLE that their busy schedules worked for both of them and helped their marriage.  “Justin often spends a few days in NYC by himself,” a source previously told PEOPLE. “When he is in NYC, Jen will catch up with friends and enjoys her own life. When Justin is in L.A., it’s very special for them. They socialize together with friends. They often go out to dinner or have people over.”  Aniston showed off the $21 million L.A. home they designed together in the March issue of Architectural Digest, saying, “I look around at my husband and my dogs and our home, and there’s nowhere else I want to be.”  Aniston and Theroux first met on the Hawaii set of 2008’s Tropic Thunder and began dating in 2011. They later married in a surprise and secret ceremony on August 5, 2015 — just a few days before Theroux’s 44th birthday. A source close to the actress told PEOPLE at the time that the two were happy to have pulled off the surprise wedding, inviting friends to a backyard party under the ruse of celebrating Theroux’s birthday.  RELATED: Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux Were the Picture Perfect Couple During Their Last Vacation  “They seemed ecstatic,” the source said. “They celebrated late and barely slept, but they were in the best mood. They were giddy to have pulled off an amazing wedding celebration with their friends. And they were proud to finally be married.”  Aniston was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005 after starting their relationship in 1998. She later dated Vince Vaughn and John Mayer after her divorce from Pitt.  This is Theroux’s first marriage after previously dating hair stylist Heidi Bivens for 14 years before their breakup in 2011, shortly before he started dating Aniston. Theroux and Bivens shared an apartment in New York City before the split."

"Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has backed out as a performer at next week's presidential inaugural, saying she did not realize that her participation would be interpreted as a statement of support for President-elect Donald Trump.  Jennifer Holliday is backing out of performing at Trump's inauguration celebration after receiving backlash from her fans. Kareem Quow for KQ Photography  Holliday, best known for her Tony-winning role in Broadway's ""Dreamgirls,"" faced pressure from her gay, lesbian and black fans when it was announced she would sing at a Thursday concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial.  Holliday said in a statement Saturday that she apologized for her lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues and causing heartbreak for her fans.  Several prominent entertainers have declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities. Country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are in the lineup for Thursday's concert.  Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans. Her representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press.  ""My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!"" she wrote.  ""Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you,"" she added. ""You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded.""  Related: Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down to Play Inauguration-Related Event  In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Holliday defended her decision to perform at the inauguration.  ""I didn't see it as singing for Trump; I saw it as singing for the people on the mall,"" Holliday told the AP.  The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in ""The Color Purple,"" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her ""Uncle Tom"" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life.  ""It just really made my heart drop to my feet,"" Holliday said. ""How could I have this much hate spewing at me, and I haven't even done anything? I guess it's not like those old days when political views were your own and you had freedom of speech. ... We live in a different time now, and a decision to go and do something for America is not so clear-cut anymore.""  Holliday was to perform at the ""Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration"" which included Keith, Voight, and Trump himself.  The celebrity wattage for Trump's inaugural festivities doesn't rival that of Barack Obama's inaugurations, which attracted top names including Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Eva Longoria and Jennifer Hudson, among others. But Trump has insisted that's how he wants it, saying the swearing-in festivities should be about the people, not the A-list stars."

"© Matt Baron/REX/Shutterstock Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt attend their ""By the Sea"" film premiere in Los Angeles on Nov. 5, 2015.  It's been nearly two years since Angelina Jolie left Brad Pitt and took their six kids with her in September 2016. But even after all this time, they have yet to finalize a divorce and custody agreement.  That's apparently now causing problems for the star, who allegedly wants to take their children -- Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9 -- with her to London where she'll film Disney's ""Maleficent 2"" this summer. Brad is based in Los Angeles, where Angelina also bought a home in 2017.  In a May 23 report, Page Six writes that Hollywood sources familiar with her film have revealed Angelina, 42, ""is furious since she wants to bring the couple's brood with her while the film shoots."" The implication is that her current custody arrangement with Brad -- the terms of which have remained confidential -- doesn't allow her to do that at will.  ""They are figuring out how it would work, but she is not happy,"" a source told Page Six. ""She wants to take the kids to London with her while she's shooting -- and she's frustrated with the process. They're talking about how it would work.""  Angelina is so livid about the whole situation, the source added, ""Even the people around her are getting tired of it.""  © Matt Baron/REX/Shutterstock Angelina Jolie attends the Critics' Choice Awards in Los Angeles on Jan. 11, 2018.  The report came hours after Us Weekly published a story claiming that Brad, 54, planned his summer work schedule in such a way that he could ensure he'd have time to spend with his six kids.  ""He chose a project that films in Los Angeles,"" an insider said in the new issue of Us Weekly. (Brad is starring alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in Quentin Tarantino's upcoming ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."") Brad made sure he has a flexible schedule that will help in his divorce settlement with Angelina, the insider explains, adding, ""Brad wants certain provisions in a custody agreement that guarantee custodial time with all six kids.""  © John Salangsang/Variety/REX/Shutterstock Brad Pitt attends the Cadillac Oscar Celebration in Los Angeles on March 1, 2018.  Another source told Us that Angelina ""has been very hesitant to agree to Brad's terms because she does resent him for essentially forcing her to settle down in Los Angeles with the kids"" after years of traveling the globe with them.

"Justin Bieber’s struggling with his split from Selena Gomez as she’s all smiles on her Australian vacation, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports."
"Lest the Kardashians have pulled the greatest troll job on celebrity media since that time Joaquin Phoenix pretended to be a rapper, its safe to assume that Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are both pregnant , and have been for some time. Yet, the close-knit clan has stubbornly refused to confirm this. Like most open secrets, it's become almost frustrating. More frustrating than those two friends in your circle that everyone knows are secretly dating but refuse to admit it. More frustrating than knowing someone is throwing you a surprise birthday party but not knowing the exact details. More frustrating even than when someone you know keeps saying they're staying out of politics, but occasionally makes vague Facebook status that makes you think they're a secret Trump supporter. Yes, more frustrating than even that.  In the process, though, the Kardashian-Jenners have turned the presumably inevitable announcement and their surrounding anticipation into events on their own. It's not even a question of ""if"" that's interesting anymore, but rather ""how"" and ""when.... no seriously when? We're all waiting. There's a lot going on in the world right now. We have better things to think about.""  Well, at least one confirmation may be coming our way sometime sort of soon, if the latest preview of Keeping Up With The Kardashians is any indication. The trailer begins with Kris Jenner (in that blonde wig ) and her three eldest daughters sitting around a table and presumably all cosplaying as powerful female crime lords, as Kris proposes, ""Let's raise a glass to Kris f------ Jenner."" Then they run through matters of Rob's whole situation with Blac Chyna, Kendall's anxiety issues, and a tarantula before we get to someone murmuring the phrase, ""Did you guys hear what's on TMZ?"" Then Kourtney says, ""I'm so sick of people like not saying anything."" (Yeah, us too.) Eventually, though, we wind up at a party where there's tears of joy and everyone is hugging Khloe. It definitely seems like a pregnancy announcement situation.  So, perhaps that's how the Khloé konfirmation goes down, almost as we all should have expected it, during a super-hyped episode of the family's show.  That leaves the matter of Kylie, who, save for some iPhone-shot footage, is as conspicuously absent from the preview as the part of her body below her neck is from her Snapchats. Some fans have theories about how her pregnancy could be revealed. Kim is currently teasing the family's Christmas card shoot on Instagram in a sort of 25 day long digital advent calendar: Khloé made her first full appearance today, but Kylie has been missing. Might she and her baby bump appear on day 25? Or could she too be waiting to reveal her news on the show?  Here's another curious matter to consider when mulling the timing: the trailer in question is for the second half of this season, which will begin on January 7th next year. So we may make it through the rest of 2017 without confirmation of either. What's another few weeks at this point? Then again, what's the point of calling the show Keeping Up With The Kardashians if we're all way ahead of it anyway?  Either way, the've managed to keep attention on this mystery for far longer than they should have. As they say in the trailer, ""Let's raise a glass to Kris f------ Jenner!""

Photo credit: Mega  “It’s all very shady and ominous. Ellen went to great lengths to keep the news from their close friends to avoid being asked questions,” an insider claimed. “She and Portia were fighting more and more. Eventually, what normally would have been a routine back-and-forth turned nasty .” Photo credit: Mega  Ellen has publicly insisted the couple’s marriage is on solid ground. But sources have exclusively told The ENQUIRER the pair have been spending nights alone, and now they appear to be living completely apart. Photo credit: Mega  Property records show Ellen and Portia — who will be married for ten years on Aug. 16 — maintained two separate residences on the six-acre equestrian estate in exclusive Montecito, Calif., which recently sold for $11 million.

Photo credit: Mega  The talk-show host is a notorious house-flipper — investing in properties before cashing out when the real-estate market heats up.

Photo credit: Mega  “They spend less and less time together ,” said one source. “In fact, they’ve been living separate lives. It’s gotten so bad that they hardly say a word to each other all day.” Photo credit: Mega  “Portia feels neglected and mistreated,” another insider told The ENQUIRER. “She feels as if she supports Ellen in everything she does, while Ellen just gets aggravated and judgmental when it comes to her needs.” Photo credit: Mega  If they do announce a divorce, it promises to be one of the most expensive in Hollywood history! “With their combined fortune, future earnings and property totaling $400 million, it’ll be a good day to be their divorce lawyers!” claimed an insider. Photo credit: Mega  “The idea of going through that mess is probably the glue that’s kept them together this long!” A sour-faced Ellen was pictured without her wedding ring during a Beverly Hills shopping spree on April 20. At the time, talk heated up that her high-profile union was under pressure. Photo credit: Mega  But in the days that followed, she and Portia paraded their “happy” marriage in front of paparazzi at multiple Hollywood hot spots, usually arm in arm and sporting painful smiles. “Nobody is convinced,” a source said. “They aren’t intimate!” Photo credit: Mega  While a friend of Ellen’s brushed off talk of divorce, the couple’s marriage has exploded many times before, according to inside sources. But The ENQUIRER’s mole fears the worst as Portia continues to spend days alone at her own $17.3 million bolt-hole in Beverly Hills. Photo credit: Mega  “It’s usually Portia who walks out whenever they fight,” the insider claimed. “Ellen has a great TV personality, but at home she’s a bore who goes to bed every night at nine.” “Arrested Development” star Portia has also complained Ellen cares more about her fur-shedding cats and dogs, said the source.

What Brad wants more for the holiday is not a present or a toy, but a chance to spend the time with his kids —Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9. “The holidays are extra hard for Brad,” a colleague of the Fury star EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He misses his kids more than ever. He does get to see them but it’s not nearly as much as he would like and it’s always up to Angelina when it happens.”  Brad and Angie’s custody setup isn’t just hard on him, but also on Brad’s parents. “They’re not seeing their grandchildren the way they would like to be,” the insider tells HollywoodLife.com. “They would love Brad to bring them all to Missouri for Christmas but it’s very unlikely Angelina will go for that, she’s not going to want to be without them on Christmas. And what’s even worse is that Brad’s got to worry that she might take them out of the country for the holidays, to London or something. She’s very unpredictable.” A rep for Mr. Pitt declined to comment to HollywoodLife.com on this.  She may be “unpredictable,” but it seems she understands how important it is for her kids to see their father. The Girl, Interrupted invited Brad to go trick-or-treating with the kids on Halloween, a source EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. She knows that Brad will always be a part of the kids’ lives, so hopefully these two can work out the holiday schedule so they both have a happy Christmas.  After all, seeing Brad and Angie play nice during Christmas is exactly what their kids want. They would actually love it if they could spend the whole day with both mom and dad, an insider told HollywoodLife.com. Maybe next Christmas? While Angie and Brad have “come a long way” since she filed for divorce in 2016, they’re “definitely not at the stage of being friends” yet. So, don’t expect Ms. Jolie to join the Pitts for a Missouri-style family Christmas.  What do you think Brad and Angie should do, HollywoodLifers?"
"According to CNN, the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had “no value” and were “like ISIS,” and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad, and now the racist has been arrested.The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 — $8,832.73 per month — according to public records.Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as ‘n*ggers'”. One of Nucera’s officers “made numerous recordings” of Nucera that “contained extremely offensive racist comments” over the course of a year because he was “alarmed” by Nucera’s racism, according to the affidavit.The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn’t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “escalated into a physical struggle,” that both teens “resisted arrest” and that one of the officers used pepper spray.AdvertisementAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old’s head and slammed it “into the right side of the metal doorjamb,” according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old’s head make “a loud thud” as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn’t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had “stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.” The use of force wasn’t reported to the department.Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “f*cking tired” of African-Americans.“I’ll tell you what, it’s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,” Nucera allegedly said. “And that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,” he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl’s aunt, who was present at the arrest. “Fucking nipple hanging bitch. I’m so tired of them, man.”Nucera allegedly said that black people should “stay the fuck out of Bordentown” and referred to the 18-year-old as “fucking little, fucking n****r.”In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “put my hands” on him.“These n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,” Nucera allegedly said. “They should line them all up and mow ’em down. I’d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I’m tired of it.”“The conduct alleged is shocking,” acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.“It’s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.”AdvertisementNucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on a bail of $500,000."

"With a baby on the way, Kim Kardashian & Kanye West have reportedly been fighting more than ever — especially because Kim insists the birth be filmed for TV!  Kim Kardashian, 37, has already admitted that having a surrogate carry her and Kanye West‘s, 40, third child is “so much harder” than personally being pregnant. And it seems Kanye isn’t making things any easier for the reality star. In fact, a new report from InTouch Weekly claims the couple has been fighting constantly in the weeks leading up to their daughter’s arrival, and it’s driving Kim nuts. Their main source of tension? The mag claims Kim wants to film their child’s birth for Keeping Up With The Kardashians, while Kanye is totally against it. Click here to see adorable pics of the Kardashian kids.  “They’re at loggerheads about the birth being filmed for Keeping Up With The Kardashians,” an insider for the publication told the mag. “Kanye’s made it clear that cameras are banned from the delivery room.” On top of that, Kanye reportedly doesn’t even want Kris Jenner, 62, to be there either — apparently he wants to keep things super private and intimate! Kim, on the other hand, is not having any of it. “Kim’s insisting that Kris be by her side, and is trying to convince Kanye that filming it will increase their popularity and the show’s ratings,” the source added.  As of yet though, the two apparently have not come to an agreement. Instead they’ve “been arguing nonstop,” the source said. “It’s driving Kim crazy.” As a reminder, Kim and Kanye did NOT film the births of North West, 4, or Saint West, 2, for the show, so we can’t imagine this new baby’s grand entrance will be any different. Something that is different though, is the fact that the family had to use a surrogate this time around, as doctors advised Kim not to give birth for a third time. And while Kim’s said in the past that she and her surrogate get along, InTouch‘s report also claims the tide has shifted, and now the surrogate doesn’t even want Kim in the delivery room when she gives birth!  “There will be major tension between them in the delivery room,” a second source told the publication. “The surrogate doesn’t even want Kim to be there at this point, but she has no other choice. Everyone is fearful a fight could break out between them!” Yikes! Now THAT would be interesting to catch on tape for KUWTK!  Tell us, HollywoodLifers — do you think Kim and Kanye’s baby’s birth will end up being filmed for TV?"

"Next Up Criminal Minds Exclusive: The New Case Has a Startling Connection to an Old Unsub  Jason Blossom's murderer has been found and it was a deeply chilling reveal for Riverdale fans.  It turns out that Clifford Blossom (Barclay Hope) is the one who pulled the trigger on his own son. A hidden flash drive found in Jason's (Trevor Stines) varsity jacket revealed footage from the Whyte Wyrm's basement that confirmed Clifford Blossom shot his own son in the head.  It took several twists and turns to get to the truth, though. The first gut punch was FP Jones (Skeet Ulrich) confessing to the crime Archie (KJ Apa) and his friends knew he didn't commit. Then Hal Cooper (Lochlyn Munro) dropped the bomb that his grandfather was actually a Blossom — meaning that Polly (Tiera Skovbye) and Jason are actually related.  Cole Sprouse, Casey Cott and Camilla Mendes, Riverdale Photo: Bettina Strauss, Bettina Strauss/The CW  Betty (Lili Reinhart) immediately assumed the incest was motive for the Blossoms to kill their own son. This put her a lot closer to the truth than Archie and Veronica (Camilla Mendes), who continued on their mission to find out if Veronica's imprisoned father, Hiram Lodge, had any connection to the brutal murder. It turns out that Veronica's father is guilty of many things, but murder isn't one of them.  Meanwhile, it turns out FP confessed because Clifford had threatened to harm Jughead (Cole Sprouse) if he didn't take the rap for the crime. While the sheriff knows who really pulled the trigger, FP still has to do time for tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice, which leaves Jughead without a parental unit and staying with the Andrews until further notice.  Dear Diary: Why Do I Care More About Riverdale's Parents?  Now the big question heading into the Season 1 finale is, why did Clifford Blossom do it? The entire town knows that he's the man who pulled the trigger, but the Blossom patriarch hung himself before the police could bring him in for questioning. The finale next week will have to dig into what drove Clifford to want his son dead and, of course, set up the next mystery for the show's already-ordered second season.  The choice to make Clifford Blossom the murderer isn't the darkest route the show could have gone — that would have been Archie — but it does leave an open-ended path for the show to follow in their second effort. The mystery of who shot Jason may be wrapped up, but the ghost of the Blossom heir still looms over this sleepy small down, and there are more mysteries to uncover in the months after his fateful death.  Riverdale's first season finale airs Thursday, May 11 at 9/8c on The CW.  (Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS, one of The CW's parent companies)"
"Is she, or isn’t she? Twitter is buzzing with reports that Kylie Jenner is in labor.  While it’s unclear where the rumors started, multiple social media users are claiming that the 20-year-old Lip Kit maven has been spotted at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles.  “Is Kylie Jenner really in labour or fake news?” one user tweeted with pictures of the two screenshots that seemingly started the rumor that Jenner was seen at Cedars.

"Image copyright Roc Nation Image caption Jay-Z receives his platinum award from the RIAA  Jay-Z's latest album, 4:44, has been certified platinum less than a week after it was released - reflecting sales of one million copies in the US.  On the face of it, this is hugely impressive. In the space of just five days, Jay-Z has landed the sixth biggest-selling album of the year.  His first-week sales are now expected to double those of Kendrick Lamar's Damn! - previously the year's fastest-selling album - which shifted 603,000 copies back in April.  The feat looks even more impressive because 4:44 is only available on Tidal, the streaming service Jay-Z owns.  But then Variety magazine noticed something odd: The photograph of Jay-Z receiving his platinum award was taken before the album was released.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jay-Z's new song Bam is made Radio 1's ""hottest record""  How could the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) be so sure he'd pass the sales barrier?  Well, it turns out that Jay-Z had done a deal with mobile company Sprint (a major shareholder in Tidal), who gave away copies of the album to their subscribers.  Crucially, Sprint paid for each of those copies, making every ""free"" album eligible for a platinum award; and the RIAA says Jay-Z's label RocNation had to provide evidence that the downloads were in fact initiated by consumers.  But still - the RIAA rules state that the wholesale price of the album only needs to be $2 (£1.55) to register as a sale - so Sprint probably paid Jay-Z less than it would cost to air an advert during the Super Bowl (up to $3.8 million for 30 seconds).  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 4:44 sees Jay-Z respond to Beyonce's accusations of infidelity on her album Lemonade  It's almost certain that these downloads are what spurred Jay-Z's album to platinum status. To do it on streaming alone, the album's tracks would have had to be streamed 1.5 billion times, since 1,500 streams of a song count as one ""sale"" under current chart rules.  Given that Tidal has, at best, 3 million subscribers, each of them would have needed to listen to the album 500 times to push sales over the one million mark - an impossibility in just five days.  The album's performance in the UK - where the album is only available on Tidal - is instructive here. On Monday afternoon, when the Official Charts Company publishes its midweek sales flash, 4:44 hadn't been streamed enough times to make the Top 100.  (In the US, the free-but-paid-for downloads aren't chart eligible, so Jay-Z won't make a huge impact on the Billboard countdown, either).  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tidal was launched by an all-star line-up in 2015, promising better returns to artists - but it has struggled to compete with Apple and Spotify  So why go through this rigmarole? Well, the benefit to Jay-Z, in marketing terms, is huge. Music executives believe that gold and platinum awards have a bandwagon effect, leading to even-bigger sales.  And the RIAA has been accused of massaging the figures that count towards their awards before.  In 1994, for example, the music industry body claimed that the Lion King soundtrack had sold 7 million copies. SoundScan, which compiles the charts, contested the actual figure was 4.9 million. It turned out the RIAA had counted records that had been shipped to stores, but were still sitting on shelves and in warehouses (it also counts music distributed by non-retail record clubs, mail order houses, specialty stores and direct marketing sales).  So while you should take Jay-Z's figures with a pinch of marketing salt, it's also worth noting that 4:44 has been illegally downloaded almost a million times this week.  Fans are still eager to hear it, no matter how they're getting the music.  Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"Alicia Keys is really in it to win it as a coach on The Voice. After promoting the reality competition on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon last week, the singer appeared on NBC's The Today Show Tuesday (Mar. 7) to give morning viewers a taste of her fighting spirit.  While sitting down with Today's co-anchors Willie Geist and Carson Daly, the singer -- who was appropriately displayed on screen with the headline ""This Girl Is Still On Fire"" -- discussed motherhood, her singing career, and how they have influenced her judging role on The Voice. Both hosts were intrigued by the ""girl crush"" between Keys and her fellow coach, Gwen Stefani, even comparing their connection to the bromance of Blake Shelton and Adam Levine. But perhaps the most notable thing Keys said about her relationship with her fellow female coach is that it's even stronger than the one Stefani has with Shelton.  With a laugh and grin from ear to ear, the ""In Common"" songstress joked ""we love each other more than Blake and Gwen love each other, straight up!"" Shelton and Stefani -- who have been dating for about 16 months -- have been a guilty pleasure for viewers, as their fairytale romance is on full display each episode, especially this season.  Keys described her working chemistry with Gwen as ""amazing"" due to their long friendship. The singer had nothing but positive things to say about her experience as a judge calling it ""fun"" and boasting about the love that all the coaches share for one another.

"It’s time to uncork the bubbly! Jedediah Bila and her fiancé, Jeremy Scher, are married, Us Weekly can confirm.  Celebrity Weddings of 2018  The 39-year-old former View cohost and her love tied the knot in Huntington, New York, on Saturday, February 17.  “As 60 of their closest family and friends filled the room, Jedediah walked down the aisle as Jeremy beamed with joy — you could truly feel the love in this magical evening!” wedding planner Michael Russo tells Us.  The glowing bride opened up to Us and shared exclusive details of the happy couple’s fairytale wedding. “I’m super excited. Super, super excited,” Bila told Us. “I always wanted to get married, but I never thought I would do the big wedding dress and the beautiful venue. I always thought I was gonna be on a beach somewhere, just a couple of friends, doing it really casual. So it’s crazy.”  The star, who donned a Rivini lace ballgown and earrings from Susan Hanover, selected a white gold eternity style wedding band with wraparound diamonds. Scher, for his part, sported a traditional tuxedo and chose a plain yellow gold band.  Celebrity Engagement Rings of 2017: See the Bling!  “Everyone always thinks of me as the rule breaker and the troublemaker,” the former Fox News contributor said. “Even in my politics, I don’t fit into a box, I break rules. But my wedding has so many traditional components, it’s so funny.”  Of the ceremony, which was attended by 60 people including View host Sunny Hostin, the New York native gushed: “What I’m looking forward to the most [about my wedding day] is that moment of walking down the aisle and seeing him and having him see me and having that moment where we’re in front together. And we’re just looking at each other. I’ll be in my dress and he’ll be in his tux. It’s just one of those once in a lifetime moments that I kind of want to hold onto.”  Celebrity Engagements of 2018  She continued: “We’ve been living together for a while and we go through the daily grind and all that, but I think there’s only one moment in your life where you’re in front of the minister and you’re saying your vows. And you’re like, ‘My life is gonna be different from here on and I’m gonna be married.’ It’s really exciting and warm and wonderful. I think that moment, that one … I’m gonna take a pause and just kind of absorb it all before I … ’cause you can’t quite get it back the same way ever again.’”  To help coordinate the affair, the Daytime Emmy Award winner tapped Michael Russo Events — wedding planner to the stars — who arranged retro tunes from Richie Hart Events and flowers from Pedestals. “The venue is dripping in garden roses and hydrangea,” a designer from Pedestal’s told Us. “Jedediah wanted a whimsical and garden feel.” The couple’s dinner offering included filet mignon and seared Atlantic salmon followed by a custom designed vanilla and chocolate wedding cake with mousse filling.

"Tia Mowry‘s hard work has paid off!  After being diagnosed with endometriosis, the Sister Sister actress overhauled her diet and has been sticking to the principles outlined in her cookbook Whole New You. She shuns “processed, packaged” foods and instead opts for “whole foods” like fruits, vegetables, seeds and whole grains, she told PEOPLE.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  And the Tia Mowry At Home star, 38, is thrilled with the results, which she recently shared on Instagram. The mom posted an image of herself wearing leggings and lifting up her t-shirt to reveal her abs, “I’ve lost 20 pounds! Many asked how? Diet and cooking out of my cook book #wholenewyou,” she captioned the photo.  Although she mostly sticks to clean eating, Mowry will still indulge in the occasional treat. Prior to posting her weight loss photo, the star took to Instagram to share a picture of herself licking an ice cream cone. “Ice cream didn’t stand a chance,” she wrote.  Mowry didn’t always have such a healthy relationship with food. In her cookbook, she reveals she developed poor eating habits on the set of Sister Sister, where she would snack on candy, cookies and potato chips. She then tried to counteract the junk food by taking diet pills.

I got skinny, true, but the pills caused my heart to race, and I knew in my gut that I was hurting myself.”  Now the star is focused on her healthy lifestyle. Her daily food log might include gluten-free pancakes, kale and almond fried rice for lunch, and a light fish with veggies for dinner. “What I eat and what I put into my body is extremely important to me,” she wrote."

"Warner Bros. put a spell on Harry Potter fans Tuesday with the release of the first trailer for “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.”  In the trailer, Eddie Redmayne returns as the charmingly clumsy Newt Scamander, while Jude Law makes his Wizarding World debut as a young Albus Dumbledore. It’s teased that Scamander is acting under orders from Dumbledore to head to Paris, but as the future-Hogwarts headmaster notes, Scamander isn’t one for taking orders well.  The David Yates film follows Dumbledore and Scamander, his former student, as they join forces to recapture an escaped Gellert Grindelwald, played by Johnny Depp, who is on a mission to dominate all non-magical people with the help of his pureblood wizard followers.  “I can’t move against Grindelwald,” Dumbledore tells Scamander in the clip. “It has to be you.”  The trailer debuted amid casting controversy surrounding Depp, who was accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife, Amber Heard, in court filings. J.K. Rowling, the Harry Potter author who wrote the screenplays for both “Fantastic Beasts” movies, has since defended the decision to cast Depp on Twitter, citing both Heard’s and Depp’s desires to move on.  “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” marks Yates’ fifth foray into the Wizarding World. He previously directed the last four movies in the original Harry Potter franchise, as well as the first “Fantastic Beasts” installment. His is set to direct the remaining three movies rounding out the “Fantastic Beasts” saga, with Rowling continuing on as a screenwriter. “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” hits theaters Nov. 16."

"David Hasselhoff‘s financial crisis continues.  The former “Baywatch” star can no longer afford the $21,000-per-month alimony payments to ex-wife Pamela Bach as he claims less than $4,000 to his name, according to TMZ. Hasselhoff, 63, who filed court documents last month to cut off the payments, has shelled out $2.3 million to his former spouse since their divorce in 2006.  Bach, 52, receives $252,000 per year from Hasselhoff, but the singer/actor only grosses $112,000 a month. Though Hasselhoff spends $66,000 of it, with living expenses, taxes and Bach’s payments, he has minimal funds to save. And while a court hearing has been set for the end of May, Hasselhoff isn’t sure if his current endeavors will be enough to salvage the payments.  Hasselhoff’s European tour was cut short due to poor ticket sales, and he’s reportedly unsure if his new reality show, “Hoff the Record,” will find the same success as his previous small-screen endeavors.  While the documents obtained by the website noted that Hasselhoff’s assets, including real estate, cars, jewelry and retirement savings, among others, total $1.79 million, the cash flow is drying up.  Though Bach’s team alleges that Hasselhoff’s net worth is more than $120 million, the newly engaged star has already nixed retirement plans to stay afloat.  “I am 63 years of age, and am at an age when I should be preparing for retirement and not having to continue working in order to pay [Bach’s] support,” Hasselhoff said in papers filed in April.  Though he is set to make an appearance in next year’s “Baywatch” reboot, it’s unclear if that paycheck will ease his stress. In addition to Bach’s payments, as well as his own expenses, Hasselhoff is responsible for daughters Hayley, 23, and TaylorAnn, 25, who live under his roof.

"Shannon Beador has been 'blindsided' by her estranged husband David's new relationship.  David has gone public on Instagram with new girlfriend Lesley, who he reportedly started dating in December, just two months after Shannon announced their separation after 17 years of marriage.

And away we go …. #notdiscreetanymore #happyvalentinesday,' David wrote on Lesley's Instagram picture of some red balloons on Wednesday.  He also added emojis of a plane, a tropical island, a sun and two glasses of wine.  The pretty blonde had captioned the photo with a simple heart emoji but replied to David in the comments, writing: '@david_beador Happy Valentine’s Day to the most kind, funny, motivated, loving & man! The sky is more blue & my coffee taste better with you in my life'  Lesley, who is reportedly 20 years his junior, has two young children of her own.  A source told People Shannon was 'blindsided by the relationship'.  Moving on: Lesley is a Newport Beach local who has two children of her own  'Taking the high road': RHOC's Shannon Beador has been blindsided that ex David has a new girlfriend and is taking it publicly so soon after their split  'It’s disgusting and cruel that David would be putting this out so publicly as their divorce is not yet finalized and they share three daughters together,' they added.  'He’s always been selfish and is clearly not thinking about how this will affect his children.'  It first emerged last month that David was no longer hiding his new love as he referred to himself as 'the lucky one' in the comments of Instagram photo Lesley shared of the two of them.  'David wasted no time and has already started dating again and has moved on entirely,' an insider told E! News at the time.  'It’s disgusting and cruel that David would be putting this out so publicly as their divorce is not yet finalized' a source told People  Falling apart: Shannon, 53, shared this inspirational quote to Instagram last week  'He’s been seeing this woman for at least a few weeks now and the word has spread around Newport Beach.'  Shannon meanwhile returned to filming Season 13 of the Real Housewives on February 9.  Last week the mother-of-three shared an inspirational quote to Instagram which read: 'Sometimes when things are falling apart they may actually be falling into place.'  According to Page Six Shannon is requesting spousal support and attorneys' fees to be paid by David.  The star is also asking for sole physical custody of their three children, 16-year-old Sophie and 13-year-old twins Stella and Adeline and joint legal custody.  Shannon has requested David be granted child visitation.  She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.  The Bravo star filed documents in Orange County Superior Court in December after announcing her separation in October.  She and David will be in divorce court on March 12.  The split came two years after the couple worked to repair their relationship after David admitted to having an affair.  Single: The split came two years after Shannon and David worked to repair their relationship after David admitted to having an affair  The crumbling of their marriage was documented on Real Housewives with David admitting that he'd been unfaithful to her during season 10; on season 11 they renewed their vows. But still there were problems.  During the season 12 reunion show of RHOC she broke down in tears when she said it was David, not her, who wanted the marriage to end.  'It’s not what I wanted and it’s been really, really hard,' she said.  'We went on a trip to Hawaii, which I kind of hoped would bring everything together, but he left the trip early. And when I came home, he said, ""We’re done,""' she told the reunion host Andy Cohen.  The star is asking for sole physical custody of her their three children, 16-year-old Sophie and 13-year-old twins Stella and Adeline and joint legal custody  'I said to David, when he told me it was over, ""What happened? We had a couple of amazing years."" And he goes, ""We had a couple good months."" It was just a knife in the heart.'  Shannon also revealed David became distant from her when she gained 40lbs.  She has been very frank with her fans about her struggle to lose weight and how the stress from her bad marriage made her eat more.  She told People last year: 'It’s heartbreaking for me and my daughters that this is the road that had to be taken but it’s the only way.  'I felt alone in my marriage. You can do what you can to keep your family together, but you have to have willing parties.  'You need two people to make a marriage work, and that just wasn’t happening in our relationship.'"

"A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the “best way to help Israel”.Newobserveronline.com reports:The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton’s private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in Israel’s interests.“The best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran’s “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel.She specifically links Iran’s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran’s “atom bomb” program threatens Israel’s “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other “adversaries of Israel” such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten Israel’s interests.Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.Iran’s nuclear program and Syria’s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly.An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.It is, Clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel’s security.This would not come about through a “direct attack,” Clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.”The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel’s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel’s security, it would also ease Israel’s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad “and his family” with violence is the “right thing” to do:In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s mind.The email proves—as if any more proof was needed—that the US government has been the main sponsor of the growth of terrorism in the Middle East, and all in order to “protect” Israel.It is also a sobering thought to consider that the “refugee” crisis which currently threatens to destroy Europe, was directly sparked off by this US government action as well, insofar as there are any genuine refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria.In addition, over 250,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, which has spread to Iraq—all thanks to Clinton and the Obama administration backing the “rebels” and stoking the fires of war in Syria.The real and disturbing possibility that a psychopath like Clinton—whose policy has inflicted death and misery upon millions of people—could become the next president of America is the most deeply shocking thought of all.Clinton’s public assertion that, if elected president, she would “take the relationship with Israel to the next level,” would definitively mark her, and Israel, as the enemy of not just some Arab states in the Middle East, but of all peace-loving people on earth."

"CLOSE These are the women that will represent the U.S. in Pyeongchang, South Korea in February. USA TODAY Sports  Mirai Nagasu, Bradie Tennell and Karen Chen will make up the Olympic team. (Photo: Kyle Terada, USA TODAY Sports)  SAN JOSE, Calif. – There will be no surprises this year. The U.S. women’s Olympic figure skating team is set: Bradie Tennell, Mirai Nagasu and Karen Chen.  Unlike four years ago, when U.S. Figure Skating’s international committee chose to replace Nagasu with Ashley Wagner, the committee went by the order of the national championships, picking the first three finishers in the women’s competition at the 2018 nationals.  This means that the women’s team in Pyeongchang next month will be entirely different from the team that competed in Sochi four years ago: Wagner, Gracie Gold and Polina Edmunds. For most of the four years leading up to 2018, either Wagner or Gold, or both, were at the top of the sport domestically.  MORE: Wagner 'furious' at scoring  Each of the three women to make the team is something of a surprise. Tennell, 19, rose to prominence as recently as Thanksgiving weekend when she finished a surprising third at Skate America. That was the same competition Wagner, who finished fourth here, suddenly withdrew with an ankle infection.  Nagasu, 24, had an uneven fall season, but her attempts to land the difficult triple axel renewed her career. She won her only national title 10 years ago, in 2008. She finished fourth at the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver.  Chen, 18, also overcame a disappointing fall season. She won the 2017 national title and finished fourth at the worlds in Helsinki, helping to secure three spots for the U.S. women at the 2018 Olympics.  Wagner, 26, the only U.S. woman to win a world championship medal in the past 11 seasons (silver in 2016), was named the first alternate.  PHOTOS: Best of the 2018 U.S. Figure Skating Championship"
"The heart wants what it wants — and Selena Gomez's heart just wants her puppy back! It's been almost two months since she split from her ex-boyfriend The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) and even though they've both moved on, there's one major thing that the former couple is still fighting about — the dog that they adopted while they were still together! Sources exclusively reveal to Life & Style that Sel thinks she should keep their Cavalier King Charles Spaniel pup, Charlie, ""and so does Abel.”  “Selena is angry,” says the source, “because she feels like it was more of a gift from Abel to her than a mutually adopted pet, so she’s determined to keep it.”  Selena Gomez gave her dog Charlie a kiss while on set of her untitled film project. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  Back in September — just one month before their split — Selena, 25, and Abel, 27, were spotted together at an NYC pet shop and they seemed to have picked out the puppy together. It also seemed like they shared custody of the pup even though Selena is the only one who had been spotted with Charlie in public. But it seems like Abel has grown attached to Charlie too, and he shared photos of the adorable dog on his Instagram story before their split.  Selena got Charlie just days after she announced that she had spent the summer recovering from a kidney transplant as a result of her battle with lupus, so it seems like Charlie helped her get through that health scare. But now that she's feeling better, Sel is getting back to work on an untitled project with controversial filmmaker Woody Allen and that's why Abel thinks he should be the one to have custody of Charlie.  “He thinks Selena won’t be able to take care of Charlie as well as he will because of her schedule,” the source says, adding that Selena isn’t listening — and she won't give up Charlie without a fight. “She is in love with her puppy.”  For more on your favorite celebrities, pick up the new issue of Life & Style on stands now!

"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie Are Today’s New Anchor Team  As for future projects, Couric is focused on her new documentary series as well as her popular podcast — and teaching her husband John Molner about social media.  “I’m having so much fun doing my podcast with my friend Brian Goldsmith,” she says. “I’ve been able to have extended and substantive conversations with so many great, interesting people, like Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Alec Baldwin, David Axelrod, Ava DuVernay and Ina Garten. And now we’re ‘dropping’ episodes weekly. Coming up: Laverne Cox and Amy Schumer.  “Meanwhile, I’m still happily married (after three years!) and I’m teaching John how to do Instagram stories,” she continues. “His are pretty lame so far. I’m also getting ready for my younger daughter Carrie’s college graduation. (GULP!) And there are some other cool projects I’ll be able to announce soon. I’m addicted to work!"

I intend to turn this unfortunate incident into a positive life changing event. Once again, I sincerely apologize for my actions. I have the greatest respect for police officers and the job they do. My actions alleged in the police report do not reflect my core values and my law abiding character.  I am so grateful for the love and support that I am receiving from my family, friends and loyal supporters.”  De Lesseps was arrested Saturday and charged the following day with disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer/firefighter/EMT, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.  Luann de Lesseps  She had been discovered trespassing in a hotel room with an unidentified man, according to a police report. The pair had entered the wrong room at the Colony Hotel in Palm Beach and refused to leave.  According to the report, de Lesseps “shoved” a police officer who responded to the scene and “slammed” the bathroom door on his forehead.

I want to offer my most sincere apologies to anyone that I might have offended with my behavior. This was my first time in Palm Beach since my wedding and being here brought up buried emotions. I am committed to a transformative and hopeful 2018 — Luann de Lesseps (@CountessLuann) December 24, 2017  After her arrest, de Lesseps — who had gotten married to ex-husband Tom D’Agostino in Palm Beach on last New Year’s Eve before their divorce seven months later — released a statement saying, “This was my first time in Palm Beach since my wedding, and being here brought up long-buried emotions. I want to offer my sincere apologies to anyone I might have offended with my behavior. I am committed to a transformative and hopeful 2018.”  RELATED VIDEO: The Early Warning Signs That May Have Led to Luann De Lesseps’ Divorce From Tom D’Agostino  A source told PEOPLE that “Luann was out with a girlfriend at the Colony Hotel where she had her wedding brunch just a year ago — it was the first time she had been back to Palm Beach since the wedding.”  “Memories from that day came flooding back, she was emotional and her behavior was out of character,” the source added.  The mother of two was released on her own recognizance Sunday, according to the Palm Beach Post, and Judge Ted Booras said she would be allowed to return to her home state of New York. However, he warned her not to ignore the charges against her. “I don’t think it would be that hard to find you,” he said.  She is due back in court Jan. 25, 2018."
"John Cena and Nikki Bella had a lot of ups and downs in their six-year relationship, one of which was the time Bella revealed that she had been married before she met Cena.  The secret was one of the biggest plot points of Total Divas season 2, which aired in 2014.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  By that point, Cena, 40, and Bella, 34, had been dating for two years. She was even living with him, having signed his 75-page cohabitation agreement that forces her to move out all her belongings “as soon as possible” upon their separation.  But Bella was still hiding her past nuptials. And it turns out, it was not just from Cena.  During an emotional sit-down captured on camera, Bella told her family about her wedding for the first time — explaining to mom Kathy Colace, brother JJ Garcia and twin sister Brie (among others) that she was ashamed of her decision.  “I got married when I was 20. And got divorced at 23, to my high school sweetheart,” Bella said. “Basically we got married by Elvis. We drove to Vegas, did it.”  The union was something Bella regretted from the beginning. “Even when I started walking down the aisle, I knew this was a huge mistake and how can I get out of it and I couldn’t,” she recalled. “I tried to forget about it but now it’s starting to come up, and I figured you guys have to hear from me before you hear from anyone else. It’s crazy ’cause John doesn’t even know and here we talk about marriage and we never bring it up.”  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Her family were not happy, especially Colace, who wondered why Bella didn’t think she could come to her.  But it was Garcia who showed the most anger, some of which was on behalf of Cena.  “John’s gonna be pissed. I’d be pissed for him if you hadn’t told him. ‘Cause you talk about marriage all the time with him, don’t expect it to be easy,” Garcia said. “[These things] really don’t just happen. You don’t just run off and get married and not tell your family for 10 years. That doesn’t just happen. You do what you got to do and I hope you figure it all out with John.”  It was Garcia who would accidentally spill the beans about the secret nuptial to Cena first, mentioning it at sister Brie’s 2014 wedding to her husband Daniel Bryan.  “I heard you’re handling everything awesome,” he told Cena. “For her to tell you that she’s been married before and you had no problem with it, I have to give you kudos man.  Cena look flabbergasted but kept the conversation moving.  Later, Bella finally got the courage to say something to Cena herself.  Luckily, having gone through a divorce (to ex-wife Elizabeth Huberdeau in 2012 after three years of marriage), Cena was more understanding than anything. Still, as the two had been fighting about marriage — with Cena reluctant to walk down the aisle again — he encouraged Bella to be more honest with him.  “When the focus of most of our problems has to do with that particular topic, maybe I should know that stuff,” he told Bella. “I know how you feel. You’re a human being, so I know you want certain things. But I would especially know how you feel about it because you had a bad experience.”  “I don’t care,” Cena added. “What you did before you met me is what you did before you met me, I don’t need to know everything about you. It’s just when you can tell other people and I kind of would like to be on that totem pole somewhere — I don’t have to be at the top … I just would like to be on it.”  Gary Miller/FilmMagic  Bella look relieved, though she said she did “feel bad” she didn’t tell Cena.  “I’ve realized that I need to start having confidence in my relationship with John and that he accepts me for all my faults,” she told the camera. “I am so relieved that John and I have made up and I’m just happy to be here with my family… honestly, nothing can go wrong now. Everything is perfect.”  RELATED VIDEO: John Cena and Nikki Bella End Engagement Weeks Before Destination Wedding  Cena and Nikki announced that they called off their engagement Sunday, a year after he proposed during WrestleMania 33.  The couple, who were together for six years, were supposed to marry May 5 during their planned destination wedding.  An insider previously told PEOPLE she was the one who pulled the plug on their wedding.  “John acted more and more like he was doing her a favor by somehow conceding to go ahead and marry her,” the insider said. “[Nikki] doesn’t need a pity proposal, a pity wedding, a pity husband. She’s a phenomenal, tremendous woman.”"

The 20-year-old, who shares baby Stormi with boyfriend Travis Scott , proved once and for all that she's still got it as she posed up in nothing but a white swimsuit.  In a pair of pictures she posted on Instagram, Kylie, who recently ditched her lip fillers, gives the camera a sultry gaze as she shows off her curves.  ""Good morning,"" the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star captioned the sexy snaps, and her fans couldn't get enough.  (Image: Splash News)  In the first picture, lip kit mogul Kylie lies on her side in the white swimsuit, which features mesh detailing on the body and mesh sleeves.  She clasps her hands together, revealing a neutral shade on her famous talons, as she stares into the lens.  Her lips are noticeably smaller after she got rid of her fillers and her brunette locks flop over onto the bed with her nude lips and brown eyeshadow giving her a much more natural look.  In the second snap, Kylie lies on her back with her eyes closed and her hands placed on top of her head.  ""In love w/ you,"" one fan commented.  While another said: ""Ok these are hot babe ""  (Image: Instagram/kyliejenner)  Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now  ""QUEEN,"" one dubbed her.  And another said: ""what a babe!! Loving this look""  It comes after fans came up with some bizarre theories about why she decided to stop getting lip injections to plump up her pout.  Some fans have a wild theory that she's got rid of her fillers and stopped using fake tan in order to look more 'Asian'.  And some trolls think it's because there was some overlap in her relationship with Tyga, who is of Vietnamese descent, and her current boyfriend Travis.  They think that Kylie is trying to make herself look more like Stormi in a bid to stop people questioning who her father is.  (Image: Getty)  (Image: kyliejenner/instagram)  One troll wrote on Twitter: ""EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT KYLIE 'S HALF ASIAN BABY IS BY TYGA, WHO IS HALF ASIAN...""  Kylie's mum Kris Jenner was forced to swing into action after Tyga took to Snapchat when news of her pregnancy broke, alleging, ""hell nah that's my kid.""  The couple split in April 2017 but were rumoured to have still been sleeping together around the time she fell pregnant.  But the rumours were dismissed by the famous family as ""silly"".  And soon afterwards, Tyga backtracked on it.  ""I didn’t comment on anything, I didn’t comment on anything, it was a fake story. It’s all a fake story,"" he told Metro."
"It was 1989. We were only 24. I had precisely zero expectations about this going anywhere. But when he knocked on the door of my little frame house, I thought, “Uh-oh, there is something highly likable about this person.”  By the end of dinner, I knew I wanted to marry him.  Jason? He knew a year later.  I have never been on Tinder, Bumble or eHarmony, but I’m going to create a general profile for Jason right here, based on my experience of coexisting in the same house with him for, like, 9,490 days.  First, the basics: He is 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, with salt-and-pepper hair and hazel eyes.  The following list of attributes is in no particular order because everything feels important to me in some way.  He is a sharp dresser. Our young adult sons, Justin and Miles, often borrow his clothes. Those who know him — or just happen to glance down at the gap between his dress slacks and dress shoes — know that he has a flair for fabulous socks. He is fit and enjoys keeping in shape.  If our home could speak, it would add that Jason is uncannily handy. On the subject of food — man, can he cook. After a long day, there is no sweeter joy than seeing him walk in the door, plop a grocery bag down on the counter, and woo me with olives and some yummy cheese he has procured before he gets to work on the evening’s meal.  Jason loves listening to live music; it’s our favorite thing to do together. I should also add that our 19-year-old daughter, Paris, would rather go to a concert with him than anyone else."

"Kelly Clarkson will join NBC’s “The Voice” as a coach for season 14, Variety has learned.  The pop star and season-one “American Idol” champion will join longtime coaches Blake Shelton and Adam Levine for the NBC talent-competition series’ spring 2018 cycle. A fourth coach for the season has not yet been set. Jennifer Hudson and Miley Cyrus are already confirmed to be joining regulars Levine and Shelton this fall for the show’s 13th season.  Clarkson had been in long-simmering talks about possibly joining “The Voice” for an upcoming season. She was approached by the show multiple times in the past and had expressed interest, but had been unable to work its production cycle into her schedule.  Both Clarkson and Shelton are represented by Narvel Blackstock’s Starstruck Entertainment.  Clarkson had been approached in recent weeks to join “American Idol” as judge for its upcoming relaunch on ABC. The deal with “The Voice” scuttles any possible return to “Idol” for Clarkson, who was the winner of the talent competition’s first season in 2002 and appeared as a guest judge during the show’s 15th and final season on Fox.  Related ‘American Idol’: Ryan Seacrest in Advanced Talks to Return as Host for ABC Revival (EXCLUSIVE)  With season 14 of “The Voice” set to premiere in February, Clarkson will likely be spinning her chair at NBC at the same time that ABC’s “Idol,” expected to debut in March, is getting off the ground. The two shows could even find themselves going head-to-head. ABC has committed to roughly 40 hours of “Idol,” making it highly likely that the show will air two nights a week, as it did on Fox. According to sources, ABC is eyeing Sunday as one of those nights. The end of the spring cycle of “The Bachelor” in mid-March would open up Monday evenings for an hour-long weekly “Idol” results show. There it could face NBC’s regular 8-10 p.m. episode of “The Voice.”  In addition to being the first “Idol” champion, Clarkson is also one of its most distinguished alums, having risen to pop-star status on the strength of singles such as “Since U Been Gone.” Clarkson was also a judge on ABC’s short-lived singing competition “Duets.” In addition to manager Blackstock, she is represented by CAA.  “I’m so excited to join ‘The Voice’ at NBC,” Clarkson said. “We’ve gone back and forth about a role as a coach for years, but the timing hasn’t been right until now. I have always loved appearing on the show as an adviser or performer and established an amazing relationship with the network during my Christmas special. I can’t wait to turn my chair and see the faces of up-and-coming artists and provide them with the help and support they’ve needed to break into the industry. Watch out Shelton, I’m comin’ to win!!”  “Kelly has been a part of ‘The Voice’ family for many years as an adviser and performer. We are thrilled she has chosen to join us as a coach to mentor the next generation through our unique vocal boot camp,” said Paul Telegdy, president, alternative and reality group, NBC Entertainment. “Every time Kelly Clarkson sings you are reminded what an incredible voice really is. We are looking forward to the sound of Kelly Clarkson on ‘The Voice.’”"
"Zayn Malik released the action-packed video for his new single ""Let Me"" on Thursday (April 12), and fans were quick to notice a face that was quite similar to ex-girlfriend's Gigi Hadid .  Let's start at the top: The song is essentially about Zayn asking someone to let him love them forever. He makes specific references at a number of points in the song, alluding to wanting ""walks on the beach in April,"" and ""duvet days and vanilla ice cream"" again. Elle has already pointed out that the beach walking thing could be referencing Gigi's birthday, which is in April. According to now-deleted Instagram pictures, the two spent celebrated her birthday in 2016, you guessed it, exploring the beach together.  However, while the lyrics are vague enough to keep fans speculating, what seems to be more obvious is his on-screen companion, model Sofia Jamora . Fans on social media have repeatedly noted that she looks strikingly similar to Gigi, between her middle-part blonde hairstyle to even some of her facial features. One person tweeted, ""and also does anyone else think the girl in 'let me' by zayn looks alot like Gigi Hadid?!"" Another fan wrote, ""I’m seeing a lot of comments under the video about Sofia Jamora looking a lot like Gigi and now I can’t unsee it.""  As with everything, it stands to be remembered that it could sincerely all be chalked up to coincidence. Songs and videos are often produced way in advance, and with multiple writers and producers on board. It's more than possible that the song could have nothing to do with his relationship, and Sofia was just an apt fit. Either way, the single is definitely a jam, so we can enjoy it no matter what.

"How much would you pay to watch an episode of ""Game of Thrones"" with Daenerys Targaryen?  Turns out Brad Pitt would have happily plunked down six figures for the honor.  Greg Doherty / Patrick McMullan / Getty Images / Kevin Mazur / Getty Images / .  On Saturday, Jan. 6, Brad joined celebs including Lena Dunham, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Segel, Connie Britton, Patricia Arquette, Mark Burnett, Leonardo DiCaprio -- and ""GOT"" stars Emilia Clarke and Kit Harrington -- at Milk Studios in Los Angeles for a gala to benefit Sean Penn's Haiti disaster recovery charity, the J/P HRO & Disaster Relief Organization.  According to the New York Post, the evening featured an auction where an Emilia-adjacent ""GOT"" viewing session was one of the prizes available to bidders.  Bidding reportedly started at $20,000 as the auctioneer teased the A-list crowd, hollering lines like , ""Is the King of the North here?!"" (The King of the North, it seems, had stepped out of the room to use the men's room.)  Brad, who is reportedly dating but still single since his split from Angelina Jolie, initially offered to pay $80,000 to watch the show with its dragon-mother star, then one-upped his own bid by offering to cough up $90,000. When Kit Harrington returned to the room, he threw an offer in the pot as well, according to the Post, a move that apparently inspired Brad to raise his bid to $120,000.  Ultimately, the actor lost out to another attendee who posted a $160,000 bid.  The annual event also used its platform to celebrate the environmental work Leonardo DiCaprio has been doing in the realm of climate change through his foundation.  ""The biggest challenge now is to make sure that everyone understands what's at stake. But how can we do this when we have a president who, just this week, proposed a massive increase in offshore drilling?"" Leo asked the crowd during his speech.  MediaPunch/REX/Shutterstock  He added: ""Their denial of so much of the scientific proof and evidence belongs in 'the Earth is flat' chapter of human history.""  Leo went on to praise Sean Penn for his aid and recovery work in Haiti.  ""These are obviously incredibly turbulent and scary times,"" Leo said. ""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful citizens can change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that has.""  The $15,000-a-plate gala, which Sean has held annually the night before the Golden Globes every year since 2010, raised more than $3.5 million for his J/P HRO charity, according to the Associated Press. The organization recently expanded its recovery efforts and now works with partner organizations to provide aid in hurricane-damaged communities in Texas, Florida and the Virgin Islands, as well as Haiti."
"Harry Styles has a unique sense of style ... or does he? The singer-songwriter admits he has models his look after '90s country-pop superstar Shania Twain , who was one of his mom's favorite artists when he was growing up.  ""I think both music and fashion, [my] main influence was probably Shania Twain. I think she's amazing,"" Styles raves to Entertainment Tonight .  It's a surprising connection, no doubt, but makes sense when you look at the former One Direction frontman and the country icon — both love colorful, extravagant outfits that defy the norm.  Styles has been putting his foot in the water of country music a lot recently, offering a stellar rendition of Little Big Town 's "" Girl Crush "" during a show at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, where Cam was his opening act. He says the track is ""one of my favorite songs recently that's come out of this place,"" meaning Nashville.  He'll also take trailblazer Kacey Musgraves out on the road with him as an opening act during the U.S. dates of his 2018 Live on Tour . Additionally, the pop singer has said that he wants to collaborate with Chris Stapleton , citing himself as a ""massive fan."" He also has a fan in Gretchen Wilson , who praised his 2017 self-titled album, calling it ""something real.""

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will be tying the knot at St. George's Chapel in one week, and ET is breaking down all the latest updates as they gear up for their May 19 nuptials.  BIGGEST NEWS OF THE WEEK  The excitement is in the air, as Meghan's family and friends are starting to make their way to London. Just in time for Mother's Day, Meghan's mom, Doria Ragland, arrived in England earlier this week.  A source told ET on Thursday that Meghan has ""normal last-minute nerves"" ahead of her nuptials, but is happy to have her mother by her side in the days before she says ""I do."" According to our source, this is the first time Doria will see Meghan's dress, as Meghan just had her final fittings a week and a half ago. The Los Angeles native's father, Thomas Markle, is also expected to arrive by the weekend.  ""Doria will be here to help Meghan relax in the last days before she becomes a [royal],"" the source said, adding that one of Meghan's closest pals, Jessica Mulroney, will arrive next week to ""help Meghan out with last-minute touches ahead of her big day.""  WEDDING COUNTDOWN  So, how many days until the royal wedding? Meghan and Harry will officially be tying the knot in:  Getty Images  ROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP  The rumor mill this week has Queen Elizabeth sneaking a peek at Meghan's wedding dress. The bride's gown is said to be hidden away in Windsor and will show it to the queen this week or possibly the next, according to US Weekly.  Another story circulating the web is that Meghan's gown -- rumored to be a custom Ralph & Russo Couture creation -- will cost approximately $135,600.  ""Meghan’s dress is expected to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" royal expert Melanie Bromley told Harper's Bazaar. ""It's going to be featured in the history books, so needs to stand the test of time.”  The price may seem quite high, though that doesn't compare to Kate Middleton's custom Alexander McQueen design that cost around $400,000. ""But that eye-watering price was befitting for a future queen, so it’s unlikely Meghan’s will be as expensive because it could be seen by some as being disrespectful,” Bromley added.  ET’s royal expert Katie Nicholl had echoed those sentiments back in March, saying, ""I think it's very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that and in doing so try and upstage a future queen.""  OUT AND ABOUT  Although we didn't get a real sighting from Meghan and Prince Harry this week (they're kinda busy, ya know, preparing for a royal wedding!), fans freaked out via social media when Madame Tussauds unveiled two wax figures of the bride-to-be on Wednesday.

In the comments section of one of the Instagram photos, a fan claimed that Mitchell had changed the captions, writing: “before she removed a couple of the photos and edited her captions, she did tag the locations and herself like she was actually there.”  RELATED: Shay Mitchell Has a One Major Rule About Posting Food Photos on Instagram  Mitchell previously revealed she gets “a little angry” when people fake food photos they post on Instagram.  “I love a great food shot and I follow a lot of food blogs,” Mitchell told PEOPLE last month. “But if I ever find out that you don’t really eat that food, and you just used it for a photo, that’s when I get a little angry — not only because you’re wasting it, but because someone like me could have enjoyed it.”  She added: “I don’t do a lot of food photos, but if I did, know that I ate it, and it was amazing enough for me to post it. I will never just order food to take a photo and then not eat it.”"

"George Clooney may find being a dad intimidating, but he’s also completely loving it! Admitting in a new interview that being in charge of 2 humans is daunting, the new father revealed he’s ‘enjoying the ride’ — aw!  George Clooney, 56, is still adjusting to becoming a father-of-two overnight, but as he admitted in a recent interview, so far so good! The actor’s wife, Amal Clooney, 39, gave birth to twins Ella and Alexander Clooney on June 6, and since then, the couple’s lives have changed drastically. “Suddenly, you’re responsible for other people, which is terrifying,” George joked when speaking with The Associated Press. But luckily, the star has tons of help from his superstar wife, whom he gives major credit to. “She’s like an Olympic athlete, she’s doing so beautifully,” he gushed. Click here to see adorable pics of celeb dads with their kids.  George isn’t afraid to get down and dirty with his own parenting duties though, as he admitted he’s a hands-on dad. “Right now my job is changing diapers and walking them around a little bit,” George, who conducted the interview from his home in Lake Como, Italy, said. “I really didn’t think at 56 that I would be the parent of twins.” George also offered up some life advice about going with the flow. “Don’t make plans,” he said. “You always have to just enjoy the ride.”  Sitting down to chat about his new film, Suburbicon, George laughed, “I just have to clean the barf off of my tux. It used to be my barf but now it’s the twins’ barf. So it all works out.” LOL. Clearly he’s embracing fatherhood in all its many forms! As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, George seems to have a way with his newborn son and daughter, and he loves caring for them. “[George] is such a natural parent — it’s amazing how he is with the twins,” a source told us EXCLUSIVELY last month.  “After all the years he protested that he wasn’t cut out for parenthood, it’s mind blowing how good he is. George is so patient and calm around the babies, even when they’ve been on an hour-long crying tear! When he picks the babies up they immediately calm down.” SO precious!  Tell us, HollywoodLifers — do you think George and Amal will show their children to the world soon?"
"Remember when dry shampoo first became popular? It was like the godsend we didn’t know we were waiting for. Finally a product that allowed us to skip showers without having the world know how lazy we are! You could practically hear the scalps of oily-haired girls rejoicing. Unfortunately, we’ve taken things a bit far. We’re misusing the product, and our hair is paying the price.  When I went to visit Nunzio Saviano‘s salon for a new cut, he took one look at my hair and asked, “How often are you using dry shampoo?” Apparently my dull color and rough texture were telltale signs that I’d been hitting the bottle a little too often.  Since my hair is pretty thick and incredibly hard to dry, I tend to wash it once every five days. To make the shampoo last, I spray a little dry shampoo onto my roots every morning. This, according to Saviano, is far too often. “You should only get a day out of your dry shampoo, and then wash,” he says.  So why should dry shampoo be used so sparingly? As Saviano points out, it’s not just baby powder inside those aerosol cans. Tons of chemicals are being sprayed onto your scalp, which clog the pores and don’t let the scalp breathe. Think of it like nail polish. If you’re wearing nail color 24/7, you’re not letting your nails get any oxygen, which is why they can turn yellow. Scalps should be allowed to breathe as well.  To use dry shampoo correctly, only use on your last day of a blowout, and make sure to shampoo it out the following day.  Read more: 6 New Ways to Use Dry Shampoo"
"Julianna Margulies is adding her own experience to the ongoing conversation about sexual assault and harassment in Hollywood—and claims she had a frightening encounter with actor Steven Seagal. The Emmy-winning actress and Seagal costarred in the 1991 film Out for Justice.  A representative for Seagal did not respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment on Friday,  “When I was 23, a casting director, a woman, said, ‘Steven Seagal wants to go over the scene with you in his hotel room at 10 o’clock at night,'” Margulies told Jenny Hutt for SiriusXM’s Just Jenny on Friday.  “I lived in Brooklyn, and I said, ‘Oh, I don’t do that. I don’t travel. I don’t have money for a cab.’ And I didn’t. And I said, ‘And I don’t take subways late at night.’ And she says, ‘Don’t worry we’ll reimburse you. And I’m here, a woman,’ ” the E.R. alum recalled. “I got to the hotel at 10:40, and she wasn’t there. And he was. Alone. And he made sure that I saw his gun, which I had never seen a gun in real life. And I got out of there unscathed.”  Gary Gershoff/WireImage; Paul Archuleta/Getty  In late October, Seagal joined the list of major Hollywood figures accused of sexual misconduct in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Inside Edition correspondent Lisa Guerrero’s recent accusations against Seagal came nearly a decade after Jenny McCarthy recalled an alleged incident in which he asked her to strip naked for the movie Under Siege 2 during a private audition in 1998.  A spokesman for Seagal previously denied McCarthy’s claims. Representatives for Seagal have not responded to PEOPLE’s request for comment regarding any of the claims.  Marguiles also spoke about an alleged past incident with Weinstein.  “I have my own Harvey story, but I never was raped. And I never was harmed. And I don’t know how I got out of that hotel room,” the actress said during her SiriusXM interview. “It always starts with, ‘I’m a healer, I want to massage you’ and all. I sorta screamed my way out…But, the point is that for years, years, we all just shrug it off.”  Concluding, “And because of my experience with Steven Seagal in that room, which was horrific, I refused to meet Harvey Weinstein in his hotel room when another woman brought me, saying ‘you will absolutely get [a screen test].’ “  WATCH: Multiple Women Accuse Movie Mogul Harvey Weinstein of Sexual Harassment as He Announces Leave of Absence  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Margulies emphasized that the discussion of sexual harassment in Hollywood should include the women who enable predatory men. “Who are these women? You know, one of the things I want to stay clear of in this dialogue, collectively with other women and men, is that it’s not always the men that are awful,” Margulies said.  Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct in the past couple weeks by more than 50 women, including multiple allegations of assault. (The movie mogul has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.)  Margulies appeared on Just Jenny along with Erin Merryn, a childhood sexual abuse survivor who is fighting for states to pass Erin’s Law, which mandates schools teach sexual abuse awareness and prevention. The issue of sexual abuse “is not to be shrugged off,” Margulies, a longtime advocate for the law, said on the show. “We have to start with our children.”"
"The clock is ticking for ABC’s ‘American Idol’ reboot to find two more judges to join Katy Perry. We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how producers have their eyes on Selena Gomez to join the show.  It would be pretty awkward to see Taylor Swift‘s BFF Selena Gomez, 25, sitting next to arch-enemy Katy Perry, 32, week after week on American Idol, but the “Fetish” singer is at the top of the show producers’ wish-list for judges. “Producers think that Selena would be great to join the judging panel because she’d bring in a younger crowd for ratings, she’d be considered the nice judge and they would love her to join because the impact she has with social media,” an AI insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Sel is the most followed person on Instagram with a whopping 127 million followers, so of course the show would love to have a judge who can reach so many people.  “They are putting together a proposal for her and are hoping she will accept it and join the show, it’s a long shot but they are taking the chance to get her. They’d love to have her signed up and all judges by mid October,” our insider adds. So far the show has been striking out right and left when it comes to getting other stars to join Katy on the panel. ABC reportedly spent a whopping $25 million to land her back in May, which is over half of the show’s budget. As a result, they don’t have much money left over to get other top names. After all, who wants to do the same job as Katy for a fraction of the paycheck? Especially in Selena’s case, she is the bigger star these days! See pics of beautiful Selena, right here.  If by some chance Selena actually agrees to join the show, they definitely need a “nice” judge cause Katy said she won’t be holding back when it comes to the contestants’ talent. She called in to On Air With Ryan Seacrest on Aug. 23, to give her judging strategy. “I’m going to maybe be more the Simon Cowell. I really respect him. As much as people said, ‘Oh, he’s grumpy or he’s mean,’ he was just truthful, you know? He’s seen it. I don’t need to be there to win the popular race.” She added, “Honestly sob stories come second for me. Everyone has a situation and God bless them…but if you don’t have the goods, you don’t have the goods.” Brutal!    HollywoodLifers, do you think it would be a good career move for Selena to join American Idol? Or would be it be a big step down?"
"Minnie Driver and Matt Damon are reconnecting — but it’s under circumstances that could be better. The Oscar-nominated actress recently took to Twitter to slam her Good Will Hunting co-star about his recent comments about sexual assault.  In the wake of the deluge of sexual misconduct accusations involving Harvey Weinstein and Ben Affleck, two men who Damon has worked closely with, the Downsizing actor spoke to Peter Travers on ABC on Thursday about the cloud of allegations hovering over Hollywood. He pointed out that the men being accused are being put into “one big bucket” and then said that there is a “spectrum of behavior.”  “You know, there’s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right?” he said in the interview. “Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated, right?”  When Driver received word of his comments, she took to Twitter saying, “God God, SERIOUSLY?” From there, she did not hold back and continued to drag Damon and other men who share the same opinions.  “Gosh it’s so interesting how men with all these opinions about women’s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem (profoundly unsurprising),” she tweeted.  Gosh it’s so *interesting how men with all these opinions about women’s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem( *profoundly unsurprising) — Minnie Driver (@driverminnie) December 15, 2017  This was followed by an enormous amount of support from other women. In an interview with the Guardian, Driver said that she felt the need to say something and that men “cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level.”  “I honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can’t tell a woman about their abuse,” continued Driver. “A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it’s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.”  Other women in Hollywood came forward to criticize Damon’s clouded point of view including Alyssa Milano. In a series of tweets, Milano addressed Damon in a series of tweets saying that women are outraged “because we were silenced for so long.” She went on to compare sexual harassment, misconduct, assault, and violence to cancer saying that it is a “systemic disease.” She concluded, “The tumor is being cut out right now with no anesthesia. Please send flowers.”  Dear Matt Damon, It’s the micro that makes the macro. (Thread) — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  We are in a “culture of outrage” because the magnitude of rage is, in fact, overtly outrageous. And it is righteous. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  I have been a victim of each component of the sexual assault spectrum of which you speak. They all hurt. And they are all connected to a patriarchy intertwined with normalized, accepted–even welcomed– misogyny. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  We are not outraged because someone grabbed our asses in a picture. We are outraged because we were made to feel this was normal. We are outraged because we have been gaslighted. We are outraged because we were silenced for so long. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  There are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it’s still cancer. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017"

The 43-year-old daughter of legendary beauty icon Vidal Sassoon announced the news on her Facebook page on Wednesday, telling fans that she’s feels “free & ALIVE to BE the REAL ME that was not shown to the #bravo world of viewers.”  “I truly am #grateful for the experience & huge life lessons I was up against,” she wrote, adding on Twitter that her exit was the “best news EVER!” and that RHOBH was “just a moment in my journey.”  She hashtagged the tweets “#freedom.”  Paul Archuleta/WireImage  Eden had a tough road on RHOBH, where she debuted in season 7 as a friend of Housewife Lisa Rinna.  She opened up early on about her sobriety and the passing of her sister Catya, who died of an overdose in 2002 when she was just 34. But Eden perhaps got a little too personal when she compared he relationship with her sister to the bond between Kyle Richards and her recovering addict sister Kim Richards — causing tension and headed arguments between the three.  RELATED VIDEO: What Eden Sassoon Remembers Most from Tuff Turf Set with Kim Richards & Sister Catya  Things got worse when Rinna told Eden that Kyle was an “enabler” and that Kim was “close to death” — information that propelled Eden into trying to help Kim and Kyle (and, perhaps unfairly, only drove her further away from the group).  By season’s end, Eden had turned on Rinna, telling her, “I’ve given you so much of my time, my energy — my f—ing heart, you bitch! … It’s not okay for you to treat me the way that you do. It’s not okay for you to walk all over me and use me as your scapegoat.

"STOP EVERYTHING! Are Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin already married just 3 weeks after getting engaged? Is that a wedding band? — See the photo that has fans going wild!  Could it be true? — Are Justin Bieber, 24, and Hailey Baldwin, 21, really married just three weeks after getting engaged? While nothing has been confirmed, the proof could be in this picture of JB and Hailey, where she appears to be wearing a diamond wedding band instead of her massive engagement ring. The singer and model were spotted out in New York City on Monday, July 30, when fans noticed she was wasn’t wearing the custom-oval diamond JB proposed with just weeks ago.  The pair put on a PDA show when they stepped out in NYC, however, fans flocked to Hailey’s ring finger. While JB and Hailey haven’t been hiding from cameras since their engagement, this is the first time we’re seeing her without the rock JB proposed with on July 7. Instead, if you take a closer look, you can see what appears to be a diamond wedding band, above a second thick gold band. Have Mr. and Mrs. Bieber been walking around right in front of our eyes? — Take a look at the photo and let us know what you think!

"The Voice features a rotating group of celebrity coaches mentoring up-and-coming talent. Gwen Stefani has played a big part in the show, coaching three seasons: Season 7, Season 9, and most recently Season 12. Her presence on The Voice extends beyond just coaching though. She's performed solo, mentored, and even did a duet with her boyfriend and fellow coach Blake Shelton. So, suffice to say, fans were surprised to hear she wouldn't be returning for Season 13, despite her popularity on the program. So, why isn't Gwen Stefani coaching The Voice Season 13? (Bustle reached out to NBC and Stefani's rep for comment, but has not yet received a response.)  This isn't Stefani's first time stepping away from her red spinning chair; she took a hiatus after Season 9, only to return for Season 12. At the time she took the break, Stefani told Extra she wanted to focus on her career. The Season 9-12 timeout had a clear purpose to it, she wanted to focus on making music and performing. Stefani's reasons for leaving this time are a little less defined, although the multi-night live show is a big commitment for already busy stars.  Minus Stefani, the coaches for Season 13 are Shelton, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Hudson. And, for now, Stefani is keeping busy with music and performances. Stefani is releasing a Christmas duet with Shelton Oct. 6 and is promoting the jingle on her Instagram.  Stefani's love for Shelton is as strong as ever, even without The Voice, and she's been promoting his upcoming album on her social media. In February of 2017, Stefani went on Late Night With Seth Meyers and talked about their musical and romantic unity saying, ""It's so unbelievable ... I love Blake, he's just the most incredible guy. Like, everybody loves Blake ... he's just a sparkly, happy, amazing person.""  According to Stefani's social media, she's also continued to perform her music around the world. She posted the below Instagram on Sept. 15, preforming her classic hit ""Hollaback Girl"" in Korea. She's a seasoned performer and any time not spent coaching on The Voice will likely be spent doing concerts at home and abroad. While The Voice platform is large, the coaches are all successful outside the show as well.  And, maybe Stefani will return for a future season. It's not like she'll stop being involved with The Voice since Shelton remains a coach. Hopefully the opportunity to coach new talent, the fun she seems to have on the program, and the fans will draw her back in at a future time — it's happened before when she left after Season 9 but came back for 12. And, ET reported in May of 2017 that Stefani would love to return to The Voice, but that her future on the show was uncertain. ""I don't have any plans to come back,"" she told the outlet. ""I love being here; I'd love to come back. We'll see what happens next.""  The new season of The Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on NBC. New coaches Cyrus and Hudson should inject a new energy into the program, which will be anchored by longtime coaches Shelton and Levine. And, Hudson not only was a contestant on American Idol, she also was a Voice coach on the UK version of The Voice UK Season 6. So, she has plenty of experience to take Stefani's spot.  The Voice has remained a strong competition show because of its ability to mix things up. Hopefully, the shake-ups continue in the future and put Stefani back in a chair — because going too long without her would be bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s."

The Kendra on Top star took to Instagram Wednesday, when she admitted that she and her husband, Hank Baskett, “are having issues” and denied that their “marital problems” are made up for cameras.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “1. how do u fake marital problems? makes absolutely no sense,” Kendra, 32, began the post, which accompanied a screenshot of an article titled, “Made-Up Marriage Problems?! Kendra’s Faking It for TV.”  “2. Yes we are having issues,” she continued. “3. My job has been reality tv for 13 years 4. My show was a comedy and light hearted til sad times happened then we had to change my show from comedy to drama. Not what i wanted but was a part of my journey and story.”  In a fifth point, Kendra shared that “these issues Hank n I are having in our home which we are tryin to hard to over come, everyone knows about, including producers and network, friends and family.”  “6. My job is reality TV and I love my job unfortunately these issues at home are affecting my decisions cuz the last thing i want to do is hurt Hank,” she shared. “7.

I’ve been in a lot of therapy lately n hope all gets resolved for me, Hank,kids and even for TV. Lol 😂”    The couple wed in 2009 and have welcomed two children — son Hank IV, 8, and daughter Alijah, 3 — over the course of their marriage, which was rocked by a scandal four years ago.  In 2014, Hank allegedly had an affair with a transgender model while Kendra was eight months pregnant. But despite the cheating scandal, the two have remained committed to one another.  “We’re different people than we were years ago,” Kendra told PEOPLE in April 2017. “You know, you change. But you have to change together. You have to grow together, not apart, and that’s the challenge.”  “Right now we’re in the healthiest place we’ve ever been,” she said. “It’s all about each other. We want to help build each other and love each other and make sure we’re happy. When we went through our big issue that was scattered everywhere, it needed to happen.”  “Unfortunately, it was a really rough situation,” she added. “But I’m a very faithful person and I think it really worked out for the best.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kendra’s Ultimatum!

"David Letterman is upping the ante over his obsession with high-stakes poker!  But pals fear that the retired “Late Night” host — who’s already announced a return to television with a new show on Netflix — could have already been putting his original $400 million fortune at risk.  “Dave has rediscovered his love for poker,” dished a source. “He hadn’t played in years, but he’s been getting back into it, and he even started teaching his 13-year-old son, Harry, over the kitchen table. Now Dave wants to take his skills to Las Vegas, where he dreams of winning big!”  Dave, who retired in 2015, has been gearing up to take on A-list poker-playing celebs like Ben Affleck and Tobey Maguire — but he should cool his jets, warned the source.  “Those guys are as close to professional players as you can get,” spilled the source.  “Dave’s totally out of his league with them. He might be worth $400 million, but those guys will have no hesitation in cleaning him out!”  David Letterman: Bald, Bearded & Being A Dad  Dave’s lifelong idol and mentor, late “Tonight Show” icon Johnny Carson, was a legendary poker player who hosted a regular card party at his Malibu home during the 1970s and ’80s.  Dave — who made headlines in 2009 after a $2 million extortion attempt led the married comic to admit to multiple affairs with staffers — insisted his poker playing is not a problem, added the insider.  Yet pals, worried about his decades-long battle with booze, fear Dave could end up flat broke like ‘NYPD Blue’ creator David Milch — who gambled away a staggering $100 million!  “Dave’s trying to enjoy life a little by picking up new hobbies, but gambling isn’t what his old friends had in mind,” tattled the source. “They wish Dave would stick to skiing and fishing. Everyone’s hoping this poker thing is just a phase.”"

"According to In Touch, 20-year-old Kylie is about to get the shock of her life when she finds out that Travis has allegedly been cheating on her for much of their whirlwind six-month relationship.      ‘Travis is cheating on Kylie with a hot 20-something he met while making a music video,” a source spills to the magazine.      In Touch  ‘It’s been going on for a while. Travis says he loves her.      ‘Kylie would die if she found out,’ continues the insider.      ‘Travis is in love, but not with Kylie.’      After exchanging numbers on the set of his video, the rapper is said to have invited the mystery woman to a party at his place, despite the fact Kylie was supposedly already two months pregnant at the time.      And it’s not just a one-time fling, with Travis and the mystery woman quickly becoming emotionally involved.      ‘She’s very exotic and doesn’t have that plastic surgery look like the Kardashian’s have,’ the insider remarks.      However, Travis is still playing the doting baby daddy to Kylie, however insiders suspect that it may have more to do with that fact that he’s set to receive a hefty paycheck if the pair have a televised wedding.      ‘He can’t be that serious with Kylie,” contines the source.      ‘He’s hooking up with another girl! It’s really sad because Kylie wants to make their relationship work.      If she found out the extent of Travis’ infidelity, she’d be crushed.’"
"For other people of this name, see Henry Hall (disambiguation)  Henry Robert Hall, CBE (2 May 1898 – 28 October 1989) was an English bandleader who performed regularly on BBC Radio during the British dance band era of the 1920s and 1930s, through to the 1960s.  Early life and career [ edit ]  Henry Hall was born in Peckham, South London. He won a scholarship to Trinity College of Music where he studied trumpet, piano, harmony and counterpoint.  His first job was as copyist at the head office of the Salvation Army for which he wrote several marches. During World War I, Hall served with the Royal Field Artillery and played trumpet and piano in the regimental band.  Hall's musical career was slow to start but eventually he was engaged by the London Midland and Scottish Railway to take charge of music throughout their then large chain of hotels, including Gleneagles Hotel, where he had previously led the band.  Hall describes in his autobiography, Here's to the Next Time, that on a Thursday in October 1923 he met a young woman named Margery while traveling by rail to Dartmoor. Hall mentions that he and Margery were about the same age and had much in common after discussing the C.B. Cochran production of the musical, ""Little Nellie Kelly"" and Paul Whiteman's take on ""Till My Luck comes Rolling Along"", a tune from the play. The following day, Henry invited Margery to a dance and proposed to her at the end of the evening. By Saturday, just two days after meeting, the two were engaged and were married in January 1924, at St. George's, Hanover Square, London.[1] Henry and Margery had two children during their marriage, Mike and Betty.  In June 1924, on the opening night of the Gleneagles Hotel, Hall persuaded the BBC to broadcast the event on radio, which began his long association with BBC radio.  The 1930s: broadcasting star [ edit ]  It was from Gleneagles that the BBC took him in 1932 to succeed Jack Payne as band leader of the BBC Dance Orchestra.[2] At 5.15pm each weekday, Hall's radio programme from Broadcasting House gathered a huge following across the nation.[3] His signature tune was ""It's Just the Time for Dancing"", and he usually concluded with ""Here's to the Next Time"".  In 1932 he recorded the songs ""Here Comes the Bogeyman"" and ""Teddy Bears' Picnic"" with his BBC Orchestra, featuring singer Val Rosing on vocals. The latter song gained enormous popularity and sold over a million copies. In 1934 his popularity was confirmed when his orchestra topped the bill at the London Palladium.  He featured in the documentary BBC The Voice of Britain (1935), the source of the ""This is Henry Hall speaking"" clip much used in documentaries on this period.  In 1936 Henry Hall made his first feature film and in the same year he was guest conductor of the ship's orchestra on the Queen Mary’s maiden voyage.  In 1937 the BBC Dance Orchestra played at the opening of the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn. The same year Hall left the BBC to tour with his own band, which comprised many members of his BBC band. He toured the halls of Britain and Europe, and generated controversy by dropping songs by Jewish composers while playing in Berlin in February 1938.[4]  Hall's band was the first to appear on television.[citation needed]  Later years [ edit ]  During the Second World War, Hall played for the troops, and gave concerts and shows in factories all over Britain. Many of these concerts came in the form of ""Guest Night"" broadcasts. From June to November, 1943, ""Guest Night"" was replaced by ""Henry Hall's Rhythm Entertainment"" intended to provide radio entertainment for troops overseas.  After the war he developed his show business interests, becoming something of an agent and producer. His BBC work again blossomed as he hosted Henry Hall's Guest Night on the radio and later on television. Hall was also involved in the launch of the television programme Face the Music.[citation needed]  Hall had a son, Michael, who served in the Royal Navy, and a daughter, Betty.  In 1955, Hall published his autobiography Here's to the Next Time. He dedicated it to his wife, Margery.  He ceased regular broadcasting in 1964 and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, CBE, in 1970. He died in Eastbourne, Sussex, in October 1989.  A green memorial plaque on the site of his former home at 8 Randolph Mews, Little Venice, was unveiled on 2 May 1996.[5] A blue plaque commemorates Hall at 38 Harman Drive in Cricklewood, London, where he lived between 1932 and 1959.[6]  Popular culture [ edit ]  Hall unknowingly lent his name to a work shift at Frickley Colliery in South Yorkshire. Miners at the colliery who worked the unpopular night shift referred to the shift as Henry Hall's shift or simply Henry's. This was due to the fact that the shift began at 6pm, the same time as Hall started his show on the radio. When he died, the local football club Frickley Athletic, who had close ties with the colliery, marked the occasion in their matchday programme with a page, dedicated to Hall, entitled ""No More Henry's"".[citation needed]"
"A new trailer for Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World has offered up a first glimpse of Christopher Plummer as billionaire John Paul Getty, following the replacement of Kevin Spacey in the role.  Scott made the decision earlier this month to remove Spacey from the crime drama and replace him with Plummer, after Spacey was accused of multiple instances of sexual misconduct. Despite principal photography for the film having concluded in August, scenes featuring Spacey were reshot at short notice, in order for it to be completed in time for its scheduled US release date of 22 December. The reshoots are said to have cost around $10m, a significant addition to the film’s original $40m budget.  All the Money in the World tells the true story of the kidnapping of Getty’s grandson John Paul Getty III in 1973, and the billionaire’s refusal to pay the ransom. The film stars Michelle Williams as Getty III’s mother Gail Harris and Mark Wahlberg as Fletcher Chase, the former CIA operative who tried to persuade Getty Sr to co-operate with the kidnappers’ demands. Both Wahlberg and Williams are thought to have been involved in the reshoots.  In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Scott said that he made the decision to remove Spacey as soon as he first heard the allegations made against the actor. “I sat and thought about it and realised, we cannot. You can’t tolerate any kind of behaviour like that,” the director said. “And it will affect the film. We cannot let one person’s action affect the good work of all these other people. It’s that simple.”  Police in London are believed to be investigating two claims of sexual assault made against Spacey, who has been accused of misconduct by a number of men. Earlier this week, the Old Vic theatre, which employed Spacey as its artistic director between the years 2004 and 2015, said it had been contacted by 56 people about Spacey, and received 20 allegations of inappropriate conduct. The theatre apologised “wholeheartedly” for failing to create an environment in which people could raise concerns about Spacey’s behaviour. A statement released by Spacey’s former spokeswoman said he was “taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment”.  All the Money in the World is not the only production to have cut ties with Spacey. Last month, Netflix said that it would not release a film in which the actor played Gore Vidal, and had also dropped him from the sixth and final season of its popular drama House of Cards.  All the Money in the World is scheduled for release in the UK on 5 January 2018."
"'This is McCarthyism!': Trump accuses Obama of 'wire-tapping' his office before election  Donald Trump has accused Barack Obama of “wire tapping” his offices in New York City before the presidential election in November, claiming the former president had overseen a “Nixon/Watergate”-style intervention.  Launching a series of tweets at 5.35am eastern time on Saturday, the US president said: “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!”  How Trump lambasted Obama – and Obama trashed Trump Read more  He followed up that initial tweet with a string of others in the following 30 minutes which claimed Obama had defied a court’s rejection of a request to tap his office, and invited a “good lawyer” to make a case against the alleged operation.    Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Is it legal for a sitting President to be ""wire tapping"" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!  The president then compared the alleged surveillance of his communications to Watergate – the scandal in the early 1970s that brought down Republican president Richard Nixon after he ordered a break-in of the Democrat party’s Washington headquarters.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  Trump also made efforts to defend Jeff Sessions, the US attorney general, who is facing questions over his meeting with the Russian ambassador to Washington during the 2016 presidential election campaign.  He tweeted: “The first meeting Jeff Sessions had with the Russian Amb was set up by the Obama Administration under education program for 100 Ambs...” .  He added: “Just out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.”  There was no additional information provided to substantiate the president’s claims that Obama had “wire tapped” Trump Tower, and it was not clear on what information Trump was basing the allegations.  There has been no response to the tweets from Obama.  The Trump administration has been on the back foot over its contacts with Russian officials before the president took office in January.  Last month Michael Flynn was forced to resign as national security adviser over conversations with the Russian ambassador to Washington and misleading statements about them to the press and the vice-president, Mike Pence.  This week it was revealed that Sessions had two meetings with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US, last year twhich he failed to disclose to senators during his confirmation hearing.  Sessions said on Friday that he would recuse himself from investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election despite backing from Trump, who described the controversy as “a total witch hunt”.  Trump’s tweets follow claims made by the conservative radio host Mark Levin on his Thursday night show about the alleged steps taken by the Obama administration to undermine the Republican candidate’s campaign to win the White House.    Donald Trump accuses Obama of orchestrating protests against him Read more  The presenter called the effort a “silent coup” by the Obama administration and called for a congressional investigation into the issue. That contrasts with demands from across the US political spectrum to examine Russian interference in the presidential election.  Levin’s comments were followed up by Breitbart News, the “alt-right” website formerly run by Steve Bannon, who ran the Trump campaign and is now the president’s chief strategist.    The article stated: “The Obama administration sought, and eventually obtained, authorisation to eavesdrop on the Trump campaign; continued monitoring the Trump team even when no evidence of wrongdoing was found; then relaxed the NSA [National Security Agency] rules to allow evidence to be shared widely within the government, virtually ensuring that the information, including the conversations of private citizens, would be leaked to the media.”    The Breitbart story references recent claims that the FBI had asked the foreign intelligence surveillance court for a warrant last year to monitor members of the Trump team suspected of being in contact with Russian officials. The request for the warrant was initially rejected before being granted in October, the reports have said.  Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina, said: “I am very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegally. I would be very worried if, in fact, the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about the Trump campaign activity with foreign governments. It’s my job as a United States senator to get to the bottom of this – I promise you I will.”  The Democratic congressman Seth Moulton, a member of the House armed services and budget committees, told the MSNBC channel: “This is right out of Donald Trump’s reality TV playbook. He’s trying to distract attention from the real story here, which is his campaign, his administration’s contact with Russian officials ... There’s clearly a deeper story here and we the American people need to know how high this conspiracy goes.”  Moulton added: “Obviously contacts with Russian intelligence officials are monitored – that’s part of maintaining our national security. So if under the Obama administration they were simply monitoring contacts with Russian officials – not trying to wiretap into the Trump campaign but simply looking at who Russian officials were talking with – and then Trump campaign officials got ensnared in that net, then it’s a total mischaracterisation to say President Obama was wiretapping Trump.”  Rep Eric Swalwell, a Democrat who is a member of the House intelligence committee, told Fox News that Trump “is not credible when it comes to talking about Russia”.  Swalwell downplayed Trump’s allegations. “I think this is just the president up early doing his routine tweeting, he said. “Presidents don’t wiretap anyone. These are pursued by the Department of Justice in accordance with the FBI and signed off by a judge.”"
"Just hours after the arrest of the alleged Golden State Killer, actor Patton Oswalt — whose late wife, Michelle McNamara, tirelessly investigated the long-cold case and wrote a book on the murders — appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers, opening up about what he said was her “dream.”  “Her book and the article that led to the book really amped up all the interest in the case and really put a lot of focus on this,” Oswalt said. “Not to discredit all the work that the police and the lab technicians did — it was her dream.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  McNamara was a true crime writer and journalist. Oswalt, 49, recalled, “She always said, ‘I don’t care about credit. I want to know that he’s in jail.’ And now he’s caught, the bracelets are on and it feels like this thing that she wanted so badly is now done. It just feels amazing.”  The Golden State Killer — dubbed as such by McNamara — was allegedly linked by DNA and method to 12 murders, 45 sexual assaults and more than 120 burglaries from Sacramento to southern California’s Orange County between 1976 and 1986 in California.  • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

James DeAngelo Sacramento County Sheriff's Office  Suspect Joseph James DeAngelo was arrested on April 24. He is currently charged with capital murder in four killings: the February 2, 1978 slayings of Brian and Katie Maggiore in the Sacramento area, and the March 1980 slayings of Lyman and Charlene Smith in Ventura County.  Police say, however, that they believe he killed many more people.  Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic  McNamara died in her sleep in 2016 at 46. At the time of her death, she had been working on the book. Oswalt promised he would finish the book for her, and earlier this year, the star — who writes the afterword — released I’ll Be Gone in the Dark with the help of other contributors.  “I was still neck deep in grief and suddenly a single father and not sleeping, but I knew that I wouldn’t be able to live and go on with life if this was left undone,” he told Meyers of finishing I’ll Be Gone in the Dark. “I basically begged [the co-authors] and the publishers to find a way and they were the ones to find a way and finish it.”  Earlier in the day, Oswalt reacted to the arrest in a video he shared on Instagram and Twitter.  “One of the more surreal days of my life,” he said. He added while sharing a series of tweets and videos on Twitter and Instagram, “She would be beyond excited about this. I think this is the definition of ‘bittersweet.'”"
"/ Updated By Foluké Tuakli  It was the same-sex kiss heard 'round the world — or at least around television and social media.  In a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit over the weekend, ""Wonder Woman"" star Gal Gadot joined openly gay ""SNL"" cast member Kate McKinnon in a parody of the hit franchise — and a play on the rampant speculation that the film's title character is less-than-heterosexual.  McKinnon and fellow ""SNL"" cast member Aidy Bryant play two self-identified lesbians, Megan and Dre, who are lost at sea and dock their boat on the fictional island nation of Themyscira. The island, home to Wonder Woman, is inhabited solely by women.  “I guess I’ll cut to the chase,"" McKinnon's character says. ""Show of hands: Who all here is a lez?""  When none of the island's inhabitants raise their hands, McKinnon's character shares the frustration of many of the film's fans, exclaiming, ""The whole thing seemed so super gay.""  “It’s like we’re in a porn, but the plumber is genuinely there to fix the pipes,"" Bryant's character says as the island's inhabitants brush each other's hair and play wrestle.  Gadot's character offers to comfort the disappointed duo by conducting an experiment to test her heterosexuality — or lack thereof — with a kiss.  As of Monday afternoon, the YouTube video showing the steamy 14-second kiss between Gadot and McKinnon had more than 2.7 million views. And social media was ablaze with reaction to the skit.  Speculation has long swirled regarding the sexuality of Wonder Woman — also known as Diana Prince— and in 2016, the current writer of the ""Wonder Woman"" comic book series, Greg Rucka, confirmed that she is in fact ""queer.""  Gadot addressed the speculation in an interview with Variety, saying her character is “a woman who loves people for who they are. She can be bisexual. She loves people for their hearts.""  Thousands of fans are petitioning Warner Bros. to embrace Wonder Woman's bisexuality in the sequel to the film studio's blockbuster summer hit, which is set to hit theaters in December 2019.  As of Monday afternoon, a Change.org petition asking the studio to ""make Wonder Woman bisexual"" nearly met its goal of 10,000 signatures.  FOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM"

Justin’s family loves Selena, but Selena’s family has put her in a very conflicting spot because they still don’t trust Justin,” an insider tells Us Weekly exclusively. “Selena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed … but her family just isn’t budging right now.”  The relationship between the “Wolves” singer, 25, and her mother, Mandy Teefy, became rocky when Gomez started seeing Bieber again after undergoing a kidney transplant and recuperating from complications last summer. (She split from The Weeknd in October 2017 after 10 months of dating.) Though the “Sorry” singer, 24, and the 13 Reasons Why executive producer went public with their reunion shortly after, Gomez chose not to bring Bieber along to celebrate Thanksgiving with her family. A source told Us Weekly at the time that Gomez didn’t think her mom in particular “would approve.”  “Her relationship with Justin has really affected her relationship with her mom, and it’s been hard for her because she is super close with her mom. Her mom was her rock when she was having her health complications,” the insider also adds to Us. “Justin and Selena decided to take a break to give her family some more time to heal and take in the idea of her and Justin being a couple again.”  Another source tells Us that another contributing factor to the on-off couple is that Bieber “doesn’t care about anyone but himself.” Adds the source: “The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn’t need him.”  The pair, who have dated off and on since they were first linked in 2011, were last seen leaving church separately on March 8 after vacationing in Jamaica. The couple visited the Caribbean island nation in February for the wedding of Bieber’s father.

"Rapper Rick Ross went on Power 105.1’s The Breakfast Club show recently and was asked why he has never signed a female rapper to his label Maybach Music Group. His excuse? It would just be too easy to have sex with them.  He said:  You know, I never did it because I always thought, like, I would end up fucking a female rapper and fucking the business up... I’m so focused on my business. I just, I gotta be honest with you. You know, she looking good. I’m spending so much money on her photo shoots. I gotta fuck a couple times.  Advertisement  It is unfortunately not surprising that a label exec like Ross would expect sex from the artists he signs (or, in this case, doesn’t sign), especially now when the longstanding misogyny of powerful men in music is becoming more transparent in cases like Dr. Luke, R. Kelly or LA Reid. But Ross’s comments about spending so much money on photo shoots for female artists are particularly interesting.  The number of female rappers signed to major labels has been steadily dropping since the 1980s. When NPR interviewed MC Lyte—the first woman with a solo rap record on a major label—about this topic in 2014, one of the reasons she offered for the decline was the fact that signing women is risky because of the costs that add up concerning their looks: hair, makeup, photo-shoots.  And this has long been the excuse. “That’s why labels only release a new female MC every few years,” former Vibe editor-in-chief Mimi Valdes said in 2007. “They’re just too damn expensive!”  Advertisement  “Women are viewed differently because we cost more money, number one,” Nicki Minaj’s former manager Debra Antney told Vice in 2014. “A guy could look like Cyclopes’ twin and get up there and make it. He just throws on a T-shirt and some jeans and he’s fly. For us, it’s the whole glam squad—the hair, the makeup—all these things that you have to have.”  The whole thing just seems like a snake eating its own tail: you have to be professionally gorgeous to be a successful rapper, but then your gorgeousness apparently makes your male bosses want to have sex with you, and then that’s bad for your career. Seems like a good way around this would be to see women rappers as actual artists with agency?"
"Selena Gomez reportedly walked out on Justin Bieber during their date night in Seattle.  A source told E! News that Gomez disliked the fact that Bieber’s dancing drew too much attention. Immediately after Gomez walked out of the venue, Bieber followed her, and they both returned to Los Angeles together.  The couple rode a private jet over the weekend to enjoy some quality time together. Another source told the same publication that the two are doing great ever since they started seeing each other again in October.  “Selena and Justin are doing great. Justin is very affectionate to Selena. He wears his heart on his sleeve lately especially when it comes to her. They are still learning about each other as grown adults,” the source said.  The same source claimed that Bieber and Gomez will be spending New Year’s Eve together since they won’t be able to celebrate Christmas together. However, nothing has been finalized as of late.  Another source told People last week that Gomez’s family doesn’t like Bieber for the “Wolves” singer that’s why she never invites him to attend their gatherings.  “Justin’s family always loved Selena, but Selena’s family is still not happy about her seeing Justin. Selena doesn’t bring Justin to any family events. Selena is spending Christmas with her family. As of now, Justin is not invited,” the source said.  Gomez and Bieber dated on and off from 2010 to 2015. The two rekindled their romance after she underwent kidney transplant. Following her split from The Weeknd, Bieber and Gomez started hanging out more frequently. Last month, they were also photographed kissing each other on the lips.  While speaking with Billboard, Gomez also said that she’s more mature now to know who is good for her.  “I cherish people who have really impacted my life. So maybe before, it could have been forcing something that wasn’t right. But that doesn’t mean caring for someone ever goes away. And that goes for people in general,” she said."

"Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have split after two and a half years of marriage — and seven years as a couple.  “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,” says a statement released by longtime Aniston publicist Stephen Huvane. “This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.  “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another. ”  The couple announced that they split at the end of the last year, however, they celebrated the New Year together with their annual vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico alongside a handful of close pals including Jason Bateman and his family.  Pharrell and Jennifer Aniston at Ellen DeGeneres' birthday.  The two spent quite a bit of time apart in recent months raising questions. Theroux was often spotted in New York City away from their L.A. home. They have also had a busy year as Aniston signed on with Reese Witherspoon for a new Apple TV series and filmed Dumplin’ in Atlanta, while Theroux, 46, filmed the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me in Budapest.  On Saturday, Aniston made an appearance at Ellen DeGeneres‘ birthday party without Theroux. She was spotted standing outside the Hollywood venue chatting with Pharrell.  The next day, the actress rang in her 49th birthday without the actor. Aniston celebrated in Malibu, California with a gathering including pals Courteney Cox, Andrea Bendewald, Leigh Kilton-Smith and Kristin Hahn on Sunday.  Theroux, meanwhile, was spotted out in New York City on Friday walking his dog. (Last year, the duo vacationed together in Los Cabos, Mexico with friends).  Justin Theroux walks his dog in N.Y.C. days before Jennifer Aniston's birthday. Splash News Online  Sources recently told PEOPLE that their busy schedules worked for both of them and helped their marriage.  “Justin often spends a few days in NYC by himself,” a source previously told PEOPLE. “When he is in NYC, Jen will catch up with friends and enjoys her own life. When Justin is in L.A., it’s very special for them. They socialize together with friends. They often go out to dinner or have people over.”  Aniston showed off the $21 million L.A. home they designed together in the March issue of Architectural Digest, saying, “I look around at my husband and my dogs and our home, and there’s nowhere else I want to be.”  Aniston and Theroux first met on the Hawaii set of 2008’s Tropic Thunder and began dating in 2011. They later married in a surprise and secret ceremony on August 5, 2015 — just a few days before Theroux’s 44th birthday. A source close to the actress told PEOPLE at the time that the two were happy to have pulled off the surprise wedding, inviting friends to a backyard party under the ruse of celebrating Theroux’s birthday.  RELATED: Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux Were the Picture Perfect Couple During Their Last Vacation  “They seemed ecstatic,” the source said. “They celebrated late and barely slept, but they were in the best mood. They were giddy to have pulled off an amazing wedding celebration with their friends. And they were proud to finally be married.”  Aniston was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005 after starting their relationship in 1998. She later dated Vince Vaughn and John Mayer after her divorce from Pitt.  This is Theroux’s first marriage after previously dating hair stylist Heidi Bivens for 14 years before their breakup in 2011, shortly before he started dating Aniston. Theroux and Bivens shared an apartment in New York City before the split."

"For Khloé Kardashian’s 34th birthday, Kim Kardashian mended her relationship with Tristan Thompson. Kim begged the Cleveland Cavaliers player to unblock her on Instagram while attending Khloé’s party on Wednesday, June 27.  “All right, guys. So, what do you think? It’s Khloé’s birthday. Do you think I should ask this guy to unblock me?” the KKW Beauty founder, 37, said in a series of hilarious videos shared on her Instagram Story while sitting next to Thompson, 27, who blocked her on the social media app after she spoke out about his cheating scandal.  “For Khloé’s birthday, I think it’s only right. I got you,” the athlete replied with a laugh. The birthday girl then implored her boyfriend of nearly two years to “do it right now.”  When Thompson pulled out his iPhone, Kim jokingly asked for his passcode. “[Khloé] knows it,” he responded before opening Instagram and going to Kim’s profile. The Selfish author zoomed in on the NBA star as he counted down and then tapped the “Unblock” button. He quipped, “There’s no going back now,” to which Kim replied, “Now the question is, should I follow you again?”  The social media mogul was shocked to find out that Thompson also blocked Khloé’s best friends Malika and Khadijah Haqq. “Wait, you guys! Did you know he blocked you also?” she asked the 35-year-old twins, who were sitting nearby. As all of the guests collectively freaked out, Kim demanded silence and shouted, “This is a birthday party!”  As previously reported, Thompson blocked Kim in late April after she said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that it was “so f–ked up” that he cheated on Khloé while she was pregnant with the couple’s daughter, True. “Last time I went on TV and answered some questions about [Khloé], I got blocked on social media. And not from Khloé,” Kim revealed on Live With Kelly and Ryan on May 11.  True, now 2 months, was born just days after the basketball pro (who is also the father of son Prince, 18 months, with ex Jordan Craig) was caught making out and getting cozy with other women.  A source recently told Us Weekly exclusively that the Good American designer and her beau are still working out their issues. “Tristan is a part of Khloé’s life,” the insider said. “They are together. … They’re continuing to work on their relationship.”  For the latest TV news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast Watch With Us below!

"An object example of how a film can be entertaining and even exhilarating without being particularly good, “Bohemian Rhapsody” has the driving energy of a stadium anthem and the fizzy meaninglessness of a bubblegum pop song.  As a biopic of flamboyantly theatrical gay frontman Freddie Mercury, the movie frequently falls short, but it does provide interesting origin stories for many of the hits created by Mercury’s band Queen. Wisely, the movie wraps everything up with a rousing recreation of Queen stealing the show at 1985’s Live Aid, providing the equivalent of a band making you forget a mediocre set by performing a dazzling encore. The end of “Bohemian Rhapsody” marks the first (and no doubt last) time that I was brought to tears by “Radio Gaga.”  Very much an “authorized” biopic — band members Brian May and Roger Taylor are credited as “Executive Music Producers” — the film is a rather rote road-to-stardom tale: In 1970, a Heathrow baggage handler named Freddie Bulsara (Rami Malek) meets dental student Roger (Ben Hardy, “Only the Brave”) and astrophysics student Brian (Gwilym Lee, “Midsomer Murders”) and informs them that they need to make him their lead singer. Add bassist John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello, “G.I. Joe: Retaliation), and Queen is born.  Watch Video: 'Bohemian Rhapsody': Rami Malek Is the Champion of the World in Trailer for Freddie Mercury Biopic  The group quickly gets label attention, due mainly to the vocal chops and stage presence of their lead singer, who has redubbed himself “Freddie Mercury,” much to the chagrin of his Parsi parents. Queen battles with EMI over the “A Night at the Opera” album, particularly over “Bohemian Rhapsody,” which gives the eponymous film one of its most rapturous segments, as the band pieces together this complicated, elaborate, genre-defying pop single. (The casting of Mike Myers as BMI exec Ray Foster is amusing, given the connection between the song and “Wayne’s World,” but the movie overplays its hand by having Foster say that kids in cars will never bang their heads to the song.)  In his personal life, we see Freddie fall for Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton, “Sing Street”), to whom he would propose, compose love songs for, and repeatedly refer to as the love of his life. But when Queen goes on the road, Freddie enjoys a series of quick and anonymous liaisons with men. Upon his return, she confronts him about the cracks in their marriage; “I think I’m bisexual,” he finally confesses, which Mary shuts down with a firm: “Freddie. You’re gay.”  Also Read: Bryan Singer Preemptively Denies Accusations About Him in Upcoming Esquire Article  There was concern in some quarters that the film would tamp down Mercury’s homosexuality, and to its credit, it’s right there on screen from the get-go. (Moments before he catches Mary’s eye for the first time, he cruises a handsome young man.) And for a movie that literally opens with an HIV-positive Mercury coughing — letting us know early that subtlety will not be on the menu — the film does handle its protagonist’s issues with AIDS-related complication respectfully, if fleetingly.  It’s worth noting, however, that “Bohemian Rhapsody” also goes out of its way to create a hissable gay villain: manager Paul Prenter (Allen Leech, “Downton Abbey”), presented here as an old-school Devious Queen, all but twirls his ’70s-clone mustache as he drives a wedge between Freddie and the band, leading to an unsuccessful solo career and a schism that will have to be healed in time for Live Aid, even though most biographical accounts of Queen seem to suggest that this parting and reuniting is pure fiction. (Mercury’s first solo album under his own name didn’t come out until 1985, the year that Live Aid took place.)  The film offers interesting glimpses into how hits like “We Will Rock You” and “Another One Bites the Dust” came to be, while leaving out other moments that fans might want to see, from triumphs (“Flash Gordon,” recording “Under Pressure” with David Bowie, opera-lover Mercury’s duet with legendary diva Monserrat Caballé) to debacles (“Body Language”). Screenwriter Anthony McCarten is no stranger to biopic contrivance (he previously wrote “Darkest Hour” and “The Theory of Everything”), but he outdoes himself in the third act of “Bohemian Rhapsody,” in which disparate emotional arcs in Freddie’s life are all resolved en route to Wembley for Live Aid. Here’s hoping that chauffeur got a hefty tip for all that dramatic reconciliation.  Also Read: 'Venom,' 'Bohemian Rhapsody' Among Most Anticipated Fall Movies, Fandango Survey Finds  But admittedly, that Live Aid sequence so thrillingly captures what is considered both a high point in live rock performance and a historical moment in Queen’s career that it justifies making and seeing the movie. Malek doesn’t always nail the off-stage Mercury — he struggles with the dental prosthetic he’s been given to match the singer’s legendary overbite, as though it had been thrust into his mouth for the first time seconds before cameras were rolling — but with a microphone in his hand and lip-synching to Mercury’s vocals, Malek captures the electricity of a rock god at the height of his powers. It’s a moment where everything the movie has to offer and everyone who worked on it — particularly cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel (“Drive”) and editor John Ottman (“X-Men: Days of Future Past”) — are firing on all cylinders.  As an inducement to dig into the Queen back catalog, “Bohemian Rhapsody” is an unqualified success. But when it tries to be a genuine biopic of a groundbreaking band and its singular lead singer, it’s more like a little silhouette-o of a man.  ﻿"

"There’s reportedly trouble in paradise at the Kardashian West house. Kim’s allegedly ready to divorce Kanye! What happened?  This is so sad! Kim Kardashian, 37, is reportedly at her wits end when it comes to dealing with husband Kanye West, 40. She’s struggled since Kanye’s terrifying November 2016 breakdown, and she reportedly can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, according to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine. “Between his raging ego and mood swings, Kanye has been a total train wreck,” the insider alleged to the Star. “Kim is stressed enough raising two kids and getting ready for the baby without Kanye dragging her down. She’s tried to hang in there, but she just can’t take it anymore.”  Poor Kim! We can’t imagine how hard it must be to have a family member — especially your husband — go through such a huge health scare. Of course she’s stressed! If they’re truly divorcing, things are about to get crazy. She allegedly doesn’t want to make any moves until after their third baby, which they’re having via surrogate, is born. As the source says, she’s totally fine raising the little one as a single mother. She’s Kim effing Kardashian!  “[Their divorce] will be all-out war,” the insider told Star. Kim has reportedly asked Kanye to sign a “mid-nuptial agreement” to protect her assets. Factoring in their revenue, from Kanye’s music, the KUWTK empire, and Kim’s various deals, including KKW beauty, it could be a $1 billion divorce!  Don’t think she’s happy about this, though. “This decision is agony for her,” the source said. “She still loves Kanye, but their marriage may be over!” This is so sad, considering what we just learned from a source. Kim and Kanye were happily including daughter North West in the conversation about her new little sister, the source told us EXCLUSIVELY. If they’re truly having problems, then at least they’re putting on a united front for their little ones.  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Kim’s rep for comment.

"Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian. Reuters  Being married to 23-time Grand Slam tennis champion Serena Williams is like a ""front row seat to greatness,"" according to her husband Alexis Ohanian.  Ohanian, an internet entrepreneur, said in an interview with Fox Business that he always presumed ""tech was the hardest working industry.""  But, after speaking with Williams, Ohanian quickly changed his mind.  ""I really thought I was like the hardest working person I knew,"" he said. ""I thought tech was the hardest working industry. Our businesses are open 24/7 and, of course, we're always working and grinding. But then I started talking to her and then realised, very quickly, just how wrong I was.""  Ohanian co-founded the news website Reddit in 2005 and became a multi-millionaire aged 23 when he sold it 16 months later. He met Williams at a cafe in Italy in 2015 and improved the tennis ace's website with a superior ""tech strategy"" while also helping secure ""deal flows with sponsorships and investments.""  The pair got married in 2017 and Ohanian said Williams has inspired him in business.  ""It's a front row seat to greatness and that is what I'm working towards in my own career,"" he said.  Ohanian and Williams had a daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., in September last year. Since then, Williams has returned to tennis and almost captured her first major since being a mom, what would have been her 24th Grand Slam title, when she reached the 2018 Wimbledon Championships final — but she missed out to Angelique Kerber.  Ohanian co-founded Initialized Capital in 2010, is an Open Internet activist (an advocate for net neutrality), and is widely regarded as ""one of the most creative people in business."""

"When you collect together Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo, Mark Mothersbaugh, and director Taika Waititi, there’s no way you can make a bad movie. And judging by a new behind the scenes video released by Marvel, Thor: Ragnarok looks every bit as good as we expected.  “Ragnarok is a new cycle; new realms, new universe,” explains Waititi. “It’s the destruction of the old and the rebirth of the new, and that’s really exciting to me. The way that I’ve approached this is to rebuild it in a new way.”  As we’ve seen from the posters and trailers, the tone of Thor: Ragnarok is completely different from the first two Thor movies, which were dark and brooding. It was a conscious choice by the cast and crew, one that mixes action and humor—sort of using the Guardians of the Galaxy approach.  If you’ve ever seen Waititi’s other work—I highly recommend Hunt for the Wilderpeople—the director seems like the perfect person to usher in this new version of Thor. If you want a taste of Waititi’s brand of humor, look no further than the “Team Thor” shorts he made about what Thor was up to during the events of Captain America: Civil War.  “What are the odds we survive this trip,” Thor asks Bruce Banner.  “I’d say the odds are a million to fun,” Banner retorts.  Thor: Ragnarok hits theaters on November 3."

"Mila Kunis has no problem blocking out the tabloid noise that gets written about her and her family.  “I don’t read anything about myself,” Kunis told Cosmopolitan. “I genuinely don’t know what’s written about me … other than I know that I’m pregnant about once a year and my husband and I are getting a divorce once a year. I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I’m like, Oh boy, OK!”  Her relatives, however, can’t shake it all off quite as easily as “The Spy Who Dumped Me” star because they’ve often thought some headlines were true.  “The only thing that’s upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,” she shared. “At one point when I was pregnant, [the tabloids] said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover.  “The amount of stress that caused my family,” she said, “nobody will understand.”  On a lighter note, Kunis, who is a mom to 3-year-old daughter Wyatt and 1-year-old son Dimitri with husband Ashton Kutcher, revealed that her dad always hopes the pregnancy headlines are true.  “He’s always like, ‘Is there really another?'”"
"After two high-risk pregnancies, Kim Kardashian West took a different route for baby no. 3, whom she welcomed in January 2018, with Kanye West: surrogacy.  The news comes hot on the heels of the last season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which explored the reality star’s desire to have another child despite the significant health challenges she faces.  Already mother to daughter North, 4½, and son Saint, 2, here’s a look back at what Kardashian West, 37, has said about wanting to expand her family in recent years.  Want all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs? Click here to get those and more in the PEOPLE Babies newsletter.  A Pregnancy Scare  In May 2016, just five months after Saint was born, Kardashian West bought three pregnancy tests and took one in a cramped airplane bathroom during a flight, taking to Snapchat to share the experience with her fans.  Kim Kardashian/Snapchat  “I’m legit in the airplane bathroom taking a pregnancy test because I’m having a little bit of a scare,” she said in one video.  After her frantic message, the star snapped a pic of the clear “not pregnant” result.  Kim Kardashian/Snapchat  The next day, Kardashian West took to Snapchat yet again, this time to explain her decision to document the experience.  “Let’s discuss,” she started. “Some people were asking me why I would Snapchat the pregnancy test on the airplane. And I just thought it was funny, because I’ve been so private before — and what do I really care if I was pregnant again?”  “I didn’t get my period this month, so I was just really confused,” she added. “And I couldn’t stand to be on a flight for 10 hours not knowing.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West Is Trying for a Third Baby — But Doctors Warn It’s Not Safe  Exploring Other Options  A few months later, in a November 2016 episode of KUWTK, Kardashian West broached the possibility of having someone else carry her third child.  Kardashian West then met with two fertility specialists, including Dr. Wong, who was on board with the option considering the medical risks of a third pregnancy for the star.  “Using a surrogate is not an unreasonable option,” he said. “If our goal is to grow your family like you want to, then a surrogate makes sense.”  “If the two doctors that I trust have told me it wouldn’t be safe for me to get pregnant again, I have to listen to that,” said Kardashian West. “But because I don’t know anyone that has been a surrogate or used one, I didn’t really think about that as an option for me.”  Kim Kardashian West/Instagram  At sister Kourtney Kardashian‘s suggestion, Kardashian west met with a woman named Natalie who had both carried a pregnancy herself and used a surrogate.  “I’m more worried because I gave birth to two [children] — there’s a sense in me that because I went through all that pain for these two babies and that I know we did this together … There’s no one that would feel your love [like that],” she said. “They are literally near your heart and inside of you.”  “My bond with my kids is so strong,” she continued. “I think my biggest fear if I had a surrogate is: Would I love them the same? That’s the main thing I keep thinking about.”  Natalie reassured the star that the bond is just as strong, and Kardashian West sat down with momager Kris Jenner to discuss the news.  “So I’ve come to the conclusion that I can’t carry another one,” she said. “I want to explore surrogacy.”  “That scares me for you,” said Jenner. “What if she gives birth and then grabs the baby and makes a run for it?”  “I don’t think she can,” said Kardashian West. “Also, the best thing is I could have a new baby and have no one know and live my life for a good year before we announce it.”  FROM PEN: Katherine Heigl Reveals the Emotional Way She Told Her Daughters She Was Pregnant  Baby Fever Hits Hard  In an April episode of the most recent season of KUWTK, the reality star revealed that she and West, 40, are trying to conceive again despite their challenging pregnancies.  “I want my kids to have siblings, but the doctors don’t feel like it’s safe for me,” she said, telling sister Kourtney and Khloé Kardashian that she’s “going to try to have one more baby.”  “I’d love nothing more than to expand my family and just know that I have this world at home that’s safe,” she said. “And if for some reason I left this earth sooner than I really wanted to, then my kids would have a support system at home — so that I know that they would be okay if I wasn’t here.”  “Kanye and I have always talked about having more kids,” she admitted. “But after what I went through in Paris, the urgency is even greater.”  At the time, Kardashian West and her husband had been working hard on their relationship, having finally settled into a good place after enduring a period of marital strain sparked by her Paris robbery last October, followed swiftly by the rapper’s hospitalized for exhaustion in November.  “Everyone knows she had major medical complications during her other two pregnancies,” a source told PEOPLE. “But whenever things are going great with Kanye, Kim talks about having another baby.” (The insider also acknowledged that a third baby would be “a great storyline for the show.”)  Source: Kim Kardashian Instagram  Getting Serious About Surrogacy  In the same April KUWTK episode, Kardashian West underwent a procedure in an attempt to help her become able to carry another child — but it wasn’t successful.  “I can’t carry anymore kids … it’s the worst,” she confessed. “I give up.”  As a result, the star decided it was time to revisit the option of hiring a surrogate.  “Kanye was really nervous about the surgery … but I know he would want to have more kids,” she said. “I feel like surrogacy is the only option for me. Kanye and I are going to look into other options and see what we are comfortable with … but I’m definitely leaning towards [surrogacy].”  “I always knew surrogacy was an option — now it’s my reality,” she eventually concluded. “Whatever is meant to be will be.”  A Plan in Motion  In June 2017, a source confirmed to PEOPLE that the stars had hired a surrogate. TMZ was the first to report the news.  It’s a Girl!  The soon-to-be mother of three told host Ellen DeGeneres that her 4-year-old daughter North had taken to calling the unborn child, “Baby Sister” during an October 2017 appearance on the talk show. “My daughter thinks she’s tricky,” Kardashian West said. “We had a baby shower over the weekend, and I thought, ‘You know, I really do want to have a baby shower because I want [North] to feel that something’s coming and for her to really understand it.’ ”  A New Experience  While she was excited to share the news with the rest of the Kardashian crew, Kardashian West admitted the situation felt different than when she was pregnant the first two times. “It’s kind of weird when it’s not you, so I don’t know whether I should start eating donuts and celebrate like I would like old times or just go to the gym,” Kardashian West told sister Kourtney on a December 2017 episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. “I’m totally gonna forget and then a month before I’m gonna be like holly sh—, we need to get a nursery.”  She’s Here!  The couple’s second daughter has arrived via surrogate, Kardashian West shared via her website on January 16, 2018. The baby girl was born Jan. 15, at 12:47 a.m., weighing 7 lbs., 6 oz. “Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,” she wrote in a post titled ‘She’s Here!’.  “We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care.”"
"HOUSTON -- Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt will pay for the funerals of those killed in the shooting at Santa Fe High School on Friday morning.  Ten people were killed and 10 more wounded after a 17-year-old carrying a shotgun and revolver opened fire at the high school about 30 miles from downtown Houston.  According to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, nine of the victims were students. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called the shooting ""one of the most heinous attacks that we've ever seen in the history of Texas schools.""  According to police officials, the 17-year-old is in custody and has been charged with capital murder and a second person has been detained.  Shortly after the shooting, Watt tweeted, ""Absolutely horrific.""  Watt has been active in the surrounding community since he was drafted by Houston in 2011. Most notably, he started a fundraiser last August that raised more than $37 million for those affected by the flooding from Hurricane Harvey.  The Texans also released a statement.  ""On behalf of the Texans organization, we are saddened by the tragic events at Sante Fe High School this morning and extend our thoughts and heartfelt condolences to the victims, their families and all those affected.

"He's used to fans falling over themselves at his every word.  But Justin Bieber came unstuck on Sunday at the BST Hyde Park concert with a shaky performance which left a packed crowd baffled.  During his set, the pop singer revealed he had stuck vapour rub up his nose before getting into a funk when a joke he cracked was met with a stony silence - leaving the singer to quip: 'I'm having a bad night don't judge me.'  Scroll down for video  Justin Bieber came unstuck on Sunday at the BST Hyde Park concert with a nightmare performance which left a packed crowd scratching their heads.  And things went from bad to worse when he publicly scolded his backing singers for talking in-between songs, sneering: 'Whatever you're talking about can't be more important than what I'm saying,' leaving his audience stunned.  The problems began early when the Sorry hit-maker pointed out the Merry-go-round near the stage and joked: 'That looks fun... Said no one ever!'  Sadly, the discerning British crowd failed to see the funny side of Bieber's wisecrack leaving him to awkwardly tap his microphone and quip: 'Is this thing on?' before adding: 'Tough crowd!'  In the singer's defense, it appears as if he was nursing a cold.  Bad night at the office: During the botched performance, the pop singer revealed he had vapour rub stuck up his nose before getting into a huff when a joke he cracked was met with a stony silence  Whoops: Bieber told the crowd 'I'm having a bad night, don't judge me'  Explaining to fans that he was bunged up and had to use Vicks Vapour in order to perform.  'I usually use Olbus oil' he told the confused audience. 'But I had to use Vicks here and now and it's stuck up my nose,' he continued.  Finally adding: 'I'm having a bad night, don't judge me.'  Dressed in a red Louis Vuitton X Supreme baseball shirt, the singer donned a pair of loose fittign basketball shorts and Adidas trainers in order to aid his usually upbeat performance.  Previous form: In 2016 he stormed off stage in Manchester when fans refused to storm screaming when he sang  Angry: 'People tend to want to shut you down. What I mean by that is … people try to twist things, some people don't want to listen'  Doubling down: In a later post on Instagram he reiterated his point, writing 'People tend to want to shut you down. What I mean by that is … people try to twist things'  Another look: Justin later made an outfit change as he took to the stage at BST Hyde Park  Professional: Despite his prior performance, Justin continued to be in the zone as he belted out his hit tunes  The Sorry artist has form when it comes to hit and miss gigs.  In 2016 he stormed off stage in Manchester when fans refused to storm screaming when he sang.  Scolding the crowd, he said: 'Just try to show me you love me, in a different way. I get it. The screaming is just so obnoxious. I get it, it's been in our blood and it's been grand, you go to a concert and scream and stuff.  'But if we could just ... scream after the song, enjoy the songs ... the screaming is awesome, it's fine, and then we take a chill pill for a second and we just listen to me speak.  'Because ... I don't feel like I'm being heard sometimes and it's getting a little pressuring. So, if when I'm speaking you guys could not scream at the top of your lungs. Is that cool with you guys?'  In a later post on Instagram he reiterated his point, writing: 'People tend to want to shut you down. What I mean by that is … people try to twist things, some people don't want to listen.  'But I simply feel like, if I didn't use this platform to say how I truly feel, and if I didn't use this platform to be the man that I know I am, and speak from what's in my heart, then I'm doing myself injustice, and I'm not doing anybody in this audience any justice.  'There's going to be times where I say the wrong thing, because I'm human. But I don't pretend to be perfect and I hope to God that, you know, I don't say the right thing all the time because if that was the case then I'd be a robot, and I'm just, I'm not a robot.'  Fashionable: Justin donned a tight white vest top and a funky Supreme printed shirt  Dream team: Justin was joined by a bevy of back-up dancers on stage  Down to earth: He once again got comfortable on the floor  Shielding himself: The glare of the sunset got too much for Justin and he donned a pair of shades  Sitting: He looked very much at ease as he relaxed on the floor  In the moment: Justin was clearly feeling the energy of his back-up dancers as he performed up a storm"
"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star says goodbye to her Pomeranian  By Catalina Barrios  It’s incredible how attached we become to our pets. The relationship builds slowly over time as we share moments of laughter, sadness, and quiet companionship. The memories shared with a dog will be unforgettable. Even though you know from the start that you will outlive your furry friend, the day your dog dies will be one of the hardest of your life.  Over the past year, there have been so many celebrity pet losses. With each one, our hearts have ached.  Lisa Vanderpump, of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills was in tears in a recent episode. The reason for this was the loss of her adorable Pomeranian, “Pink Dog”. The reality star is known for her passion for the color pink as much as for her dedication to serving dog charities. Pink Dog regularly had her white fur tinted pink with food coloring.  Credit: Bravo / The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills  During the episode, Lisa met with her friends, animal activists Kyle Richards and Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave, to talk about Pink Dog’s passing. The Pomeranian was approximately 5-years old and died suddenly, last September, from a heart attack.  “We are devastated to see you go so suddenly…you were such a happy dog and we will miss you so much. We love you,” said Lisa after her Pomeranian passed away.  Lisa tells Kyle and Teddi: “Pink Dog was a happy, little, pink dog. And she just had a heart attack and died. My dogs are like my little furry children. I don’t want to cry. Can we stop now?”  Lisa said her husband, Ken Todd, tried to save the pooch by giving CPR, but it was too late.  Credit: Facebook / Vanderpump Dogs  The Vanderpump Rules star has more than 25 pets including Giggy, a Pomeranian and frequent costar, and Schnooky, the LoveDog. She also has turtles, swans and mini horses.

"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Ree Hines  There's good news for former ""Bachelorette"" Emily Maynard and husband Tyler Johnson — and it's familiar news: They're expecting a baby!  Just last year, the couple, who married in 2014, made a similar announcement. Now, eight months after welcoming a baby boy named Jennings, there's another bundle of joy on the way.  ""Some might say I’m crazy. Some might call me a glutton for punishment. I’d say I’m a little bit of both,"" Maynard wrote in a blog post for People.com. ""But more than anything, I’m just so excited for this summer to get here. Why you ask? Well … I’m pregnant. Again.""  Maynard said that she realized that she'd given birth to Jennings ""like, two seconds ago,"" and added, ""I guess I should’ve read that part in the baby handbook that says you’re super fertile after giving birth, huh?""  But unexpected or not, she and Johnson couldn't be happier about their growing family.  ""I said about two weeks after Jennings was born that I couldn’t wait to have another,"" Maynard explained. ""I just had no clue it would happen so quickly! Some of my closest friends have had a really hard time getting pregnant and my heart breaks for them, so I’m just so grateful for this blessing God has given our family.""  This will be the third child for Maynard, who also has a 10-year-old daughter, Ricki, from her relationship with late NASCAR driver Ricky Hendrick.  So much has changed in Maynard's life over the past few years. In 2011, she received the final rose from Brad Womack on Season 15 of ""The Bachelor."" But months after the finale, they parted ways.

But despite another seemingly happy ending with contestant Jef Holm, they too broke off their engagement.  In 2013, she met now-husband Johnson.  ""I’m living proof that God has an incredible plan for each of us, we just have to be patient enough to wait for Him and His timing!"" she wrote.  Follow Ree Hines on Twitter."
"Felicity Jones married her movie director boyfriend of three years Charles Guard on Saturday.  The ceremony took place at Sudeley Castle, near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire in England, with the star opting to wear a 'budget' dress.  The couple's big day celebration had an impressive guest list, with A-list celebs including the bride's The Theory of Everything co-star Eddie Redmayne, 36, and Tom Hanks, 61.  Finally hitched: Felicity Jones, 34, married her boyfriend of three years Charles Guard, 45, on Saturday in their native England in a secret ceremony (pictured in 2017)  According to The Sun, the bride wore an elegant full-sleeved white gown with sheer fabric above the bust and a frilled neck.  Felicity, who also starred in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, made a speech at the ceremony.  Wearing an expression of utter delight, she slicked her wavy dark hair back beneath a classic mesh veil that fell to the floor.  Meanwhile, her groom, 45, cut a dapper figure in a three-piece suit with silver trousers, a black jacket and a pale yellow waistcoat.  A day in the Cotswolds: The ceremony took place at Sudeley Castle, a spectacular structure near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire in England  Rounding off the look with a sky blue tie over a white dress shirt, he popped a flower in his lapel for his special day.  The majestic venue is the only private castle in England to have a queen buried within its grounds, Katherine Parr, the last of Henry VIII’s six wives.  It closed its grounds early to the public on Saturday to accommodate the wedding.  The newlyweds have mostly managed to keep out of the public eye since they began dating three years ago.  Historic: The majestic venue is the only private castle in England to have a queen buried within its grounds, Katherine Parr, the last of Henry VIII’s six wives  Special day: It closed its grounds early to the public on Saturday to accommodate the wedding  Spellbinding venue: It is being said that Felicity, who also starred in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, made a speech at the ceremony  The movie director popped the question in May 2017 after just two years of dating.  He is best known for the 2009 horror film The Uninvited, which he co-directed with his brother, Thomas Guard.  Before the Hollywood actress dated Guard, Felicity, 34, was with a sculptor named Ed Fornieles.  They were together for ten years. and had met while they were both attending the University of Oxford  Wedding details: The newlyweds have mostly managed to keep out of the public eye since they began dating three years ago  Epic guest list: Some of their A-list guests that watched on included the bride's The Theory of Everything co-star Eddie Redmayne, 36, and Tom Hanks, 61  A-list: Eddie Redmayne was one of the guests at the wedding (he and Felicity starred together in The Theory Of Everything)  Friends in high places: Tom Hanks was also a guest at the wedding  Details about the bride's infamous wedding outfit remain under lock and key but it’s unlikely Jones wore a budget dress, like she did when she first attended the BAFTAs in 2011.  The British beauty admitted that when she was invited to the British Academy Film & Television Awards for the first time shortly after winning a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival for her work in indie movie Like Crazy, she was totally unprepared for the glamorous event.  Instead of breaking the bank to purchase an expensive couture gown, she sourced her dress from a second-hand store.  She even did her makeup in her brother’s bathroom before the ceremony.  Flashback: Felicity, pictured left, and her wedding guest attendee co star Eddie, pictured right, are seen dancing together in their 2014 film The Theory of Everything"
"Meghan Markle has gone from being portrayed as just another one of Prince Harry’s girlfriends to the biggest role of her life: Prince Harry’s soon-to-be wife. In the wake of the engagement announcement, Markle has shown that she can swim with the media sharks by getting tossed into the deep end and handling her new royal role gracefully.  But there are rumors of one obstacle that Meghan and Harry never anticipated, and that is the alleged attitude of his stepmother, Camilla Parker Bowles. Fairy tales famously have an evil stepmother who mistreats her stepchildren, and for Markle and her Prince Charming, Camilla is rumored to be the real-life version of those tales.  Meghan Markle Praised For Rising To Role As Prince Harry’s Future Wife, But Is Camilla Parker Bowles Out To Stop Her?  Meghan has managed every challenge gracefully since the engagement. Markle has undergone hostage training and behaved perfectly during her initial appearances as Prince Harry’s now-official future wife during public outings. But Yahoo quoted sources as issuing a warning about Camilla Parker Bowles’ alleged power in obstructing Meghan’s smooth path to the altar with Prince Harry.  While rumors have swirled for months that Camilla disapproved of Prince Harry’s choice, it was never quite clear why Parker Bowles didn’t like Meghan. As the Inquisitr reported, there were even reports that Camilla was conducting a “smear campaign” against Markle that horrified Harry.  Camilla Parker Bowles’ Rumored Reasons For Disliking Meghan Markle Revealed  Now, however, these insiders are clarifying the reasons. Even though Meghan reportedly is seeking to embrace her new life as a future member of the royal family, Parker Bowles isn’t exactly making herself open to hugs and kisses, according to the sources. Instead, Camilla is reportedly in a state of fury about the way that Markle is being adored by the public while Parker Bowles is disliked.  In public, Parker Bowles has described herself as “absolutely delighted” about Prince Harry’s royal wedding. But behind the palace walls, insiders claim that Camilla is comparing the hostility that she faced in her 2005 wedding to Prince Charles to the warmth and welcome that Meghan is enjoying in planning her nuptials to Harry.  After fighting her way into the royal family, the Duchess of Cornwall sees how easy it is for Meghan Markle.  Camilla Parker Bowles clawed and fought her way to acceptance into the British royal family and can’t understand how easy it is for one woman to be so warmly welcomed. Granted, this woman isn’t having an affair with a married future king or is central to placing the monarchy in a scandal. Instead, she’s an American who has caught the eye of a younger royal. Times have changed and tolerance for the unconventional exists more now than it did when Camilla was having an affair with Charles while he was married to the late Princess Diana."

"Getty  Now, according to a report by In Touch, Brad has won a major victory in the wake of their bitter split.  After months of biding his time, Brad's waiting has finally paid off!  A source close to the actor told In Touch, 'Brad's finally got the kids, and he's overjoyed.  'To Brad's delight, Angelina has decided to let the majority of the children, who have summer camps and a slew of other activities in the works, stay in LA with their father while she's in Britain filming Maleficent 2.'  Brad was reportedly livid when Angelina told him she'd found a home in London to live in with all six children while she filmed the Disney sequel, 'but to keep him from fighting her on it,' a friend tells, 'she promised Brad that he could spend longer periods with their children.'  In Touch's report claims that's what their children want too.  RELATED:  The 54-year-old actor, 'couldn't be happier' according to In Touch, because now he knows he'll have his quality time with all six children.  In Touch's report further reveals Brad's already preparing his LA home.  'He gets such enjoyment out of seeing them cut loose at their amusement park-like former home,' the friend tells the publication. 'So, he's really spruced up the pool area, the skateboard ramp and the bike track.'  Spending time with his kids over the summer could give the actor the leverage he needs to get joint custody once and for all.  'He's been patient long enough,' says the friend. 'Something's got to give. Angelina can't control everything forever.'  Neither Brad or Angelina have responded to In Touch's report."
"Can music fans expect an amazing ""Starboy""/""Swish Swish"" mashup sometime soon? Katy Perry and The Weeknd recently had dinner together, according to multiple sources. But since the two singers are both currently single — with Perry's breakup from Orlando Bloom and The Weeknd recently splitting from Selena Gomez — could this dinner date be a sign of anything more than a friendship or a possible collaboration going on between the two?  Sources including Glamour UK and Vogue, reported that the two singers had a fashionable dinner date. According to The Sun's report, Perry and The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, dined together in West Hollywood and apparently had a great time with each other. They then reportedly went home separately. The Sun's report suggests that the date between the pair was romantic and not just a dinner between friends, but take that with a grain of salt. Not only are there are no details available from the singers themselves, but other publications are reporting that they simply got dinner, no romance involved.  While many sources have reported on this dinner between Perry and The Weeknd, most outlets have yet to report anything regarding a potential relationship between the pair. Sorry to burst the bubble of any Katy Perry and The Weeknd shippers, but it's probably just a rumor that the two are dating — at least right now.  Christopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  The Weeknd has found himself linked to a couple of different women after his breakup with Gomez, and it's not likely that he's actually dating every single person he'e seen with. On Nov. 11, Us Weekly reported that he was seen holding hands with Yovanna Ventura, who was previously linked to Justin Bieber, who is currently dating his ex-girlfriend (and The Weeknd's ex-girlfriend, for that matter) Gomez. According to an Us Weekly source, ""[The Weeknd] was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone. They were pretty affectionate and were together the whole night.""  There were also reports that The Weeknd was back in contact with his ex-girlfriend Bella Hadid. Although they reportedly haven't gotten back together romantically, People reported on Nov. 17 that ""He is talking to Bella a lot and they've hung out too."" The Weeknd and Hadid apparently ""still love each other"" and are seeing where things go with them, according to E!. It was also reported by Hollywood Life that he sent Hadid flowers before the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show ""with a sweet note"". The abundance of rumors surrounding The Weeknd's love life, show that romance rumors might be quick to catch-on whenever he's seen hanging out with anyone, as in the case with Perry.  Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Romance rumors surrounding the ""Starboy"" singer have been abundant ever since he and fellow singer Gomez were reported to have broken up. According to E!, the two singers dated for 10 months before they called it quits in late October. The split was reportedly amicable and it had nothing to do with Gomez hanging out with her ex. A source said, ""The relationship was basically over before Justin Bieber and Selena hung out."" It wasn't long after those two lovebirds' reunion hit the headlines. But, since it doesn't sound as though there wasn't any bad blood with that breakup, it's likely that The Weeknd is just focusing on doing his own thing.  Does his own thing involve Katy Perry? Probably not in a romantic way. Until the two singers confirm anything about a potential relationship, it's more likely that they are just two friends hanging out and possibly making some fans' pop dreams come true."
"Are Caitlyn Jenner & her rumored girlfriend planning on adopting a baby? According to a new report, a source close to the reality star says it’s a ‘real possibility’!  Will Caitlyn Jenner and her rumored girlfriend Sophia Hutchins start a family? A source claimed to Radar Online that a baby might be in the cards in the near future. “Jenner’s always wanted to be a mother, and now, that’s a real possibility,” Radar Online’s source revealed. “Sophia loves children and has been giving Cait little hints that she’s interested in a baby. Cait’s considering it.”  “[Sophia] has always wanted to be a mother and raise a little girl and have the opportunity to do fun, girly things like get her hair and nails done with her and take her shopping for her prom dress,” the source went on to say. “Cait’s made it clear to Sophia she doesn’t want the baby to have anything to do with television or reality TV. Fame has destroyed Cait’s relationship with her grown children and she’s not letting that happen again if she and Sophia adopt.” We reached out to Caitlyn’s rep who has denied Radar Online‘s report and called it a “complete fabrication”.  Recently, Caitlyn was shaded by her ex Linda Thompson for missing Brody Jenner‘s wedding. Along with posting a Nihi Sumba Resort, Linda wrote in the caption, “This is the beautiful location where @brodyjenner & @kaitlynn got married! Yes, it’s on the other side of the world… But I would’ve gone to the moon and back to share in the joy of my darling son & his beautiful bride getting married! That’s what parents do!” Be sure to check out all the recent pics of Caitlyn and Sophia in our gallery above!"
"It's officially time to start brainstorming couple names.  Last night, low-key lovers Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx both attended the glamorous Clive Davis Pre-Grammy Awards Gala, and they looked so enamored of each other the whole time. Are things getting serious between these two?  For the Pre-Grammy event, 39-year-old Holmes looked ravishing in a floor-length red gown and dark red lipstick. Foxx kept it sharp in a navy blue tux, and while the two arrived separately, they were seated together and looked incredibly cozy throughout the night, smiling from ear-to-ear all the while.  Image zoom Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for NARAS  According to People, Holmes tried to play it coy at the Gala, leaving the table before Clive Davis announced Foxx's presence. However, Davis pulled no punches, calling out the actress!  “This lady left the room right when I was going to introduce her, she was sitting at that table right with Jamie Foxx and everyone else,” Davis said, according to the source. “If you’re going to sit together what better night then tonight?”  Holmes and Foxx have been the subject of romance rumors for several years, but they've done a great job keeping their relationship out of the spotlight. However, they've been making more public appearances together lately, and we can't help but swoon over their relationship. They make an amazing couple!"

To celebrate her five years of service on the NBC morning program, Today expressed its love and appreciation for the 45-year-old co-anchor on Friday with a look back at some of her more memorable moments on the show — from the near 24-7 coverage she did on election night (while nearly nine-months pregnant) to some of her more silly moments, geeking out during celebrity interviews.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “To share it with all of you has been awesome,” a tearful Guthrie said after clip package aired. “I just feel completely overwhelmed with gratitude.”  “I’m kind of self-conscious and this show has brought that right out of me,” she added. “I walk into this building and I can’t believe this is me. And they call this work? It’s the joy of a lifetime.”  Co-anchor Matt Lauer praised Guthrie as the team toasted with milkshakes (Savannah’s favorite) and cake. “You make it look way too easy,” he gushed.

"Expanding Opportunity — #KempForum16Let’s get the conversation going on how we can fight poverty and expand opportunity in America. Join Senator Tim Scott and I as we moderate a forum on fighting poverty with Republican presidential candidates in Columbia, S.C., hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation. Follow along here and on Twitter with #KempForum16.I just wanted to say a few words about why we’re here today. And one reason why I’m here is that my mentor was Jack Kemp. There was no issue he was more passionate about than poverty.So I couldn’t think of a better host than the foundation that bears his name. Jack was the greatest champion of the American Idea, and he knew the fight against poverty is vital to renewing that idea in the 21st century.We’ve been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years now. And I don’t think you can call it anything but a stalemate. The federal government has spent trillions of dollars. And yet today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago.I’m not saying we haven’t made progress. We have. But today we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. What we need is a safety net that lifts people out of poverty — that helps them earn a good paycheck so they can support themselves. So, what is the problem?It is our strategy. Most of us think poverty is about deprivation — or not having enough money.We treat empty wallets like potholes. Fill them up and move on. So for the past 50 years, we’ve created over 80 different programs to fill over 80 different holes in people’s budgets: health care,child care, energy, education — with almost no coordination among them.Here’s the catch: You qualify for these programs based how much you make. So if you don’t make much, you get a lot of benefits. But as you work and make more, you start to lose benefits.And because we’ve piled these programs right on top of each other, the falloff is steep. Make a little more, and you’ll lose a ton. So we think we’ve been filling holes. But we’ve actually been building a trap. And that’s because poverty is about more than deprivation; it’s about isolation.There are many different kinds of poverty. But what a lot of them share in common is, people are cut off from the community. They don’t have the support they need to grow, whether it’s a counselor, or a teacher, or a boss.What they need is someone they can trust, someone who can help them learn new skills. And by discouraging work, the federal government is isolating the poor.That’s why we are here today. We as a country are not winning this war, and we conservatives have something to offer. I believe if we apply our principles to this challenge, we can come up with real solutions. Don’t just treat the symptoms of poverty. Get at the root causes of poverty.Don’t measure success based on inputs. Measure the results.And this, to me, is the biggest conservative insight: The answer is not the money in Washington.It is the people in our communities — the people with credibility. They’re the ones who can break through. And I’m not saying just cut money for the safety net. I’d say spend the same amount of money we do now — because this isn’t about saving money; it’s about saving lives.What I’m saying is, don’t minimize; customize. Take the money we’re spending now and direct it to homegrown solutions. Design aid to fit each person’s needs. And whatever you do,encourage work — because that’s how people reconnect with their community. Once they find their niche and put down roots, they draw strength from the people around them, and they grow.They’ll not only have enough money; they’ll be able to make enough money to get off assistance.The way I see it, the federal government is the rearguard; it should direct the supply lines. But the people in our communities — they’re the vanguard; they should fight poverty on the front lines.Now, I know a lot of people are wondering, “Why do you care about this? You’re Republicans.”I remind them, ‘Well, we’re Americans too.’ We all believe in the American Idea: The condition of your birth doesn’t determine the outcome of your life.If you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. If you made a mistake, you can redeem yourself.But a lot of people don’t think that’s true anymore. And we have to be honest with ourselves: If the American Idea is not true for everybody, then it is not true at all. So we all should care about poverty because it is a direct challenge to who we are.And it’s not enough to pay your taxes and think, “Government is going to take care of this.” We all have to get involved.And I know it’s easy to get discouraged. But what I’ve learned is, there are thousands of people beating poverty every day. The solutions are out there; they’re already working. We just have to support them. We just have to find them. And more often than not they’re right under our noses . . . in our communities . . . all over America.So I look forward to hearing from all our candidates and learning more about how we can build a more prosperous, a more secure, and a more confident America."

Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams — who play sisters on the beloved HBO drama — were seen arriving at the venue together on Saturday.  Turner, who is engaged to singer Joe Jonas, wore a red suit dress with a pair of over-the-knee length black boots to the ceremony, which she accessorized with a pair of red sunglasses and a black-and-white checkered purse.  Williams, 21, opted for a more low-key look and wore a black jumpsuit with a pair of red heels.

In October, though, the actor admitted to botching his proposal a bit during an appearance on the U.K.’s Jonathan Ross Show.  “I did have some plans to do it, I was going to string up some lights in some trees and do all the romantic stuff, but we were in the country and we were under this beautiful night sky and had a log fire burning and red wine and I blew my load early,” he said before laughing at the sexual insinuation. “Sorry, that’s a really bad expression!”  The actors first stirred up relationship rumors in 2012, in sync with their fictional GoT counterparts, Jon Snow and Ygritte.  Rose Leslie and Kit Harington  After a brief split, the couple reconciled and continued to fuel romance speculation until they officially confirmed the relationship in April 2016. They made their red carpet debut as a couple at the Olivier Awards in London.  They became close while on set in Iceland shooting for season 2. Harington previously opened up about the early days of their romance, admitting that those weeks were his favorite of the series.  “Because the country is beautiful, because the Northern Lights are magical, and because it was there that I fell in love,” he said in a cover story for L’Uomo Vogue. “If you’re already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love.”"

The actor, who stars on Lifetime’s critically acclaimed series UnREAL, told reporters at the Television Critics Association summer press tour that he had lost 70 lbs. between seasons — a weight loss meant to show the struggles his character Jeremy has been facing after helping orchestrate a car crash that appeared to kill a producer and undercover journalist in the season 2 finale.  “I lost 70 pounds after the second season,” Kelly said, per The Hollywood Reporter. “[Jeremy’s] dealing subconsciously but he’s not yet dealing with, consciously, the fact that he may or may not have killed people. You know when someone’s clean sober but clearly something’s up in their head? They’re like, ‘No, but look, I’m totally fine.

A cameraman on Everlasting — the Bachelor-like dating show run by Quinn (Constance Zimmer) and Rachel (Shiri Appleby) — he spent season one trying to move on from Rachel, only to reunite with her and hit her in a moment of rage in season 2.  Season three will present even more obstacles for Jeremy. “My first season went one way. Second season went a completely different direction,” Kelly said. “For the third season, I really got to change it up, and it was a lot of fun.”  RELATED VIDEO: UnREAL‘s Craig Bierko on His 50 Pound Weight Loss!

"New Girl‘s swan song at long last has a premiere date.  Fox on Thursday announced that the seventh and final season will begin airing on Tuesday, April 10 at 9:30/8:30c. The abbreviated eight-episode run will then air uninterrupted for six weeks, leading up to the one-hour series finale on Tuesday, May 15 at 9/8c. (FWIW, your math isn’t wrong. The network will inevitably air back-to-back episodes at some point before the finale.)  As previously reported, Season 7 kicks off with a four-year time jump. After returning from a European book tour (that Julius Pepperwood novel must have really taken off!), Nick and Jess begin contemplating marriage. Potentially complicating matters is Jess’ decision to take a job working for ex-boyfriend Russell (again played by Dermot Mulroney).  In addition, Cece and Schmidt are now parents to three-year-old daughter Ruth, with Schmidt having made the transition to stay-at-home dad. Last but not least are Winston and Aly (recurring guest star Nasim Pedrad), who are now married and expecting their first child. Winston will also be reunited with his estranged father (Curb Your Enthusiasm‘s J.B. Smoove).  New Girl‘s farewell run will feature no shortage of guest stars. In addition to those mentioned above, One Mississippi‘s Tig Notaro has been cast in an as-yet specified role. Returning faces include Damon Wayans Jr. (Coach), David Walton (Sam), Nelson Franklin (Robby), Sam Richardson (Dunston), and Jamie Lee Curtis and Rob Reiner (as Jess’ parents).

"Andrew Garfield has found himself in hot water with the LGBTQ community after saying, “I am a gay man right now, just without the physical act” — and revealing that he prepared for his new role as a gay man by watching RuPaul’s Drag Race with friends.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The 33-year-0ld actor is currently starring in the critically acclaimed London revival of Tony Kushner’s Angels in America, in which he plays Prior Walter — a gay man battling the reality of AIDS during the height of the 1980s crisis that killed hundreds of thousands in the gay community.  During a NT Platform discussion on Monday, the Amazing Spider-Man alum talked about how he prepared for the role — admitting at first that his “big concern” was “what right did I have to play this wonderful gay role” as a man who currently identifies as straight.  “As far as I know, I am not a gay man,” Garfield, who formerly had a high-profile relationship with Emma Stone, began, the Gay Times reported. “Maybe I’ll have an awakening later in my life, which I’m sure will be wonderful and I’ll get to explore that part of the garden, but right now I’m secluded to my area, which is wonderful as well. I adore it.”  “I had to trust that it was the right thing and Tony had asked me and maybe if he’d asked me, it was the right thing,” he added. “It was as about doing honor, doing justice and knowing my herstory.”  To prepare, Garfield spent time consulting his LGBTQ friends. “[The play is] as much devoted to my friends in the gay community as it is those that passed during the epidemic,” he said.  He also turned to an iconic drag queen: RuPaul. Garfield and friends made their way through every season of the Supermodel of the World’s hit series RuPaul’s Drag Race. “My only time off during rehearsals – every Sunday — I would have eight friends over and we would just watch Ru,” Garfield said.  “This is my life outside of this play,” he continued. “I am a gay man right now just without the physical act – that’s all.”  RELATED VIDEO: Andy Cohen’s Top 5 Most Revealing Plead the Fifth Answers  Garfield may have immersed himself in gay culture, but confusing that with the extent of gay life upset many members of the LGBTQ community — some of whom quickly expressed their frustration on Twitter, accusing Garfield of cultural appropriation.  “You’re a talented guy, but you seem to be completely oblivious to what is coming out of your mouth,” out actor Scott Evans (Daytime Divas) wrote.  “The straight white privilege of Andrew Garfield,” said out comedian H. Alan Scott. “Must be nice to be able to be gay without any of the hardships.”  Other users criticized Garfield for seemingly failing to understand that appreciating gay culture is not the same as experiencing the oppression facing the LGBTQ community now and throughout history.

Like, maybe just strike up a conversation? — ᴇʀɪᴋ (@erikjdavis) July 6, 2017  “Garfield compared watching a TV show and portraying a gay man to being gay without the physical act. No buddy,” said one user — with another adding Garfield had “a very limited view of what being gay ACTUALLY is.”  “Playing a gay man…doesn’t suddenly mean he understands oppression,” a critic wrote. “Why…is he preparing for a play about the TRAGEDY OF THE AIDS CRISIS by watching Drag Race? That’s obtuse at best.”  This isn’t the first time Garfield has found himself facing backlash from the gay community. During the Golden Globes in January, Garfield famously locked lips with Ryan Reynolds — causing many to criticize him for making a joke of a kiss between two men."

"Though he's been busy releasing new music for the past few weeks, Kanye West has been on his design hustle, too. Last night, the rapper-turned-designer debuted a new campaign for his Yeezy 500 Supermoon sneaker campaign on Twitter, and it turned heads to say the least.  The shots feature a diverse roster of models wearing West’s new footwear, along with other Yeezy pieces like sports bras, leggings, and sweatshirts. But a few models really wore nothing but the shoe. One of them included adult-film actress Lela Star (who has an uncanny resemblance to West's wife, Kim Kardashian).  The campaign was photographed by Eli Linnetz (who shot the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card). He shared another revealing angle from the shoot.  The Clermont twins also made an appearance, wearing only the Supermoon sneakers, socks, and biker shorts.  There was also this faceless model, who posed topless but sported grey shorts, Calabasas socks, and Yeezy kicks.  Not all models were nude. Some wore Yeezy's signature oversized sweaters and biker shorts (à la Kim Kardashian), others even sported jeans.  The roster also included younger-looking models, including a child.  This isn't the first time Kanye has launched a new campaign on social media. For his recent collections, Kim has worn his design in public and shared the paparazzi photos online to debut the clothes. He also enlisted other models including Paris Hilton, Amina Blue, and Sami Miro to pose as Kim lookalikes for the shots, resulting in a full-on social media swarm."

Mar 24, 2017  AceShowbiz - George Clooney is reportedly under FBI investigation for alleged money laundering. National Enquirer is the first to claim that the Oscar-winning actor ""has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with $1 MILLION in cash stuffed in a designer bag!""  The publication claims that there's a ""hush-hush government investigation"" surrounding the ""Money Monster"" actor and ""the hoity-toity dinner party that spawned it."" The alleged event was reported being held to celebrate the success of his tequila line, Casamigos.  The publication further contends Clooney, who is known for his ""generous nature,"" had a ""desire to spread the wealth."" It goes on citing a so-called source as saying, ""Being the practical joker he is, George would've known that doling out $1 million in cash to each guest would've caused some intrigue and embarrassment when they went to deposit the money at a bank.""

"The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”“Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,” she concluded."

"Amber Heard isn’t interested in giving her sexuality any kind of label.  When Allure Magazine asked the 31-year-old if she identified as bisexual, the actress responded, “I don’t identify as anything.”  “I’m a person,” explained Heard. “I like who I like. I happened to be dating a woman, and people started taking pictures of us walking to our car after dinner. I [was] holding her hand, and I realized that I have two options: I can let go of her hand and, when asked about it, I can say that my private life is my private life. Or I could not let go and own it.”  Heard, who previously married Johnny Depp, finalized her divorce from the actor earlier this year. But before her rocky marriage became highly publicized, Heard was dealing with a different kind of unwanted attention over her sexuality.  When she starred opposite Nicolas Cage in 2011’s “Drive Angry,” followed by “The Rum Diary” that same year with her ex, Heard claimed critics believed she was putting her career in jeopardy as the romantic lead.  “They pointed to no other working romantic lead, no other actress, that was out,” said Heard. “I didn’t come out. I was never in. It’s limiting, that LGBTQ thing. It served a function as an umbrella for marginalized people to whom rights were being denied, but it loses its efficacy because of the nuanced nature of humanity.  ""As we become more educated and expand the facts of our nature, we keep adding letters. It was a great shield, but now we’re stuck behind it. It’s so important to resist labels. I don’t care how many letters you add. At some point, it’s going to spell ‘WE ARE HUMAN.’”  These days, Heard is more interested in pushing for quality, especially within Hollywood.  “History tends to favor those on the right side of it,” said Heard. “Whether it’s civil rights in 1962 or suffrage in 1914 or gay rights in 2007. All of these debates seemed specific at the time, but if you pull back to the macro, there’s a trend: fairness. Justice is not as nuanced or delicate as it’s made out to be. And as the texture of our culture changes, [equality] will manifest differently in other debates.”"

"Harry Styles knows that you care way more than you should about his relationship with ex-girlfriend Taylor Swift, and he's ready to play with your feelings a little more.  Onstage at one of his concerts the other night, Styles mentioned Swift in such a sly way, that fans are already praying for a reunion. Wishing an audience member happy birthday, Styles asked how old she was turning, to which the fan replied, ""22."" It's not hard to guess what happened next.  Announcing the news to the audience, Styles said, ""22. She’s 22, okay? I don’t know about..."" And as every Swift fan knows, that's exactly how the lyrics to ""22"" go. You can watch the whole interaction on Twitter:    Unfortunately, Styles didn't launch into a full-on cover of ""22,"" although he should definitely consider doing so in a future set.

"Harvey Weinstein pled not guilty to sexually assaulting a woman in 2006 during an arraignment in downtown Manhattan on Monday.  It was a familiar scene for the 66-year old movie mogul. He had previously been arraigned in June on charges of first- and third-degree rape, and a first-degree criminal sexual act involving two other women. The charges stem from incidents that allegedly took place in 2004 and 2013.  A handcuffed Weinstein entered the court room on Monday wearing a dark suit, a white shirt, and a navy blue tie. He looked ashen and appeared to have shed some weight from his hulking frame. He was flanked by his attorney Benjamin Brafman, and whispered to him at various points during the arraignment.  Weinstein, the producer of hit indie films such as “Pulp Fiction” and “Shakespeare in Love,” was a force in Hollywood, renowned for his ability to pick art house fare that could cross over into the mainstream, and feared for his volatile temper. He also had deep ties to the Beltway, raising money for President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during their White House runs.  However, Weinstein’s career is in tatters. Dozens of women have come forward in recent months to accuse the producer of assaulting or harassing them. His accusers include prominent actresses such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and Ashley Judd. Weinstein’s fall helped lead to an industry-wide reckoning, one that led to charges of assault or misbehavior being leveled against other powerful figures such as Kevin Spacey, Dustin Hoffman, Matt Lauer, and Brett Ratner.  The new charges stem from accusations that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on a woman in July 2006. It carries a potential life sentence if convicted. He faces ​a minimum of 10 years in prison if found guilty. Law enforcement has not publicly identified any of the three women accusing Weinstein of assault, but one accuser, former marketing executive Lucia Evans, previously said she was pressing charges.  Weinstein faces a number of potential legal issues. Police in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and London are also investigating allegations that the producer assaulted or sexually abused women.  Weinstein is currently free on $1 million bail. Prosecutors spent most of the 20-minute hearing pushing to have the mogul placed under house arrest in New York City, a proposal that Weinstein’s attorney objected to, noting that he currently lives in Connecticut.  “He’s 66 years old with no criminal record,” said Brafman, arguing that if Weinstein moved to New York City, he would be hounded by media and would have to deal with a “circus atmosphere.” His Connecticut home has been sold, but Weinstein can remain there through February.  Manhattan Supreme Court Justice James Burke said that bail conditions will remain the same and Weinstein will not be under house arrest. In an impromptu press conference on the steps of the court house, Brafman said he had emails to defend Weinstein and added that “he is not a rapist or a predator.”  The attorney said that Weinstein was trying to clear his name so he could “hopefully go back to making movies.”  On Monday, the court room was nearly filled with media. Gloria Allred, an attorney who is representing one of Weinstein’s accusers, was also on hand. Brafman approached Allred shortly before the hearing and shook her hand.  “How are you?” he asked. “Glad you could make it.”  Allred later released a statement asking if Brafman was willing to put Weinstein on the witness stand.  “My client will testify under oath at the trial,” she said. “Are you ready to state unequivocally that Mr. Weinstein is ready to take the witness stand and testify as well?”"

"Portia de Rossi appeared on wife Ellen DeGeneres' talk show Wednesday to share the reason she said goodbye to acting.  ""I was approaching 45, aging out,"" de Rossi joked. ""I was just kind of wondering if there was something I could tackle now that I've never done before that would be really wonderful and different. I kind of knew what acting would look like for me for the next 10 or 20 years, so I decided to quit and start a business.""  In lieu of acting, de Rossi started General Public, an art curation and publishing company that uses special technology to print paintings.  ""I see a lot of women in their mid-forties kind of thinking about the next stage of their lives and I just didn't want to regret not trying something,"" de Rossi said.  The decision to quit wasn't one that initially stuck, though. After being written off Scandal, de Rossi still found herself filming season five of Arrested Development, which hits Netflix May 29.  ""I made this decision about 18 months ago, Shonda Rhimes wrote me off Scandal, it was fine,"" de Rossi recalled. ""I called Mitch Hurwitz, who's the creator of Arrested Development, and I said, 'If there is a season five I won't be doing it because I quit acting.' And he seemed really understanding and he totally got it, we had a really great conversation ... and then he wrote me into five episodes. I don't know how it happened, but yes, I am on season five.""  Apparently, Arrested Development appreciated de Rossi's appearance; the team there donated $50,000 to the Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund — the gift that de Rossi gave DeGeneres for her 60th birthday in January.  It turns out that gift, which de Rossi had to keep secret for five to six months, was hard to pull off.  ""It was so hard too because she's really observant. Not nosy, just observant,"" de Rossi assured. ""So yeah, it was really quite a feat to pull that off. I mean, you know, it's kind of hard to know what to get you, right?""  In between trying to successfully prepare DeGeneres' gift, de Rossi admittedly made a few mistakes with the guest list for her wife's birthday party.  ""I need to say this on the air. So it was up to me to do the guest list and I may have left a couple of very important people off the guest list. It's my fault. That's what I want to say,"" de Rossi said. ""Sorry, Jane Fonda. She's, like, my idol and I forgot her. Heidi Klum, you make the best swimsuits ever, thank you. I'm so sorry.""

Cheryl Burke will be returning for the 25th season of Dancing with the Stars — her 20th season competing on the reality dance competition series — the pro dancer confirmed Monday on Instagram.  Craig Sjodin/ABC via Getty  “Guess who’s back in the ballroom?! So excited to share that I’m officially back for my 20th season of Dancing With the Stars!” wrote Burke, 33.  “This dance floor will always be my home and I’ve got my eyes on that mirror ball ⭐️,” she continued, adding the hashtags “#bringonthespraytans #dwts.”  WATCH: Chloe Lukasiak On New ‘Dance Moms’ Coach Cheryl Burke: ‘She Was Incredible’  Burke is joining 12 fellow pros that were announced last week: Alan Bersten, Keo Motsepe, Artem Chigvintsev, Maks ChmerkovskiyVal Chmerkovskiy, Gleb Savchenko, Mark Ballas, Lindsay Arnold, Peta Murgatroyd, Emma Slater, Sharna Burgess and Witney Carson.  Burke, who has taken home two Mirrorball Trophies throughout her time on the ABC series (season 2 with Drew Lachey and season 3 with Emmitt Smith), last competed on season 23 with Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte.  PEOPLE’s special issue 25 Seasons of ‘Dancing with The Stars’ is out Sept. 15.  After it was confirmed in February that Burke would not be returning for the 24th season of DWTS, PEOPLE learned that she joined Dance Moms as dance after instructor Abby Lee Miller abruptly quit and announced her departure on social media, claiming she had been “manipulated and disrespected” by producers.  Since taking over the reins of the Lifetime series in March, Burke has taken a vastly different approach to teaching her Dance Moms students.  “I am approaching it differently. I don’t scream or yell — I don’t believe in that,” Burke previously told Steve Harvey. “But don’t get me wrong, I’m still — from people that have seen me on Dancing with the Stars — I am still strict, I’m stern and I expect the best out of my students. But I do it in a way that’s loving and it’s caring, and I try not to intimidate them or traumatize the kids.”  Season 25 of Dancing with the Stars premieres Sept. 18 on ABC."

"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)  Bobby Flay’s former wife Stephanie March has found love again — with hedge funder Daniel Benton, sources exclusively tell Page Six.  The “Law & Order: SVU” beauty, who finalized her contentious divorce from chef Flay last year, and Benton — the mogul behind high-flying tech fund Andor Capital Management — were spotted “looking very close” at a black-tie Whitney Museum gala on Tuesday where Leonard Lauder was honored.  A source further said that March and Benton have been together since October — “very quietly dating for six months,” said the source, adding the two are “crazy about each other.”  March was beaming in a pink gown with Benton by her side at the Whitney gala that was a sea of black frocks and tuxes. Among guests were artists Chuck Close, Ed Ruscha, Brice Marden and Frank Stella, gallerists Barbara Gladstone and Arne Glimcher, arts patrons Brooke Garber Neidich, Beth Rudin DeWoody and Anne Bass, museum director Adam Weinberg, and Ronald and Jo Carole Lauder.  Benton, who’s divorced from Axel Capital Management founder Anna Nikolayevsky, bought a 730 Park Ave. duplex in 2012 with his then-wife for $39 million. Harvard MBA whiz Benton launched Andor in 2001 after he was Wall Street’s fourth-highest earner in 2000 — making $100 million, behind Steve Cohen, who was No. 2 with $137 million, according to Forbes. Andor holds stakes in Tesla, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon.  In comparison, Flay’s reported net worth is a meager $20 million. He and March finalized their divorce last summer after their 10-year marriage ended, and they were reportedly battling over a prenup that would pay March just $5,000 per month.  March said in an interview last October, around the time she began dating Benton, “It’s been quite a year,” and she wanted to “[hug] everyone I love 1,000 times over . . . Life is short.” Friends, we hear, are very happy for the new couple. Reps didn’t comment."

"Jennifer Lawrence has nothing to hide.  While promoting her new movie, Red Sparrow, the 27-year-old actress sat down with Vanity Fair for a different kind of interview. Lawrence was hooked up to a lie detector test, where she was promptly quizzed on relationships, beauty, philosophy, pop culture and Vanity Fair's last category: the essentials.  So what did we learn about J.Law? First, she's not exactly calm under pressure. The polygraph itself was enough to get her heart racing, but she was pretty honest. She has no shame about her love for reality TV, she's open to dating a non-celebrity and she definitely regrets some of her red carpet looks.  The actress even volunteered information about herself, like the ""psychotic"" thoughts she has every time she's about to take the subway, why we should all believe in aliens, and her self-tanning habits.  Watch below:  Lawrence has no problem keeping it real. On Thursday's Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, she opened up about the rumors that she dated Brad Pitt, confessing that she didn't exactly mind seeing herself and the 54-year-old actor together in the tabloids.  ""I’ve met him once in like 2013, so it was very random,” Lawrence said with a laugh. “But, I also wasn’t, like, in a huge hurry to debunk it!”  See more in the video below.

"MediaTakeOut News is reporting (so, grain of salt) that Rihanna has ended things with her billionaire boyfriend of over one year, Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel, because she just ""gets tired of men sometimes."" Same.  ""Rihanna and him were together for a while,"" a source told the outlet. ""It was a good relationship, but now it's over. Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That's what she does: break[s] men's hearts."" There was nothing salacious or explosive about the ending either, the source claimed. ""Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes.""  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Finally, some gossip we know to be true in our hearts. Well, just the getting tired of men part. As for the veracity of the rest of the rumor, who knows?    Rihanna and Jameel have kept their relationship very private, and Rihanna has never posted anything about Jameel on her social media. In January, the two had a rare outing together and were photographed leaving a Grammys after party...apart but around the same time. They just didn't want to be photographed next to each other.  In Rihanna's June Vogue cover story, the interview of which was likely conducted weeks prior to its early May publication, the singer also said this of Jameel: “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time, but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before.”"
"Shonda Rhimes' Scandal will come to an end next year, according to a report from TVLine. The series, which is part of ABC's popular T.G.I.T Thursday night lineup, has been a hit for the network and has helped secure Rhimes' dominance and make a big name out of star Kerry Washington, who plays Washington D.C.'s ""fixer"" Olivia Pope.  This should not come as a huge surprise to big Shondaland fans, as Rhimes herself said that the show would have a shorter shelf life than her original hit, Grey's Anatomy, which is now in its 13th season. ""I feel like there is a finite amount of Scandal to be told,"" she told NPR in 2013. ""So I know what the end of Scandal will be, and I feel really good about that. And I can see where the end point is.""  Thus the show's conclusion was the decision of Rhimes, not the network. Among the advertiser-coveted 18 to 49 demographic, the show was among the 20 highest-rated shows of 2016. The current season averages 5.699 million viewers and 1.46 viewers in the 18-49 demo. While this marks a drop from the fifth season's average of 7.18 million viewers, the current live number is impressive considering the steady decline of live-viewership. Scandal remains one of ABC's most popular series and a large reason why the network routinely beats the other broadcasters on Thursday nights.  These ratings, of course, have allowed the network to pull in a hefty amount in ad revenue. At its peak, Scandal was part of a Thursday night block that brought ABC over half a billion dollars. In 2016, Scandal brought in $75 million for ABC--more than How to Get Away with Murder or The Catch, according to iSpot.tv.  ""What Shonda Rhimes possesses is this extraordinary instinct and compass for what our audience needs,"" then-president of ABC Entertainment group Paul Lee told FORBES in 2013. ""That Shonda is free and has a huge amount of power to pursue her vision is precisely how the magic happens.""  The network isn't the only beneficiary of Scandal's popularity. The show's stars have risen to prominence--and their wallets have grown--with the series. Washington routinely lands high on Forbes' list of highest-paid TV actresses. Last year, she pulled in $12 million, with about half of that coming from her salary from the show. Being on the show has made her well-known enough to land lucrative endorsement deals with the likes of Neutrogena and a commercial with Apple Music.  As a black lead on a broadcast series, Washington's star turn has also brought much-needed diversity to prime time. After the success of Scandal, Rhimes brought another African American woman--Viola Davis, the first black woman to ever win the Emmy for Best Lead Actress in a Drama--to the limelight on How to Get Away with Murder. On broadcast TV, only 22.6% of series regulars are of underrepresented racial minorities according to the 2016 Annenberg report on diversity. In dramas, like Scandal, this percentage drops. Unfortunately, that means two dramas with black leads is a big deal for the industry.  “There’s always room for our film and television, for our art, to be more representative of who we are as a culture. I think for me especially, being a person of color and a woman, you really see that intersection,"" she told WWD."

Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930."

"To read more scoop on this year’s season finales, pick up the new issue of Entertainment Weekly on stands Friday, or buy it here now. Don’t forget to subscribe for more exclusive interviews and photos, only in EW.  Wedding bells will soon be ringing at Grey Sloan!  EW can exclusively reveal that Jo (Camilla Luddington) and Alex (Justin Chambers) will be getting married in the season 14 finale of Grey’s Anatomy.  Slated to air Thursday, May 17, the finale is gearing up to be a big event — which, in the world of Shondaland, means things will certainly go awry.  “I am so excited for Jo and Alex to finally seal the deal and get married,” Luddington tells EW. “But in true Jolex form, the wedding will have lots of twists and turns to it.” See?  EW’s exclusive photo from the wedding definitely seems to speak to impending disaster.  Eric McCandless/ABC  It’s been a long road to the altar for these two. After his failed marriage to Izzie (Katherine Heigl) in the early years of Grey’s, Alex and Jo started dating in season 9. But the couple hit a major roadblock at the end of season 12 when Jo rebuffed Alex’s proposal, afraid to reveal her name wasn’t actually Jo Wilson — it was Brooke Stadler — and she was still married to an abusive man from whom she ran.  After Alex nearly landed in jail back in season 13 — long story involving him beating up DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti), whom he believed was hooking up with Jo — and Jo’s estranged ex Paul (Matthew Morrison) ended up dead in season 14, Jo ultimately proposed to Alex earlier this year.  The ABC medical drama will also close out the season with emotional farewells to longtime series regulars Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew. Geena Davis will be reprising her role as Dr. Nicole Herman, who returns to discuss an exciting opportunity with Arizona, seemingly signaling how Arizona will exit.  Details on Drew’s departure are being kept under wraps, but the logline for the penultimate episode, in which Davis also returns, does tease that one of Grey Sloan Memorial’s own will be seriously injured, prompting the team to reflect on what is truly important to them. Could their patient end up being Drew’s character April? We’ll find out when the penultimate hour airs on May 10.  Grey’s Anatomy airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC."

John Stamos (left) and Caitlin McHugh Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat  RELATED: All About John Stamos’ Disney-Themed Proposal  Until meeting McHugh, Stamos had long reigned as one of Hollywood’s most eligible bachelors. But the actor previously told PEOPLE that he long felt as though something was missing.  “I always wanted to be a dad,” the Fuller House star said of becoming a father for the first time. “I have a youthful thing. People say, ‘Oh, you look young.’ You start believing you’re gonna live to be 150.”  “And then you wake up and go, ‘No, man, this is it. This is not a rehearsal,’ ” he added. “People would say, ‘You should have a child.’ I was like, ‘That ship has sailed.’ ”  RELATED VIDEO: John Stamos Shares His Love Story with Caitlin McHugh  It helped that he and McHugh talked about having a baby in the past — and that everything eventually just fell into place.  “We have the same morals and the same values, that all clicked nicely. So we said, ‘Oh, well, maybe we should have a family,’ ” said Stamos, who proposed to the model and actress on Oct. 22 at Disneyland (one of her favorite places) after two years of dating.  “The look on John’s face when I told him we were pregnant was priceless,” McHugh added. “It was the look of a man who has wanted a family of his own but wasn’t sure it was going to happen for him. Now it is!”"

"Wolf writes that Jolie is a feminist superhero who actually has it all. And not in the Carrie Bradshaw sense (you know—sex, shoes, fashion, NYC, girls' night out!, cosmos); rather, admired for her sexuality as much as for being a good person and mom.  Examples please, Ms. Wolf:  1. It all started with her early roles like Girl, Interrupted and Tomb Raider, which established her as ""sexy and daring, confrontational and independent."" That set the stage for everything else.  2. Then she adopted Maddox. ""Suddenly, she seemed more mature, more beautiful, and more serious"" and made single motherhood look awesome. ""She was reframing single motherhood from a state of lack or insufficiency to a glamorous, unfettered lifestyle choice,"" Wolf suggests.  3. She learned to fly a plane, which is the ""ultimate in single-mom chic."" Also, Wolf points out that flying a plane is typically a man thing, so Angie is metaphorically making her own decisions without the help of men. Girl power!  4. Then she chose the most perfect man who ever existed and didn't care about whether he was married. Yes, this makes her a homewrecker. But Wolf argues that Brad Pitt looked so good with the kids as the ultimate male role model that Angie was able to get away with it unscarred.  5. Taking Brad as her lover was also Angie's big ef you to society and rules (like don't steal people's spouses). Break it down, Wolf-style: ""Jolie's evident disdain of that social constraint certainly, for better or worse, put her in the same self-entitled category as those men who have traditionally taken what they wanted and let the emotional chips fall where they may.""  6. And finally, by visiting Afghan refugees in Pakistan and penning op-eds about Darfur in Time, Angelina makes other female stars look lazy with their silly tanning and partying.  And so, Angie is the ""ego ideal"" for ladies. They can live out the fantasy of achieving ultimate single-mom chic, taking the sexiest married man alive as their lover (consequence free), building a small multi-ethnic baby army and solving the world's injustices—while still being desired sexually throughout it all.  Case closed on the Mystery of the Great Straight Lady Desire for Angelina Jolie."

"Bill O’Reilly was reportedly minding his own business at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was approached by two women and three men who said they were “disgusted” by his behavior towards women at Fox News. O’Reilly, who has never been afraid of anyone, turned and told the group to grow up and leave him alone. That’s when the “tolerant” liberals got violent.One of the men grabbed O’Reilly and dragged him out into the street, according to witnesses, where the other two men proceeded to kick him until he was unconscious and bleeding. The 5 perpetrators, who are still at large, ran off like the cowards they are. The police arrived within minutes and called for medical help.O’Reilly was taken to St. Vincent’s where he is in critical condition with 4 broken ribs and a punctured lung. Doctors also fear that he had a cardiac event and have him on a monitor. They are hopeful, but with O’Reilly’s age and the extent of his injuries, he may not make it through.The family is asking for privacy at this difficult time and police are asking for anyone with cell phone pictures or videos of the incident to contact them. So far nobody has come forward other than more New York liberals who say O’Reilly “got what he deserved” for allegedly harassing women in the workplace.Liberals are always talking about cruel and unusual punishment. They don’t want murderers to be executed or terrorists to be “tortured,” but it’s perfectly acceptable for a man to be beaten within an inch of his life for something nobody has proven he’s done.Liberalism is truly a mental disorder."

"Roger Ailes, Former Fox News CEO, Dies At 77  Enlarge this image toggle caption Wesley Mann/Fox News via Getty Images Wesley Mann/Fox News via Getty Images  Former Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes has died, the network says, citing a statement from the late executive's family. Ailes resigned from his post leading Fox News last July, amid allegations of sexual harassment. He was 77.  Ailes helped found Fox News in 1996. On Thursday, the network initially announced his death by citing the Drudge Report, which had published a statement from Ailes' wife, Elizabeth.  According to Fox News, that statement reads:  ""I am profoundly sad and heartbroken to report that my husband, Roger Ailes, passed away this morning. Roger was a loving husband to me, to his son Zachary, and a loyal friend to many. He was also a patriot, profoundly grateful to live in a country that gave him so much opportunity to work hard, to rise — and to give back.""  Remembrances Roger Ailes, Founder Of 'Fox News,' Dies At 77 Roger Ailes, Founder Of 'Fox News,' Dies At 77 Listen · 4:36 4:36  Anchors of the channel's morning show Fox & Friends were noticeably emotional in announcing Ailes' death.  ""Beth, you are in our thoughts and prayers,"" co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, ""and so is Zachary, their beautiful son. Roger, rest in peace.""  Ailes was famous for his shrewd leadership of Fox, including his focus on airing conservative opinions and hiring anchors and reporters with big personalities. But he left Fox with a tarnished legacy, facing legal actions over allegations of sexual harassment.  Ailes denied accusations that he built a culture at Fox that encouraged harassment, after a lawsuit by former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson prompted other women at the network, including high-profile anchor Megyn Kelly, to step forward with similar claims. He abruptly resigned last July.  In the decades before he created a ratings juggernaut in Fox News, Ailes worked in politics, serving as a media adviser and consultant — most famously for Richard Nixon, whom Ailes helped to win the presidency in 1968. He later worked for other Republican leaders, from Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush to New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  Ailes was a producer of the variety and talk program The Mike Douglas Show when he met Nixon. In the years that followed, as NPR's David Folkenflik has reported, Ailes ""kept toggling between producing television specials and serving as a political consultant, sometimes doing both at once.""  The architect of Fox News was also close to President Trump, to whom he gave a weekly slot on Fox & Friends — a show that the president has regularly touted in his tweets from the White House.  Trump ""sort of represents Roger Ailes' legacy of 50 years of using television to advance a style — a populist style of conservative politics,"" journalist and author Gabriel Sherman told NPR's Terry Gross last summer.  Sherman, who wrote a biography of Ailes titled The Loudest Voice In The Room, also spoke to Terry back in 2014, when his book was first published.  Discussing Ailes' impact on politics and culture in the U.S., Sherman said, ""One of Ailes' lasting legacies will be that for millions of Americans, news is now no longer viewed as a way to be informed about the world; it's a way of gathering information that advances your side."""

Most of the ones giving advice are in no place to give anything at all.”  “Focus on your own world. I’m sure there’s cracks there that need your attention. We all got em,” she added."
"We have learned that Kourtney Kardashian is not at all impressed by the fact that it looks like her ex Scott Disick’s current girlfriend Sofia Richie is morphing into her! As fans of KUWK may already know, it has become apparent for a while that the 19-year-old is stealing her style and Kourt is convinced it is all Scott’s doing!  One insider explained that ‘Kourtney’s definitely more than a little creeped out by how Sofia appears to be stealing her look. But, it also makes her sad because she realized how young and impressionable Sofia is.’  The source went on to say that the mother of three suspects Scott is to blame for Sofia’s drastic physical change ever since she started dating him.  ‘Kourtney thinks she is probably being controlled, or at the very least, manipulated, by Scott. Some people might find it flattering, but she just thinks it’s gross, and Scott needs to grow up, move on, and start living as an independent adult for once.’  As you may remember, at the beginning of Scott and Sofia’s relationship, the teen was rocking her blonde hair and was wearing pretty colorful clothes.  Now, however, not only did she dye her hair brunette but her wardrobe consists of mainly dark blazers and crop tops as well as very thin sunglasses.  Fans of KUWK know that all of these style elements are staples of Kourtney’s fashion.  @milesrichie ? ? @alansilfen A post shared by Sofia Richie (@sofiarichie) on Mar 7, 2018 at 7:39pm PST  We have previously learned that Kourtney did try to discuss with Scott the fact that Sofia keeps on copying her look, but he laughed it off.  Advertisement  ‘[Kourtney] makes comments about it to Scott, and he laughs it off and tries to flip it on her. He just calls her a narcissist and acts like she is crazy for mentioning it, which is so frustrating for her. But, also so typical of Scott. As far as Kourtney’s concerned, this bizarre situation is more proof Scott and his girlfriend are obsessed with her.’"
"Roy Halladay, a two-time Cy Young Award winner admired as much for his off-the-field persona as his Hall of Fame pitching ability, died Tuesday when the private plane he was piloting crashed off the Florida coast in the Gulf of Mexico.  A fearsome competitor on the mound, Halladay, 40, earned universal appreciation within the sport, from teammates and opponents alike. He was one of 23 pitchers to throw a perfect game, and joined the Yankees’ Don Larsen as the only two to fire a no-hitter in the postseason.  Halladay did it for the Phillies in his playoff debut, on Oct. 6, 2010, and came within a fifth-inning walk to the Reds’ Jay Bruce of also being perfect that remarkable evening at Citizens Bank Park. The baseball world was in shock Tuesday after learning of Halladay’s fatal accident, which came only four years after his retirement from the Phillies, his 16-year career prematurely ended by his decision to avoid back surgery.  “We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladay’s untimely death,” the Phillies said in a statement. “There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.”  Halladay recently purchased the A5 ICON, a two-seat, single-engine amphibious plane capable of landing on water, and his Twitter feed was filled with photographs of him flying the aircraft. According to the Pasco County (Fla.) Police Department, the plane went down in the water, about a quarter-mile offshore, and Halladay died in the crash. There was no one else traveling with him.  Halladay’s accident is the latest in a number of plane crashes that have claimed the lives of prominent baseball players. The Pirates’ Roberto Clemente perished while on a relief mission to Nicaragua on New Year’s Eve in 1972, the Yankees’ Thurman Munson crashed while piloting his own plane near his Ohio home, and another Yankee, Cory Lidle, died when his plane collided with a Manhattan apartment building in 2006.  “Our hearts are broken,” said Tony Clark, the union’s executive director and a former player. “Roy Halladay was not just one of the greatest competitors, but was also among the best men in our generation of players.  Subscribe to Sports Now newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.  “Our paths crossed many times during our careers, and I can tell you he was among the toughest pitchers I ever faced. But while he never gave in on the mound, he was known in both leagues as an outstanding teammate, a guy who would go out of his way to help other players.”  Halladay, nicknamed “Doc,” was a throwback. As baseball gradually moved to de-emphasize the starting pitcher, he still took pride in going the distance, with 67 complete games, including 20 shutouts. An eight-time All-Star, Halladay also was a three-time 20-game winner, twice during his 12-year stint in Toronto. Halladay will be eligible for the Hall of Fame in 2019.  “The Blue Jays organization is overcome by grief with the tragic loss of one of the franchise’s greatest and most respected players, but even better human being,” the team said in a statement. “It is impossible to express what he has meant to this franchise, the city and its fans.”  In addition to his impact on baseball, Halladay left a lasting imprint on his Florida community, with the Pasco County Police struggling both to investigate the crash and mourn a friend.  “He was one in a million,” Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco told The Associated Press. “It is a true loss for us.”  Nick Fanti, the former Hauppauge High School pitching standout, fondly remembered Halladay after having him as an instructor at the Phillies’ camp in spring training.  “I was fortunate enough to work with Roy Halladay and can honestly say I’m not only a better baseball player, but a better person off the field for it,” Fanti tweeted. “To be able to listen to him talk about his process and how he played the game was an honor. Truly a professional and a legend and will be missed.”  Halladay is survived by his wife, Brandy, and two sons, Ryan and Braden.  Former and current players flocked to Twitter to express their condolences, with Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy summing up a generation’s feelings.  “Roy Halladay was your favorite player’s favorite player,” McCarthy tweeted. “A true ace and a wonderful person.

"Kim said she decided to use a surrogate after experiencing ""bad deliveries"" and having a few surgeries on her uterus.  ""I really didn't have a choice,"" she said. ""I, at this point, couldn't get pregnant and we wanted to expand our family. So the fact that that is something that you can do, and it's really taboo to talk about and people don't really understand it, I mean, even throwing my baby shower, do I a baby shower? What do I do? I thought I wanted to because I wanted North to experience a party, like, 'Something's coming, someone's coming. We're going to welcome our little sister coming.' So I think that...that really like got everyone in the mood.""  ""But there are no rules. It's like, you know, I saw online people were saying today, like, 'Did you invite your surrogate to the shower? Is she invited?'"" Kim continued. ""What are the rules? There are no rules and I'm trying to figure it out. But I thought I'd want to be open about my experience because it's what I'm going through.""  Kim said she decided she wanted a baby shower days before it was held.  ""I was in the mindset of, 'I'm not going to do a baby shower,'"" Kim said on The Real. ""And all of a sudden, like five days before the baby shower, I was like, 'I have to do it.' Cherry blossoms, it's what I wanted. We had to rent off these cherry blossoms. They pulled it off in four or five days...and it was so beautiful and it was just a tea for my friends and it was beautiful. I'm so glad that I did it.""  The baby shower featured pink cherry blossom trees, which fueled speculation Kim and Kanye are expecting a girl. Kim then confirmed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show this week that they will be welcoming their second daughter.  Kim and Kanye's new baby will join big sister North West, 4, and big brother Saint West, who will turn 2 in December.  ""It is an interesting transition. She is so excited it's a girl,"" Kim said about North. ""She is so excited. I think my son's gonna have a harder time with it, I don't know why. I hope he doesn't. I tell her every night, 'You know, when you're coming in my room and it's now two in the morning, you know I might be in Baby Sister's room feeding her, so you can't, you know, I'm not always gonna be here.' And she's like, 'I know, Mom.' Let's see. Let's see."""

"If you've seen the classic Groundhogs Day with Bill Murray , maybe you wondered how many Groundhog Days occur in the movie? Science has an answer.  By science, we mean the internet. According to IFC , here's the exact numbers:  Groundhog Days Murray’s Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. That’s 33 years and 358 days""  Over 33 years of the same day. By that, you would know EVERY single person in town, which Phil Connors seems too. They came to this by adding up every day we see Phil endure, plus any day he specifically mentions but we don’t see:  (he claims he’s been “stabbed, shot, poisoned, frozen, hung, electrocuted, and burned,” but we only see the electrocution, so tack on six more days  Also, did you know Billy Murray was bitten twice by the groundhog on the set?

"Jennifer Lawrence’s nude scene in her new spy film is all about reclaiming her agency.  In “Red Sparrow, ” which hits theaters on Friday, Lawrence plays a Russian ballerina-turned-assassin who uses her sexuality for espionage. The film requires her to go nude ― a first for the actress, and something she said “scared the hell out of me.”  “I tried to do the movie without nudity but realized it just wouldn’t be right to put the character through something that I, myself, am not willing to go through,” Lawrence told Vanity Fair for the March edition cover story.  But her decision was that much more difficult in light of a photo hack back in August 2014 that targeted her and other celebrities like Kate Upton, and leaked intimate photos of them on the internet.  Vanity Fair Jennifer Lawrence covers Vanity Fair's March 2018 issue.  “My biggest fear was that people would say, ‘Oh, how can you complain about the hack if you’re going to get nude anyway?’” Lawrence said.  The photo hacker has since been sentenced to 18 months in prison for using fraudulent email addresses to gain access to various iCloud and Gmail accounts.  Lawrence previously described the photo-hack experience as being “gang-banged by the f**king planet.” But going nude in “Red Sparrow,” she said, was about feeling empowered on her own terms.  “One is my choice,” she explained to Vanity Fair. “I got something back that was taken from me, and it also felt normal.”  Karwai Tang via Getty Images Jennifer Lawrence attends the European Premiere of ""Red Sparrow.""  The spy film reunited Lawrence with “Hunger Games” director Francis Lawrence, who she said helped her adjust to some potentially uncomfortable moments on set.  “He looked me right in the eyes like I had clothes on and then all of a sudden I was like, ‘Oh, O.K., it’s just like I have clothes on,’” she told the magazine. “Everybody here is professional. You’re still at work. One look just made me comfortable. It didn’t make me feel naked.”  Still, Lawrence admitted there was something icky about baring it all in front of a crew she’s worked with since the first installment in the dystopian “Hunger Games” trilogy.  “They all knew me since I was a baby,” Lawrence said, adding that she teased crew members after filming wrapped, telling them, “I hope you guys feel creepy.”  Dave J Hogan via Getty Images Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Lawrence attend a ""Red Sparrow"" photocall.  The role also required her to get in ballerina-ready physical condition and undergo months of serious training to make the dancing scenes look believable.  “I’ve always wondered what it would take to get me to really diet, to really be hungry, because I’ve never done it for a movie,” Lawrence said. “For ‘Hunger Games,’ they told me to lose weight, and then I discovered Jack in the Box. ‘Red Sparrow’ was the first time that I was really hungry, and disciplined. I can’t be in character as an ex-ballerina and not feel like an ex-ballerina.”  Lawrence previously opened up about being told to stand in a nude photo lineup for an audition early in her career to shame her into losing weight. But her days of dieting without relief and subscribing to Hollywood’s toxic beauty standards are over.  “I can’t work on a diet. I’m hungry. I’m standing on my feet. I need more energy,” she said. “I remember having a meltdown, freaking out that I had eaten five banana chips.”"

Kylie Jenner has given birth to her first child with boyfriend Travis Scott [Instagram/ Kylie Jenner]  Keeping Up With The Kardashians star Kylie Jenner, 20, and her boyfriend Travis Scott have finally confirmed her pregnancy after she gives birth to a baby girl.  After months of speculation, Kim Kardashian West's youngest sister has released a 10 minute video detailing the pregnancy and the safe arrival of her healthy daughter.  The news comes following months of speculation and a Calvin Klein campaign by all the Kardashian sisters that had Kylie fans convinced once and for all she was expecting a child.  Kylie Jenner shares small glimpse of her baby [Kylie Jenner/YouTube]  The star shows off her bump in a video uploaded to her social media page [Kylie Jenner/YouTube]  Following the announcement that Khloe Kardashian is pregnant with her first baby with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, fans have been calling on the 20 year old to confirm the news, with some furious that she didn't confirm it in a recent KUWTK, when Khloe told her she was pregnant.  Here's everything you need to know about Kylie Jenner's rumoured pregnancy:  The star uploaded a video of her pregnancy journey to her social media pages [Kylie Jenner]  Travis Scott and Kylie Jenner have also been having relationship problems according to reports [Twitter / RodeoTheAlbum]  Kylie and Travis split?  It was reported Kylie and Travis split in the last few months of her pregnancy but the baby clip - put together by close friends - tells a different story.  Showing Kylie and Travis completely loved up, and in the delivery room as she gave birth only days ago, the duo couldn't be happier.  Kylie Jenner's 'baby bump'  With her absence from social media, fans were on the look out for a baby bump and have even found an old social media video from the Golden Globes where they're convinced they can spot a baby bump.  Photos taken ""months ago"" from her friend's birthday party, also show Kylie in an oversized jumper, concealing her figure.

Khloe Kardashian's sister has also undergone a makeover and chopped her hair [Kylie Jenner/Instagram]  Is this the moment Travis Scott found out?  Fans are convinced they know when Travis Scott found out the 'happy news' from Kylie, who has a huge net worth.  On June 12, the star cryptically tweeted: ""Legit the happiest day of my life.""  According to Perez Hilton this would coincide perfectly with the reported due date, and the pair went on to get a matching butterfly tattoo.  Travis Scott tweeted a cryptic message back in June [Twitter]  Due date  People magazine originally reported Kylie was due to give birth in February 2018.  A source said: “They started telling friends a few weeks ago. The family has known for quite some time.

A source told them: ""Kylie prefers to stay home. She feels good, but her body is changing. She doesn’t want to be photographed.  ""At the moment, she wants more privacy. She has family and friends come to her house instead so she has company."""
"I’ve been saying for a solid year that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux’s marriage seemed very strange. They barely seemed to spend any time together, and it wasn’t like their time apart was just about competing work schedules at all. Things got even stranger in the past week, with Jennifer celebrating her 49th birthday in Malibu, all while Justin was in New York, hanging out with his dog and not doing anything particularly important. I told you guys I was getting a weird feeling about JustJen. And look, I was right. Justin and Jennifer are over.  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have split after two and a half years of marriage — and seven years as a couple, the Associated Press reports. The two spent quite a bit of time apart in recent months, with Theroux often spotted in New York City away from their L.A. home. They have also a busy year as Aniston signed on with Reese Witherspoon for a new Apple TV series and filmed Dumplin’ in Atlanta, while Theroux, 46, filmed the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me in Budapest. The decision comes just days after the actress’s 49th birthday, which she and Theroux spent apart. Aniston celebrated in Malibu, California with a gathering alongside pals Courteney Cox, Andrea Bendewald, Leigh Kilton-Smith and Kristin Hahn on Sunday. Theroux, meanwhile, was spotted out in New York City on Friday walking his dog. Last year, the duo vacationed together in Los Cabos, Mexico with friends.  [From People]  I mean… again, I’ve been thinking for a while that they were barely even together at this point. He was always in New York or traveling for work. She stayed in LA. Was it all that time apart that ultimately destroyed their marriage? Honestly – and I’m not saying this just to be mean – I never believed they had the most solid foundation in the first place. They got together when he was living with his then-longterm girlfriend Heidi Bivens. He hated the idea of moving to LA, and she pretended to move to New York for a short time to make him happy, but she gave that up. It took forever for them to go through with the wedding, and it was reported in People Magazine that HE was the holdout, that he was always wary of becoming Mr. Jennifer Aniston. I don’t know. It just felt like there was always too much going against them. Anyway, I’m sure we’ll be hearing a lot more in the days, weeks and months to come. So long, bizarre quartz engagement ring!  Update: Here’s the Associated Press’s piece, which includes the statement they made together:  The couple says in a statement released through her publicist Thursday that the decision to split “was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year.” The couple says they are making the announcement publicly “in an effort to reduce any further speculation.” “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,” says the statement released by longtime Aniston publicist Stephen Huvane. “Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.” Aniston and Theroux say they are “two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.”  In case anyone was wondering if the “Poor Jen” narrative was going to be revived, there’s your answer. Poor Jen, still being hounded by gossip!"

"Selena Gomez has had a rough year with reports she's battling lupus, a stint in rehab, and her altogether exhausting on-again off-again relationship with Justin Bieber.  All that aside, the 21-year-old's rep says that In Touch Weekly's report claiming the former Disney star was pregnant in 2012 -- but miscarried -- while she was dating Bieber is completely false. In Touch alleges that Gomez wanted to have the child and subsequently went into a ""downward spiral,"" which later led to said stint in rehab in 2014.  The rumor also had one of the tabloid's sources claiming Bieber's team felt the baby would ""ruin his career because at the time he had a clean image."" And while the thought of Bieber with a ""clean image"" these days is worth a few chuckles, Gomez's rep told Us Weekly that the entire pregnancy report is ""100 percent fictional.""  As for her recent stay in rehab, which she left after just 14 days into a six-week program, much to the objections of facility staff, Gomez's rep also confirmed that it wasn't because of a miscarriage.  In the months since Gomez left rehab, there has been plenty of shakeup in her life, including rumored tiffs with friends. Without warning, she also fired her mother and stepfather as managers in April. A few days later, Gomez left CAA for WME, signing with Brillstein Entertainment Partners for management -- a ""crucial piece of the Disney alum's strategy, long in the works, to move on to more adult-oriented fare in film and music,"" according to The Hollywood Reporter."

"Caitlyn Jenner is the queen of shocking fans and her latest announcement will certainly blow your mind. A new report claims that the reality star is planning on adopting a baby boy!  Caitlyn Jenner, 66, is no doubt loving her new life, but something seems to be missing. The transgender reality star is reportedly expanding her family and is adopting a baby boy. That’s not all. She plans to bring the little one home with the help of another woman!  “She is going to adopt and is leaning toward a little boy,” a source told In Touch. That’s not all. Caitlyn is looking to raise a little one with her bestie Candis Cayne, 44. “Caitlyn and Candis have thought about adopting an older child because there are a lot of trans kids whose parents have turned away, or who have run away from home. But the ideal scenario is a baby. Being a mom is Caitlyn’s dream.” Unfortunately, not everyone in her family is on board with this idea — especially Kris Jenner said the insider. “Caitlyn all of a sudden thinking she can be a mom is beyond belief. Everyone is scratching their heads over this one. Kris says Caitlyn adopting a baby is not only ridiculous but a shameful grab for attention — and Kris knows about getting attention.” To hear more about Caitlyn Jenner, head over to iTunes and download the latest HollywoodLife podcast for free!      The source also revealed that “Kris is 60 and the last night she would ever want to do again is raise a child. Kris wonders how Caitlyn is going to raise a child now when she barely raised her own kids when she was Bruce — because Bruce wasn’t a hands-on dad unless it involved fun sports stuff.” Well, regardless, we hope Cait continues to help young kids who are struggling with their own transitions. Since coming out as transgender in 2015, Caitlyn has been deemed an important figure in the fight against LGBTQIA rights.  HollywoodLifers — do you think Caitlyn is going to adopt a baby?

"Her 'Today' co-anchor Al Roker attacked the ""culture of Twitter and waiting to pounce"" on people over mistakes and called out the New York Times for its participation. ""It's a cheap shot.""  Jenna Bush Hager issued an apology over her Golden Globes snafu on Monday morning's Today.  The NBC News correspondent was covering her first red carpet for the network Sunday when she found herself thrust into the viral news spotlight after interviewing Hidden Figures nominee Pharrell.  ""So you're nominated for Hidden Fences,"" said Bush Hager, mistakenly combining the title of his film, Hidden Figures, with the also nominated Fences, starring Viola Davis and Denzel Washington. The New York Times' Dave Itzkoff highlighted the moment with a video on Twitter, sparking social media to quickly comment on Pharrell's taken-aback expression.  ""I had an error in the night, which I have to apologize for,"" said Bush Hager, who was joined by Al Roker and Natalie Morales on the NBC morning show. ""When I was interviewing the incomparable Pharrell, who I adore, I accidentally — in the electricity of the red carpet, which I've never done one before — called Hidden Figures 'Hidden Fences.' I have seen both movies, thought they were both brilliant. I've interviewed casts for both of the movies, and if I offended people I am deeply sorry.""  Later in the night, Michael Keaton made the same notable error when presenting the best supporting actress award, sparking the term #HiddenFences to trend on Twitter. While some users posted jokes and memes, others such as Gabrielle Union and Justin Simien noted their disappointment about the confusion and comedian-actress Robin Thede said, ""All movies with black people don't sound alike.""  ""It was a mistake, because ya'll know I'm not perfect,"" continued Bush Hager, who at this point began to choke up and get teary-eyed. ""I am authentic, but a human. And what I didn't want to do is make anyone lesser than who they are. I apologize to both the cast, to Pharrell, but it was a mistake and I hope we can move on.""  Both Roker and Morales swooped in to defend Bush Hager, with Roker blasting the ""culture of Twitter and waiting to pounce on people"" for what he said is a common mistake for live TV broadcasters.  ""We've all been in live situations and you make a mistake,"" said Roker, adding how he forgot Braveheart when he was interviewing Mel Gibson and referred to Jessica Biel as Jessica Alba during his Sunday interviews. ""Honest mistakes happen in live television and this culture of Twitter and waiting to pounce and get on people, it's got to stop. It's got to stop somewhere, because it's pretty ridiculous.""  He then chided The New York Times.  ""For The New York Times to pile on and repeat these tweets, it's a cheap shot,"" said Roker.  Bush Hager conceded that she has thick skin, but ""to act as though I don't care about people really hurt,"" prompting Morales to point out the red-carpet chaos.  ""It's like a mosh pit,"" she said. ""You're getting celebrities coming at you from all directions. It's a lot happening at the same time, and I think you had just interviewed the cast of Fences also, I think you were just right there in the moment, so it happens.""  But Bush Hager wouldn't cop to the excuse and ended with more of her apology.  ""I know how brilliant those films are and I did not want to make anyone feel lesser,"" she said.  Shortly after the segment aired, Hidden Figures star Octavia Spencer took to Twitter to say she accepted Bush Hager's apology. ""We all make mistakes, hon! Thanks for your apology!"" she tweeted.  Hidden Figures co-star Janelle Monae and director Theodore Melfi ‏also accepted Bush Hager's apology on Twitter.  Dearest, @octaviaspencer Your kindness means so much to me + your compassion is matched only by your incredible talent in Hidden FIGURES! X https://t.co/LkLNbREjtq — Jenna Bush Hager (@JennaBushHager) January 9, 2017  Thank u @JennaBushHager! Your ownership, public acknowledgement, & genuine apology makes me you more!

""We all get to the peak together or we don't get there at all."" Blessings, Ted — Theodore Melfi (@theodoremelfi) January 9, 2017  Later, Pharrell himself took to Twitter to tell Bush Hager that ""everyone makes mistakes."" He also joked that ""Hidden Fences does sound like an intriguing movie.""  Don't worry @JennaBushHager!Everyone makes mistakes. Hidden Fences does sound like an intriguing movie though. Just saying... — Pharrell Williams (@Pharrell) January 9, 2017  Also on Monday, Hidden Figures beat out the reigning Rogue One: A Star Wars Story at the weekend box office, coming in at No. 1 with $22.8 million. Co-star Taraji P. Henson said the box-office success came in spite of people telling her, ""Black women can't open films domestically or internationally."" She added, ""Well, anything is possible.""

"Newly-engaged Karlie Kloss couldn’t wait to share her happy news with those closest to her — including her good friend, Princess Beatrice.  On her Instagram story Wednesday morning, the supermodel, who confirmed her engagement to longtime boyfriend Joshua Kushner on Tuesday, posted a series of her famous friends’ reactions on FaceTime.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  But Princess Beatrice’s reaction might have been the sweetest of them all. The royal’s jaw immediately dropped after her friend flashed her new engagement ring. But what’s even more noteworthy is the Instagram handle Kloss tagged over the screenshot — @beayork, which is Princess Beatrice’s private account. (Her official title is Princess Beatrice of York.) Followers include Beatrice’s mom, Sarah Ferguson, Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, and supermodel Cara Delevigne. The 1,021 people she follows is set to private.  Princess Beatrice and Karlie Kloss Karlie Kloss/Instagram  Beatrice’s Instagram might be a secret, but it’s not exactly breaking royal protocol. Royals with formal working roles, like Prince Harry, Prince William, Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle, are not allowed to have their own social media accounts (they use the official palace accounts), but for those who have jobs outside the family, it’s permitted.

"One of the more romantic scenes in Lifetime's take on everyone's favorite royal duo, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, involves the wedding of someone the couple is only tangentially related to: Pippa Middleton, sister of Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge. In the made-for-TV movie, the almost-royal is excluded from a pretty significant Middleton family gathering (ahem, our girl Pippa's wedding ceremony) and as it turns out, the real Meghan Markle wasn't at Pippa's wedding ceremony, either — but she managed to make it to the reception.  In the movie, the fictional Markle is on the phone with her mother, slightly sad about being left out, when Harry bursts in to take her to the party after all — where she met Harry's parents for the first time. In the film, Kate Middleton blames her sister's ""no ring, no bring"" policy — meaning only engaged or married couples were allowed — for Markle being benched. (In real life and in the movie, Markle and the prince were not yet betrothed.)  As it turns out, this plus one policy was the real deal, but as PEOPLE noted, both James Middleton's longtime girlfriend Donna Air and Princess Eugenie's longtime boyfriend Jack Brooksbank attended the ceremony. Additionally, according to The Telegraph, Markle was fully invited to Middleton's May 2017 wedding despite the ""no ring no bring"" policy, but at the last moment Markle did not appear at the ceremony itself. So what gives?  The way PEOPLE told the story, Harry left after the ceremony and drove 90 minutes back to London to pick up his then girlfriend from Kensington Palace where she was cooped up. According to Vanity Fair, Markle had been seen in London before the wedding and everything seemed good to go. E! news reported that Markle skipped out of the ceremony so as not to draw attention to a wedding that was not her own and upstage the couple on their special day. (For the record, The Daily Beast was already speculating whether or not Markle would steal the show, as many once thought Pippa did at her sister's wedding, before the big day even arrived.) It's also possible there was concern that the paparazzi, who mobbed Markle at every chance, would make for unruly and unwelcome wedding guests. The Mirror speculates that it was always the plan for Markle to attend the reception, despite laying low for the wedding itself, and that Prince Harry's last-minute drive was simply so she wouldn't have to arrive alone. (Bustle reached out to Kensington Palace for comment but did not hear back.)  courtesy of Lifetime  Unfortunately for that wasn't the end of the drama. There was still some slight scandal when The Mirror reported that Markle's black dress and white cape was a sombre fashion faux pas for a wedding reception. The Lifetime movie leaves this bit out, making Markle's reception dress red, and any real life faux pas doesn't seem to have affected any permanent damage on Markle's relationship with the Royals in 2018.  Oh, but there's more: The wedding reception scene in the Lifetime movie takes additional steps to mix fiction with reality for the sake of drama by including a fictional relative named Lady Violet, who wears an offensive brooch to the wedding. The scene calls to mind a heated racist brooch trolling debacle — in which Princess Michael of Kent caught fire for wearing a blackamoor brooch, with an exotic and offensive depiction of an African person, to a luncheon attended by Markle. The Princess later apologized and claimed not to have worn something so offensive to Markle intentionally, but in the Lifetime movie, Harry warns this fictional Lady Violet about the same brooch, months before the luncheon would have taken place — which is a pretty shady twist on the real life story.  And look, there was probably a decent amount of actual family drama at Pippa's wedding — the Royals are humans, after all, and humans get dramatic at weddings. But clearly, the Lifetime movie plays up it all up for our amusement — likely far more than anything that actually happened in real life."

We're told it's ""not true.""  ""Grammys Ruined For Adele! Singer Stranded Without Her Team,"" blares a new RadarOnline headline. The accompanying article goes on to purport that the singer is ""freaking out"" because she's alone in Los Angeles while her crew is snowed in out east. A so-called ""source"" tells the site, ""Adele is panicked that her team will not make it out in time. Some key players were scheduled to fly west tomorrow but have just been cancelled by the airline.""  The outlet's dubious insider adds, ""With so many cancellations it looks like the show will have to go on without them."" But despite many flights having been cancelled on Thursday morning, the worst of the storm has since passed, and many airlines have resumed service as of the afternoon. Additionally, it's expected that the airports will be fully operational again by Friday morning.  Regardless, Gossip Cop checked in with a reliable source close to Adele, who exclusively assures us that the singer isn't concerned about the blizzard ""ruining"" the Grammys for her, and the claim otherwise is simply ""not true.""

"If a picture speaks a thousand words, then the Instagram accounts of Jennifer Lopez and boyfriend Alex Rodriguez could tell one epic story. Within hours of each other on Jan. 24, the former Yankee slugger posted a photo of a cryptic quote: “There’s nothing wrong with making a mistake, what’s wrong is not making the effort to make it right,” and the Shades of Blue star shared a photo of a gigantic bouquet of flowers Alex had sent her. The next day, she uploaded a selfie and captioned the photo, “It’s all in God’s hands always,” along with the hashtag #letgoandletgod. According to an insider, “That was aimed directly at Alex.”  Hollywood’s hottest duo is on the verge of flaming out. Jennifer, 48, is privately questioning her relationship with her boyfriend of nearly a year after learning he’s still in touch with former fling Lauren Hunter, a fitness model, who last year claimed in an interview that Alex, 42, had been sexting her for months — including while he was dating J.Lo. Recently, “someone went to Jennifer with new details that Alex was still texting with Lauren, and that’s what made Jennifer lose it,” the insider tells In Touch. “Of course, he said it wasn’t physical, and maybe it wasn’t, but in Jennifer’s book, that’s still cheating. They were head-over-heels in love and planning to get engaged. Now Alex’s actions have jeopardized everything.”  The damage runs deep. Jennifer, who’s endured three failed marriages, “was heartbroken to hear that Alex was talking to Lauren,” says the insider. “Even though they didn’t meet in person, Jennifer considered it a betrayal. Now she has friends and family watching out for her best interests, which means checking in and asking about Alex’s antics.”  She has good reason to worry. Last June, a month after Jennifer and Alex made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in NYC, Lauren claimed in a bombshell interview that she was in frequent contact with the ex-athlete, whom she met at an Equinox gym in 2011. “A week before his relationship with Jennifer was announced, he was asking me to go to Miami,” she claimed. “He never even mentioned her.” Lauren also alleged that Alex (who has kids Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis) cheated on then-girlfriend Cameron Diaz with her in 2011. Jennifer “would be an idiot to believe he’d be faithful,” she said. She also called Jennifer too vanilla for him. “I don’t think he’s sexually attracted to her,” she dished. “In bed... he's probably picturing me.""  Jennifer, mom to nine-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex Marc Anthony, turned a blind eye to the initial interview. Now, she’s not sure what to believe. “Jennifer’s still on the fence,” says the insider. “She can either cut her losses and walk away from the relationship, or she can fight for it. I think she’ll fight for it.”  More from In Touch  Alex Rodriguez Encourages New Girlfriend Jennifer Lopez to “Sex up” Her Wardrobe (EXCLUSIVE)  Jennifer Lopez Hints That She Has Made a Sex Tape — Watch the Scandalous Clip!

"Lil Dicky's ""Freaky Friday"" featuring Chris Brown was an unforeseen smash hit for the Philly comedy-rapper, debuting at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. The success of Dicky's bonkers track about switching bodies with Brown seemed to leave the rapper himself in awe, telling Billboard recently: ""It's validating to see a song be so mainstream while being so quirky and weird.""

"Khloé Kardashian, just welcomed her first child — a baby girl! — amid rampant speculation about Tristan Thompson‘s alleged infidelities.  A source previously told PEOPLE that though Kardashian, 33, was devastated, she would remain focused on motherhood, explaining that the scandal “doesn’t change that Khloé has dreamed of becoming a mom.”  It’s also not the first time the Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star has faced similar rumors. Before she was romantically linked to NBA boyfriend Thompson in September 2016, Kardashian dealt with allegations of extramarital affairs during her nearly eight-year relationship with ex-husband Lamar Odom.  A source close to Odom, 38, told PEOPLE recently that “Lamar feels terrible for Khloé. He wasn’t sure if he should reach out and see how she’s doing. He feels for her.”  Kardashian and Odom wed on Sept. 27, 2009 — one month to the day after they met (and nine days after getting engaged) — but the marriage fell apart after the former basketball player’s cheating scandal and drug relapse, which led Kardashian to file for divorce in 2013.  Watch the full special Born Kardashian streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.  Cheating rumors against Odom first circulated in January 2012, when a tabloid report claimed Odom cheated on Kardashian with a woman he met at a Washington, D.C., strip club. And in July 2013, the pair were confronted rumors claiming Odom had been unfaithful to Kardashian after playing a game for the Dallas Mavericks.  RELATED: Everything We Know About Khloé Kardashian’s Romance with Tristan Thompson (So Far)  JAKE HOLLY/startraksphoto.com  “Love is blind … Lamar was so great at making me feel like I was the only one and I’m this princess. I never speculated cheating … so I didn’t know about cheating … until before the DUI [in 2013],” Kardashian told Howard Stern in January 2016.  “He was so good. So nothing was on his cell phones, [but] he had an assistant. They were all on his assistant’s phone, so he was really crafty,” she recalled as Stern asked the former Kocktails with Khloé host: “Doesn’t that feel awful when the assistant knows, and everyone knows?” To which Kardashian agreed, “Oh, it’s disgusting.”  RELATED GALLERY: Khloé Kardashian & Lamar Odom: A Timeline of Their Relationship  “But all these rumors kept coming out in the weeklies, and as much as I know they’re bull—-, where there’s smoke there’s fire. Something has to be right here,” Kardashian revealed. “It is humiliating on any level, but I found out he was cheating on me the majority of our marriage, I just didn’t know.”  In October 2015, Odom was rushed to the hospital after being found unconscious in a Nevada brothel. Near death, he spent four days in a coma, and Kardashian rushed to his side and called off their divorce proceedings temporarily.  Imeh Akpanudosen/Getty; JB Lacroix/WireImage  Months before, in July 2015, both stars had signed divorce papers, but the judgment had not yet been entered in court by the time Odom was hospitalized; thus, they were technically still legally married. As a result, Kardashian was making all of Odom’s medical decisions.  Upon his recovery, Odom completed a 30-day drug rehab program.  Khloé refiled for divorce once Odom recovered from the Nevada incident, and their split was finalized in December 2016.  RELATED: Khloé Kardashian Opens Up About Lamar Odom’s Harrowing Ordeal: I’ll Always Be There for Him  RELATED VIDEO: Khloé Kardashian’s BFF Khadijah Haqq Takes Aim at Tristan Thompson During Cheating Scandal  In July 2017, Odom penned an emotional first-person essay for The Players’ Tribune in which he touched on how his drug addiction and infidelity tore apart his marriage.  “Anybody who’s lived a complicated, drug-infused life like I’ve lived knows the cycle — with women, cheating on my wife, s— like that,” he wrote.  Jerritt Clark/Getty Images  One of his “darkest” moments, he admitted, was when Kardashian caught him doing drugs with another woman. “I was in a motel room, getting high with this chick, and my wife (at the time) walked in. That probably was like rock bottom. First of all I was in a motel. A motel,” he remembered.  “I’m a millionaire. I’d made it out of Jamaica, Queens, and won two NBA titles. And I’m in a motel, with some random person, doing coke. But I just wanted to get high with this girl, and I had no other place to go. I couldn’t take her home. You know, I was being a scumbag,” he wrote.  Odom still thinks highly of Kardashian. Asked in January by BET’s Mancave about Khloé being pregnant, Odom said he’s “happy for her,” adding, “She took care of me, she’ll be a good mother. For real. She’s a great woman.”  Now, a source told PEOPLE that when Kardashian got together with Thompson, her sisters were “really happy to see Khloe so excited about someone again because she hadn’t felt that way about a guy since Lamar. Eventually Tristan won over her family too … he really seemed dedicated to her, so this must be a shock to everyone.”"

"Ever since Jennifer Aniston married Justin Theroux, pregnancy rumors have followed the couple. Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  “Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one’s business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people’s choices.  Advertisement  What is right for her, may not be right for someone else; and, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors."

"Tennessee middle-schooler Keaton Jones is opening up about life after his anti-bullying video, revealing that he hasn’t returned to school since the footage spread across the Internet.  The 11-year-old and his mother, Kimberly Jones, appeared on British talk show This Morning on Thursday where they said they aren’t sure when Keaton will return to Horace Maynard Middle School in Maynardville, Tennessee.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I actually haven’t been to school,” he said. He added of his bullies: “Why do you bully? What’s the point of it? It makes me feel awful.”  This Morning/ITV  Kimberly said that Keaton expressed that he didn’t want to return even to the middle school even “when the whole world wanted to come and eat lunch with him.”  “I’ve struggled anyway especially being this close to Christmas break, but after seeing how big it got, I mean it just seems like maybe we should let it die down a little bit before we made any decisions so that we could kind of have a reality of what life is gonna be like,” she continued.  Love What Matters/Facebook  Keaton, of Knoxville, captivated the Internet earlier this month after a video uploaded by his mother showed the boy in tears as he lamented the bullying he’s endured at school. In the video, Keaton revealed that the bullies, “make fun of my nose. They call me ugly. They say I have no friends.”  However, Keaton’s emotional story took a turn when photos surfaced showing the family with Confederate flags. They faced more criticism when rumors circulated that the family used Keaton’s story for financial gain.  “I’ve said over and over, I’m an adult, I know who I am. I’m obviously sorry that it has offended so many people, but the backlash to my children…” Kimberly said during the morning show. “That’s something I wouldn’t wish on anybody.”  She added that the backlash has “brought the bullies out.” Kimberly also denied being racist in interviews with ABC and CBS News.  As the backlash seemingly began to subside, the family faced a new wave of criticism as photos from the Facebook page of Shawn White, Keaton’s allegedly estranged father, showed him sharing white supremacist propaganda. The pictures prompted Keaton’s older sister, Lakyn Jones, to defend her family in a tweet.  Henry Winkler Offers a Powerful Message Following Tennessee Student’s Viral Anti-Bullying Video  “You all can go look back at every tweet from every father’s & mother’s day to see that all we have is our mom,” Lakyn wrote on her Twitter account on Wednesday. “We have no contact with our dads. BECAUSE of their actions. That’s why all the articles say ‘estranged’ because we don’t talk to them. Leave us alone.”  Family friend Kaley Katz worked to shut down the criticism, telling PEOPLE that the accusations of racism are “rumors” and that it’s not true that Keaton is the target of bullying because he used a racial slur.  “The rumors are fake,” family friend Kaley Katz tells PEOPLE. “She is not a racist, Keaton did not bully anyone at his school, and she did not start the GoFundMe account in order for it to be a scam.”"

"Lindsay Lohan says she was “racially profiled” at London’s Heathrow Airport after flying in from Turkey because she was wearing a headscarf.  The Mean Girls actress, 30, said she was stopped by a woman who asked her to take her headscarf off. “She opened my passport and saw Lindsay Lohan and started immediately apologizing, but then said ‘But please take off your headscarf,'” Lohan told U.K. television show Good Morning Britain. She added: “And I did, it’s okay. But what scared me was in that moment — how would another woman who doesn’t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel?”  Lohan, who has been photographed carrying a Koran and says she finds “solace” studying the Muslim holy book, said she didn’t know why she was asked to take her headscarf off but found the experience “really jarring.” She told hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid: “I’m from New York — I’m born and raised there, but I was a little intimidated.”  When Reid asked the Parent Trap star why she was wearing the headscarf, she said it was “out of respect” for the Turkish women she had met with on her trip. “I was… leaving Turkey and… when I see certain people I feel more comfortable acting the same way as the other women — that’s just a personal respect issue for me that I have,” she said.  When Morgan asked Lohan about her views on President Donald Trump, Lohan said she thought he should be given a fair chance. “I don’t agree with his policies and the things he is doing,” she said. “But at the end of the day he is the president right now. So what’s the point of picking on someone instead of seeing what they’re capable — or not capable — of.” However, she added that she did think his Twitter account should be taken away “or deleted.” Watch the clip below:"

"In the past, Kanye’s capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades. It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — one of the greatest rap albums of all time — without an “Imma let you finish” at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn’t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn’t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month’s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist’s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‘I Thought About Killing You’, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‘No Mistakes’, to keep his fans just interested enough. It’s telling that the one standout track, ‘Ghost Town’ is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn’t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he’s become blasé and doesn’t want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway."
"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Elle King‘s wedding day was anything but textbook.  On Saturday, the “Ex’s and Oh’s” singer was set to wed fiancé Andrew “Fergie” Ferguson but was actually at an Eagles of Death Metal concert in Seattle instead.  “Skipped out on my wedding. I married Rock&Roll instead so I hopped on tour with EAGLES OF F–KING DEATH METAL,” King shared on Instagram.  The daughter of comedian Rob Schneider, King, 27, accepted Ferguson’s proposal last February after he popped the question on a sailboat under the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. As King recalled on a March episode of “Say Yes to the Dress,” Ferguson proposed 12 days after they met.  “We met in London in the lobby of my hotel, and it was like we had known each other for 10 years,” she said. “We hung out all night, it was my last day in London, and he was like, ‘You can’t go home.’ And I didn’t get on my flight, and I stayed in London. Two days later, he quit his job and moved to America.”  While she found her dream dress, King hinted the pair had split following a cryptic Instagram post from March 28.  “Gotta say … no matter how heartbreaking one day may be, it’s hard to not smile in this California sunshine,” she wrote.  Earlier this month, King penned a lengthy note detailing the importance of self-worth.  “Been a really rough and insane start to this year,” King shared, along with a snapshot of her puppy. “Lately I don’t cry very much. I feel like it will just be an explosion if I did. But seeing my little baby girl again, and having her by my side, well I lost it. She’s my best friend and the only true loyalty I’ve ever known.  “Today someone tried to make me feel a certain way about myself. But we have to remember, no one can make you feel anything unless you let them. Don’t give people power over you. As a human, other people may try to be threatening in more ways than just verbal or physical acts,” she continued. “Always be strong. Always have dogs. Never forget your rights and your worth. If no one has told you today, I love you and I think you’re beautiful and are worthy of love and kindness. Be safe. Be smart. Don’t let anyone make you feel fearful or small. Love yourself.”  A rep for King did not immediately return a request for comment."

"Rihanna Brings In Her Dirty 30s With Toni Braxton And Paris Hilton  Rihanna is seen coolin' with her shooters at her 30th birthday celebration.  From red carpets and special events to everyday mundane tasks, Rihanna always keeps her Day Ones close. Rihanna celebrated her 30th birthday Tuesday night (Feb. 22) in NYC and although it was a star-studded guest list, her woes were there to toast it up.  The four ladies are seen posed together in Rihanna’s Instagram post, captioned “gang.” as they cheese for the camera, decked out in party gowns and champagne glasses. Her squad—Melissa Forde, Leandra Simone and Dr. Sonita Alexander—have been with the bad gal since they were children in Barbados. Forde has become a familiar face, showing up with the “Loyalty” singer in several photos and parties.  Rihanna pulled up to the swanky black-tie dinner with close friends and family at The Grill in a magenta and black Saint Laurent bubble dress fresh off the runway. After caviar, peppered filet mignon and popped bottles, Page Six reports there was an after party next door to the restaurant at The Pool.  Guests of the after party included RiRi’s family, friends, Toni Braxton, Shawn Pecas, OG Juan Perez and other Roc Nation executives, Paris Hilton, Leonardo DiCaprio and her beau Hassan Jameel. Braxton even sang for her. What a way to bring in a milestone.  Surrounded by love and light, the “Diamonds” singer has high hopes for her 30 era."
"Though Brad Pitt hasn’t confirmed that he’s dating MIT professor Neri Oxman, the mere thought of him moving on reportedly sent a ‘jealous’ Angelina Jolie into a fit of rage!  Brad Pitt, 54, has reportedly struck up a relationship with renowned architect Neri Oxman, 42. While some of Brad’s friends, like George Clooney, 56, hope that this friendship leads to something more serious, the Fight Club actor’s ex, Angelina Jolie, 42, was furious to hear that Brad may be dating again. She “flew into such a rage that she collapsed” when she heard the rumors that Brad Pitt started dating MIT professor Neri Oxman, a source told Star magazine. “She was ranting one minute and then the next, she just sort of crumpled.”  “Angie can’t stand anyone who’s smarter and prettier than her,” Star’s source claims, before adding that Angie thinks it is absolutely “galling that Brad has managed to keep his connection Neri hush-hush for months. Angie is very jealous and competitive, and she wanted to be the first one to start a hot new relationship. If it turns out that Brad beat her to the punch, it could be humiliating.”  Angie was taken off guard by the reports of Brad spending time with Neri, as sources EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com that “a MIT professor is the last person Angie would have picked for Brad.” Well, he reportedly wants to find a woman who “challenges” him, and after seeing how happy George is after marrying a much smarter, more powerful woman – in Amal Clooney, 40 – dating a woman from the halls of academia doesn’t seem that far-fetched. “Brad has been ready for a new relationship for a while now,” the source tells Star, “and Neri is just the sort of woman he needs.”  Angie may need a stiff drink and a moment to find her chill if Brad and Neri take this rumored relationship to the next level. Though, when it comes to her reportedly being “humiliated” at being “beaten to the punch,” there were reports that Angie actually found love first. She supposedly started up a romance with an “older-looking man who is a real estate agent,” ET Online reported in March 2018. This man, who “isn’t a celebrity or high profile in any way,” gave her quite a boost, as having “another adult to spend time with” was just what the doctor ordered."
"The famous pair shared the stage as they introduced previews for Cruise’s upcoming film Mission: Impossible – Fallout and Fonda’s Book Club – their flirty banter not going unnoticed by the audience.  According to onlookers, their flirting was evident to everyone and they couldn’t keep their hands off each other.  ‘Tom was hanging on Jane’s every word, and she was touching his arm repeatedly and having a lot of fun – it was clear that they were really enjoying one another’s company. In fact, some were even wondering if there was more to their obvious connection and whether their chemistry would eventuate into something more. The flirting was off the scale.’  Jane, 80, who is famous for looking younger than her years and separating from her longtime boyfriend Richard Perry last year, is in the middle of a career renaissance and shows no sign of slowing down.  Tom, 55, has also enjoyed renewed success with a string of hit action films, and was last rumoured to be dating his Fallout co-star Vanessa Kirby.  ‘Tom and Jane were certainly very taken with each other and everyone was talking about it,’ an insider tells New Idea.  ‘They spent a couple of hours together, laughing and talking – it was really like there was no-one else at the party.  ‘Sure, Jane is a little older than Tom – but he’s had older girlfriends before and this is the first woman in a really long time who’s managed to captivate him.  ‘Tom was left feeling a little shell-shocked after his split from Katie, but he really wants to put himself back out there and find love again,’ the source added.

"Blake Shelton just nabbed another major honor, and it’s not a country music award. The singer and The Voice coach was named People’s Sexiest Man Alive for 2017.  So, what did he think when he first heard the news? “That y’all must be running out of people,” he told People. “Like, Wow, we’re down to somebody who is somewhat symmetrical.""  Surely his girlfriend of two years, Gwen Stefani, agrees with the title. “I think he’s hot.

"The custody battle between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie just heated up, with a judge ordering new restrictions for Jolie’s involvement in Pitt’s interaction with their six children.  According to court documents obtained by PEOPLE, Jolie could be in danger of losing primary custody of the children if she doesn’t take steps to improve their relationship with their father. A judge in the couple’s ongoing divorce case said in the documents that “it is critical that each of [the six] children have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother,” and that Jolie must allow Pitt to maintain and repair that.  Family law attorney David Glass, who is not associated with the case, tells PEOPLE that it “is extremely rare” to see a court intervene in this way, though they typically do so after extensive evaluation and to prevent children from being alienated from one parent.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Jason Merritt/Getty  “It looks like what this judge was weighing was the difference between estrangement and alienation,” says Glass, who has not had access to the court documents. “The difference there is, estrangement is when children aren’t connected to one of the parents, mainly because of something that parent did. So a hypothetical, if dad screams and yells at the kids and doesn’t treat them nicely, the kids stop wanting to see dad, that’s estrangement. An alienation refers to where children have been told by the other parent that the parent they’re not seeing is bad, or doesn’t like them, or doesn’t care about them. Just talking badly about the other parent and the kids start to internalize what the other parent is telling them. In alienation cases, kids will typically just repeat words that are beyond their years, or they will repeat reasons that they don’t possibly have access to the information.”  He adds: “It’s a rare case where the court will find that someone alienated the kids. It takes a lot to move the court past estrangement into alienation, but once it’s determined that one parent is alienating the kids, the court has no choice but to jump in and make pretty strong orders right away.”  The judge also outlined specific steps Jolie should take to aid Pitt’s access to and relationship with the children, including a detailed summer visitation schedule, and easy phone access between Pitt and each of the kids, without monitoring or interference from their mom. Glass says that the goal of the new guidelines is to “try to figure out what’s in the children’s best interest.”  Angelina Jolie, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt and Zahara Jolie-Pitt in 2018. Dia Dipasupil/FilmMagic  “The schedule worked out by the court is the typical post-alienation reunification schedule,” he says. “You see them a couple hours a day and that starts leading to full days and eventually if things go well it leads to overnights, so you’re slowly acclimating the kids to the parent who’s been cut out of the kids lives.”  RELATED VIDEO: Brad Pitt Is ‘in a Better Place’ Amid Divorce Proceedings with Angelina Jolie: Source  According to the court documents, the kids have to continue to see their therapist with Pitt, which Glass says is a positive step.  “That’s the first good news, that the kids are in therapy and that dad is somehow involved in the therapy. That’s where the kids can work out whatever issues they have. It’s that continuing contact with dad … all those little pieces that eventually lead to some sort of reunification with their dad.”  Reps for both Jolie, 43, and Pitt, 54, have not yet responded to a request for comment. Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt on September 19, 2016. The have six children: Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and 9-year old twins Vivienne and Knox."
"It is being reported that Australia is becoming the first nation in the world to begin microchipping its citizens. This surprising new development is the result of several years of a sustained propaganda that has actually led to Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the controversial program.Australia is getting its citizens microchippedShanti Korporaal, who lives in the Australian city of Sydney has found herself at the center of headlines of the new venture after having implants surgically implanted in both of her hands. She says that she has no regrets about the procedure and that she encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The implants are fitted with a unique identifier which can be used to get through locked doors, to transfer personal information into devices and even connected to bank details. ""You could set up your life, so you never have to worry about any passwords or PINs, ""Korporaal told reporters when justifying her decision. Another anonymous individual who had also voluntarily undergone the procedure said that they had done it for the purpose of ‘convenience.'But while it may be convenient in the short-term, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted directly into the human body are terrifying. Modern technology has allowed the government and law enforcement agencies an almost unprecedented level of access to the details of the lives of ordinary citizens. In the United States, there are regular reports that indicate that law enforcement agencies such as the police and the FBI are already tracking cell phones without a warrant on a fairly routine basis. In addition to this, revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the government is accessing and storing a vast amount of information about every single person, whether they are under suspicion or not, from their online devices.This means that civil liberties campaigners are deeply concerned about this burgeoning trend of microchipping which will essentially allow the government to have a permanent record of a citizen’s every movement and transaction. After all, the only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is another painful operation. Civil liberties advocates are baffled by the way private citizens are actually volunteering to forego their privacy and security in such an intrusive manner."

"Don’t expect the arrival of Khloé Kardashian’s first child to heal old wounds. In a new interview, the pregnant reality star said that having a baby won’t mend her estranged relationship with Caitlyn Jenner.  “I don’t think that affects anything with Caitlyn,” Kardashian, 33, told Ross King on the U.K. morning show Lorraine on Thursday, February 8. “[Things are] just as they are.”  Jenner’s relationship with the Kardashian family has been rocky since the Olympian, 68, revealed her identity as a transgender woman in April 2015. Two years later, the estrangement worsened after the release of Jenner’s memoir, The Secrets of My Life, in which she claimed that ex-wife Kris Jenner — who is Kardashian’s mother — was not supportive of her transition. (Kris and Caitlyn, formerly Bruce, were married from 1991 to 2015 and share daughters Kendall, 22, and Kylie, 20.)  Caitlyn opened up about the family feud in November. “It’s been a little bit tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,” she admitted while speaking to students at Cambridge Union in England at the time. “To be honest, I don’t talk to them anymore. Kim, I haven’t talked to in a year. They don’t want me in their lives. They bashed me pretty badly. It’s devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt.”  The I Am Cait alum still has a close relationship with Kendall and Kylie, though. In fact, a source recently told Us Weekly exclusively that Caitlyn has already met the Lip Kit creator’s newborn daughter, Stormi. The proud grandparent later confirmed the news on Instagram, writing, “My daughter just had a daughter. It’s amazing to be by your side through this journey. She’s SO beautiful already. Can’t wait to watch her grow.”  Meanwhile, Khloé is seven months pregnant with her first child, a boy, with her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson.

"New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady faced criticism on social media this week for kissing his 11-year-old son on the lips during a scene from his new docuseries “Tom vs. Time.”  In the scene, Mr. Brady is getting a massage on his shoulder when his son, Jack, entered the room to ask if he could check on his fantasy football team.  “I was wondering if I could check my fantasy team?” the boy asked his dad.  “What do I get?” Mr. Brady replied.  That’s when Jack walked over to his dad and leaned over to kiss him on the mouth.  “Everything comes with a cost, bud,” the message therapist quipped.  “That was like a peck,” Mr. Brady complained.  Jack walked over again and kissed his father on the mouth a second time, for what some people called an “uncomfortably long” time — roughly two and half seconds.  Can we talk about Tom Brady’s uncomfortably long kiss with his son or is now not a good time?https://t.co/zCw7egz4Lv pic.twitter.com/HA0NcckI6s — Brett Bachman (@BrettABachman) February 2, 2018  A CBS News affiliate in New York asked people on the street what they thought of the kiss.  “I’m a little uncomfortable with that,” one passerby said.  “I think at a certain age it’s like OK you can kiss them on the cheek; you can give ‘em a hug,” mother-of-two Emily Hernandez told the station. “But not in the mouth and not for that long.”  “Too long, like romantic long,” added Parrish Watson.  Others had no issues with it.  “I kiss my son on his lips,” one dad said. “I have since day one. I would have no problem with my son kissing me like that.”  This is not the first time people have taken issue with Mr. Brady’s shows of affection, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted. He sparked controversy last year after he was photographed kissing his father on the lips after his Super Bowl win against the Atlanta Falcons.      Copyright © 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

"Tarek El Moussa and his ex-wife Christina have been making headlines due to their recent divorce, but one thing that Tarek doesn't have to worry about is money. The couple has also announced that they will continue to work together on their HGTV show Flip or Flop, which will only add to their hefty bank accounts. So just how much is Tarek El Moussa worth?  According to Celebrity Net Worth, Tarek had a net worth of $4 million while he was married to Christina, and The Huffington Post also noted that the couple's net worth was $4 million. While his accountant is the only one to know for sure, it would be safe to bet that he is still doing just fine financially after the divorce. Based on what they've made together on the show and his profits from his house flipping business, it's certainly no surprise to see Tarek has made so much over the years—but it wasn't always like that for the couple.  In 2008, after the housing market crash, the then-couple had to move out of their lush house and move into a $700-per-month apartment to stay afloat, according to The Ocean County Register. They continued to work on their business and in 2011, Tarek and a close friend rented a video camera and filmed their own audition tape for an HGTV show. The video worked, and the El Moussas had their first season of 13 episodes OF Flip or Flop ordered.  On top of the money that they made from flipping the houses and selling them, the couple also made $10,000 per episode, according to The Ocean County Register. They are also co-producers on Chi-Town Flip, a Flip or Flop spin-off that takes follows husband and wife Bryan and Maria Segal in Chicago, Deadline notes.    After the divorce, Tarek purchased a 3,010-square-foot home for $2.28 million. He also recently rebranded his realtor business, Tarek & Associates, according to Realtor.com, where he continues to buy properties and flip them. He said that although Christina's name is not on the business anymore, he will still continue to work with her. Despite their split, the former power couple is certainly keeping the money rolling in."
"Like those holographic snakes that periodically go viral on Twitter, eye shadow palettes are simultaneously beautiful and terrifying things. The myriad of matte and metallic shades look stunning, but the thought of getting a selection of them onto lids without looking like a child's art project gone wrong can scare people away from them entirely. Without the right blending, the shadows could end up looking muddy, splotchy, patchy, or harsh. Cringe. The word ""blending"" in and of itself freaks some people out. Trust and believe that there's nothing to be afraid of. Unlike those holographic snakes, eye shadow doesn't have fangs.  I asked a handful of professional makeup artists to demystify eye shadow blending, and I swear blending is easier than it looks with their tips. You don't have to be giving celebrities perfectly diffused smoky eyes all day and all night to master the technique.  Before you do anything, though, don't do anything at all. If you ask Patrick Ta, a professional makeup artist who's worked with Gigi Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski, your eye makeup should be applied before the rest of your makeup. ""I always say to do your eyes first to avoid fall-out from your eye shadows,"" Ta tells Allure. ""If you prefer to do your face first, you can use Shadow Shields to avoid this as well.""  OK, now that we have that out of the way, here are five steps to eye shadow blending.  1. Prime for success.  If you're going to take the time out of your busy day to blend your shadow to perfection, you might as well smooth some eye shadow primer onto your lids to keep everything in place. Amy Strozzi, who's worked with Rowan Blanchard and Aly & AJ, tells Allure, ""I keep it closer to the lash line and fade it as I go upward so I have more flexibility to blend in the crease area."" Then let it dry for at least 10 seconds before moving on to the main event.  Need a primer rec? Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion is always a good choice. Allure editors also love Too Faced Shadow Insurance.  Primer isn't required for pro blending, though. Many makeup artists, like Mario Dedivanovic, would rather skip it. Instead, he prefers to tap leftover foundation or concealer onto lids to give the shadows some grip.  2. Pick your tools.  Depending on which makeup artist you ask, you're going to get a different answer for what the best blending brush is. Regardless, ""flawless eye shadow blending is all about brushes,"" says Giselle Ali, who's worked with SZA and Cynthia Erivo. ""You have to have the right tools for the job. You can never have enough blending brushes, but two is good to start with."" The key is to keep both of these clean. Don't dip these into your eye shadow pans. Instead, use a denser brush like the Best of Beauty Award–winning E.L.F. Beautifully Precise Eyeshadow Brush No. 201 to lay down pigments before blending.  Ta swears by the Anastasia Beverly Hills A12 Small Contour Brush. Ali prefers the Sigma E40 Tapered Blending Brush.  Strozzi, on the other hand, has a completely different list of essentials. For blending powders all over the lid, the M.A.C. 224 Tapered Blending Brush is her ride-or-die. When focusing on the creases, she prefers the Smith Cosmetics 230 Quill Crease Brush. For cream shadows and powders that are on the denser side, she reaches for M.A.C.'s 234 Split Fibre Eye Blending Brush because ""one side is synthetic, which helps apply the product, and the other natural side is great for blending it out,"" she explains."
"CLOSE Actor Brian Dietzen weighs in on the impending departure of his ""NCIS"" co-star, popular actress Pauley Perrette. (Nov. 7) AP  Abby (Pauley Perrette) was seen hospitalized, and in imminent peril, after being shot in a street holdup in last week's 'NCIS' episode. (Photo: CBS)  Spoiler alert: If you haven't watched Tuesday's NCIS episode ""Two Steps Back,"" put your headphones on, crank up some Goth rock, refill your Caf-Pow cup and come back after you've seen it.  Leave it to NCIS forensics genius Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) to solve what first appeared to be her own murder.  Tuesday's ""Two Steps Back,"" which marked the final episode for Perrette after 15 seasons and more than 350 episodes, opened with Abby on the verge of death after a suffering a gunshot wound during a street holdup at the end of last week's episode.  Moments later, it appeared she was dead, as medical examiner Ducky Mallard (David McCallum) approached a covered body on the exam table and spoke about performing an autopsy on a colleague.  But, in a big fakeout, it was Clayton Reeves (Duane Henry), the big-hearted NCIS colleague who was with Abby when she was robbed, who had been killed.  Investigate: The common thread connecting Pauley Perrette's favorite 'NCIS' episodes  More:Perrette says fans will need 'a couple boxes of tissues' for Abby's 'NCIS' exit  As team leader Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), special agent Tim McGee (Sean Murray) and Dr. Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen) took turns standing vigil over a comatose Abby, her colleagues searched for the killer.  Blood found on Reeves led Gibbs and agent Ellie Bishop (Emily Wickersham) to the home of the shooter. They found him murdered, along with evidence that he had been hired to kill Abby.  Since Abby's sleuthing skills had put so many bad guys away, there were many suspects to consider. The hit CBS drama took a trip down its own villainy lane, as agents interrogated embezzler Terry Spooner (from Season 3's ""Bloodbath,"" one of Perrette's favorite episodes) and Alejandro Rivera (seen in several episodes, starting with Season 10's ""Obsession""), a Mexican Justice Department official and brother of a drug lord.  NCIS team leader Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) stands over Abby's hospital bed during Tuesday's episode of 'NCIS.' (Photo: Patrick McElhenney, CBS)  Finally, the agents tracked down their man, former Marine Corps Sgt. Major Robert King (Peter Jason), who had tricked Abby into developing a bioweapon until she stopped him in 2009's ""Toxic.""  In the meantime, Abby's healing abilities appeared to be even more amazing than her scientific skills: She was out of her coma and back in her cool, Goth-inspired apartment — the first time it had been seen on the show — before the fourth commercial break, ready to help the investigation.  Abby, now working from a computer in her kitchen, figured out that last week's mysterious restaurant invitation, which she shared with Reeves, was planned by her assailant. She tracked King's computer to a public wi-fi system, but pulled a fast one on Gibbs & Co., sending them to the wrong address.  In one of TV's longest-running cliches, which finds the hero refusing backup to face a killer alone, Abby — who had locked special agent Nick Torres (Wilmer Valderrama) in her coffin — went to the real address and confronted King, who had put a hit on her after escaping prison. She told him she was tired of her heroes dying, listing former colleagues Caitlin Todd, Jenny Shepard, Ned Dorneget, Ziva David and Reeves, while villains survived.

(Photo: Patrick McElhenney, CBS)  As King prepared to leave, Abby told him she put cyanide in his coffee, offering an antidote if he confessed. It wasn't exactly a move that would stand up in court, but it worked. (It also wasn't cyanide, as Abby gave King crushed Caf-Pow pills to trigger a caffeine jolt.) Gibbs and Torres arrested King.  Later, Abby returned to her lab and surprised her colleagues — minus Gibbs — with news that she was leaving NCIS immediately to oversee the charity that Reeves planned to start in honor of his late mother.  They reluctantly accepted her decision, although Palmer, speaking for his colleagues and many fans, said: ""The thought of you not being here, I just can't imagine it.""  ""You guys are my family and this is my home, but you have to go with your gut and my gut is telling me I have to go,"" she explained. (Perrette announced she was leaving in October.)  Tearful hugs followed, with especially long embraces for McGee and Ducky. She left the tiniest hint of a return but may have been humoring McGee when she said, ""It's not goodbye for good. It's goodbye for now.""  Abby (Pauley Perrette), facing the camera, shares a goodbye hug with NCIS agent Ellie Bishop (Emily Wickersham) in Abby's and Perrette's final 'NCIS' episode. (Photo: Patrick McElhenney, CBS)  The episode featured flashbacks focusing on the almost father-daughter bond between Gibbs and Abby, but Harmon and Perrette never appeared together in Abby's finale.  Gibbs was seen solo and from behind in Abby's hospital room, but never face to face , and Abby said a heartfelt goodbye via a letter left at his door. The NCIS leader eventually spotted her from his window standing across the street and the two shared virtual hugs and spoke in sign language as the camera cut back and forth between them. It was an odd and unsatisfying goodbye after such a long, deep relationship.  Abby ended the episode in her true NCIS home, her lab, packing up some dolls and leaving a copy of Abby's Lab for Dummies for the next forensics specialist. Those will be some huge boots to fill.

"Satan is a misunderstood guy who has been judged on his outward appearance rather than by “what he has to offer us as human beings” according to Miley Cyrus, who detailed her relationship with the devil in a Swedish radio interview.  Going as far as to claim that Satan is a “really nice guy“, the singer described Satan’s relationship with her as “fatherly and nurturing” before stopping abruptly and asking the radio hosts, “You guys are liberal, right? Uber liberal, right?“  After the hosts laughed and one of them said “Err, yeah, I guess you can call us that,” Cyrus laughed too and then admitted that “sometimes he [Satan] can be a bit naughty too. He can be pervy. But that is natural. It’s only religious maniacs who see a problem with natural things.”  “I have reached the point where my relationship with him is stronger than my relationship with my earthly father,” Cyrus said, making reference to her biological father, Billy Ray Cyrus.  Asked how Billy Ray feels about “taking a back seat to the devil“, Miley Cyrus said, “He doesn’t feel anything, I don’t think so anyway. I haven’t asked. But it’s not like my relationship with anyone else takes away anything from my relationship with Dad. It’s just different.”  Cyrus also claimed that she receives guidance from Satan “on a fairly regular basis.” Asked what kind of guidance, Cyrus said, “Everyday stuff. Normal stuff,” before explaining that Satan’s guidance is “better than Jesus’ guidance.“  “I’ve been there, done that. Jesus is ok. He’s boring, you know? He gave Satan a bad rap. Jesus is the goody two shoes with no life. I prayed to Satan last Friday. I was in a foreign city, I barely knew anyone. He spoke to me quietly, prompting me to dress like a boy.  “I went out into the street dressed like a boy and I just walked and walked, following his whispers. I found myself in a dark alley by some kind of industrial area. Two big guys, rough guys you know, they suddenly appeared and I don’t know, I guess you’d call it rape. They took me forcefully. Yeah, it was painful. But to be totally honest, the whole experience was transcendental.  “It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. When they were both finished, I started straight into their eyes and said “Hail Satan”.  “I’m not sure they understood but they appeared calmed by my words.”  Miley Cyrus’s Satanic confession is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the singer has shared with the devil. After starting her career with Disney, the pop star reinvented her image as a raunchy pop star, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as she rode to the top of the charts.  Since establishing herself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, the singer has attempted to tame her dark image, however the disturbing conversation she held with the Swedish radio hosts suggests she is far from a reformed character, and she has openly sold her soul to Satan.  The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting Satanism as a viable religious choice for those seeking spiritual guidance."

"Rihanna is killing the game right now. The pop star just launched her first makeup line, Fenty Beauty , her song with DJ Khaled, ""Wild Thoughts,"" is rocking the Billboard charts, and she's still hanging out with that Saudi billionaire she was first spotted kissing over the summer . (RiRi tried to hide him under an umbrella-ella last month , but the Internet wasn't fooled!) All of Rihanna's body-shamers need to sit down, because she's on top of the world.  But even though Rihanna is ubiquitous, there's still a lot we don't know about her—as this new interview with Elle proves. The singer covers several topics during her recent chat with the magazine—including why lipstick is her ""secret weapon""—but the most interesting tidbit involves time travel.  One of Rihanna's friends, magician David Copperfield, asked her where she'd go if she was magically zapped anywhere in the world, and her answer was pretty surprising.  ""Ten minutes before I lost my virginity,"" Rihanna told Copperfield, who said that he actually can make her disappear and reappear any place on Earth. (Not sure if he was kidding or not.)  Interesting, right? There was no follow-up to this question. Rihanna didn't explain why she'd transport back to the day she lost her virginity or when exactly this was. It's a curious thought, though. Losing your virginity is typically a very awkward and vulnerable experience. I certainly wouldn't want to repeat that day—it seems like Rihanna might want to prevent it from happening altogether.  Leave it to Rihanna to give the most mysterious and intriguing answer to this question. Most people would've just said the Bahamas. OK, I would've said the Bahamas.

"CLOSE Barbara Pierce Bush, the former first lady, died at her Houston home Tuesday after a long struggle with congestive heart failure and pulmonary disease. The down-to-earth matriarch who saw both her husband and son win the White House, was 92. USA TODAY  Former first lady Barbara Bush (Photo: Tom Pennington, Getty Images)  Former first lady Barbara Bush, the wife of one president and mother of another, died Tuesday after deciding to discontinue medical treatment for her declining health.  Family spokesman Jim McGrath announced her death on Twitter at 6:37 p.m. CT: ""A former first lady of the United States of America and relentless proponent of family literacy, Barbara Pierce Bush passed away Tuesday, April 17, 2018 at the age of 92.""  Bush had made the decision to discontinue medical treatment for congestive heart failure and lung disease after consulting with her family and friends, McGrath announced Sunday. ""It will not surprise those who know her that Barbara Bush has been a rock in the face off her failing health, worrying not for herself – thanks to her abiding faith – but for others,"" he said.  With her iconic gray hair, quick wit and devotion to her husband of more than 70 years, she became the matriarch of one of the most influential political families of modern times.  Her husband George H.W. Bush, the nation’s 41st president from 1989-93, is now 93 years old and struggling with a Parkinson’s-like disease that forces him to use a wheelchair and has made it difficult for him to speak.  Her eldest son George W. Bush, now 71 and the nation's 43rd president, served two terms from 2001-09 and retired to Texas. His election made Barbara Bush the second woman in history to be both a wife and mother of presidents — and the only one who lived to see both of them serve.  ""My dear mother has passed on at age 92,"" her president-son said in a statement. ""Laura, Barbara, Jenna, and I are sad, but our souls are settled because we know hers was.""  ""Barbara Bush was a fabulous first lady and a woman unlike any other who brought levity, love, and literacy to millions. To us, she was so much more. Mom kept us on our toes and kept us laughing until the end. I’m a lucky man that Barbara Bush was my mother,"" he said.  Obituary: Barbara Bush, former first lady and matriarch of Bush family, dies at 92  As recently as 2014, Bush was tied with Hillary Clinton as the most popular first lady of the past 25 years, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found.  The Clintons remembered Bush Tuesday as a woman of ""grit and grace, brains and beauty.""  ""She was fierce and feisty in support of her family and friends, her country and her causes,"" former president Bill Clinton said in a statement. ""She showed us what an honest, vibrant, full life looks like. Hillary and I mourn her passing and bless her memory.""  Throughout a long life in the public eye, Bush was a fierce advocate for her husband and sons, including former Florida governor and presidential candidate Jeb Bush.  She also defended them against detractors, from those who criticized her husband's decision to raise taxes in 1990 to those who opposed her son's decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003.  Bush championed the issue of literacy before, during and after her White House years. She formed the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy to fund programs that teach parents in low-income families to read and pass on a love of reading to their children.  ""If everyone could read and write, all the problems I worried about could be solved,"" she told USA TODAY in 2014. ""If you can't read, you can't do anything.""  President Trump called her ""an advocate for the American family.""  ""Amongst her greatest achievements was recognizing the importance of literacy as a fundamental family value that requires nurturing and protection,"" Trump said in a statement through the White House press office. ""She will be long remembered for her strong devotion to country and family, both of which she served unfailingly well ""  He ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff in her honor Saturday when Bush is to be buried at her husband's presidential library in College Station, Texas.  Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen sent their ""deepest sympathies,"" calling Bush ""a woman of unique strength and grace whose devotion to her family was an inspiration to every American.""  In her own words: Barbara Bush, from political prognostication to 'rhymes with rich'  Her nickname, ""the Silver Fox,"" hinted at both her grandmotherly image but also her behind-the-scenes power as an enforcer of family discipline.  “It’s cliché, but not an exaggeration, to say Barbara Bush was the bulwark and foundation for the whole family,"" said Jeffrey Engel, a presidential historian at Southern Methodist University. ""She was the emotional core and the moral core. The family centered around her. The family may have worked through the achievements of the two President Bushes, but in a real sense it was built around her.""  She was 63 years old when her husband became president — the second-oldest first lady in history.  In recent years, her health deteriorated along with her husband's. Both were hospitalized simultaneously – Mrs. Bush with ""fatigue and coughing"" – in the days leading up to President Trump's inauguration last year and were unable to attend.  Just this month, the former first lady wrote about her husband in a note for the spring edition of Smith College's alumnae magazine.  ""I am still old and still in love with the man I married 72 years ago,"" she wrote in the life updates section for the magazine.  A love story: Barbara Bush was 'still in love with the man I married 72 years ago'  Bush also revealed her secret for a long life: medical attention.  ""I have had great medical care and more operations than you would believe,"" she told the magazine. ""I'm not sure God will recognize me; I have so many new body parts!""  She continued: ""Also, George Bush has given me the world. He is the best — thoughtful and loving.""  The couple met at a Christmas dance in 1941, when Barbara Pierce was 16 and George Bush was 17. They got engaged right before he left to fight in World War II as a Navy pilot. After he returned on leave, she dropped out of Smith College, and the two married in January 1945.  Smith College awarded Barbara Bush with an honorary degree in 1989.  More: Barbara Bush dies: President Trump and wife Melania praise former first lady  More: George W.

"Well, maybe I’m not into Bethenny this week, but I’m obviously into hard boiled eggs! Just make sure they don’t touch my two-egg scramble. I seem crazy, no? Clearly I’m not having a good week. Adam, of three years, announces he went on a date, and that takes me by surprise. But it’s not as surprising as the passive-aggressive digs my friend continues to make about me. I see you…  Bethenny can invite whomever the hell she wants to Puerto Rico, but could it be that I didn’t express any interest in going because she didn’t express any interest in having me go? I didn’t know she and Dorinda were going until they were already there. While she talks smack about me on the show, I’m saying how proud I am of her. Wow…at this point, I'm just sitting back with popcorn like the rest of you, watching this TV character (who I thought was a good friend) continue to take cheap shots. It’s strange that she would say I have no interest in what is going on in Puerto Rico. I was writing checks. I’d asked her many times how things were going. A good friend of mine works with Michael Capponi, and I connected her and Bethenny.  On the other hand, I really don’t give a damn, because my actions speak for themselves. I won’t bore you here recounting the endless places I’ve been to or the stories I’ve brought back exposing neglect, destruction, and people’s sufferings. I did a story once on the landmine crisis, and the head of the campaign went on to win a Noble Peace prize. I’m not bragging — it wasn’t my prize — but I brought attention to a horrible atrocity, and a good thing happened as a result. It may not be private planes, cargo ships, and cash cards, but it’s something.  I am socially aware and politically active. Even when it is uncomfortable, as you saw last season, when I was part of a large “get out the vote” campaign for Hillary Clinton. I know, I know — I was wrong. Trump won. Sure, it didn’t end as I would have liked (understatement), but I remain committed to the idea that good government will bring about good change. I am also grateful to private citizens like Bethenny who step up to fill in the gaping holes. I just don’t understand why she’s fully committed this season to talking about me as though I’m a Miss America contestant who banged her prom date. Haahaahaaa.  Maybe we’ll find out next week. Pass the popcorn!"

"Jennifer Garner confronted Ben Affleck‘s girlfriend Lindsay Shookus in person after she found out about their affair in 2015, sources tell PEOPLE.  Garner was on a work trip to New York City when she approached Shookus about the fling. “Lindsay refused to back down or quit the affair,” says a source.    Responds a source close to Shookus: “Jennifer and Lindsay do not have any relationship.”  Multiple sources have told PEOPLE that Affleck and Shookus started having an affair in 2013, two years before the actor and Garner announced their separation. Shookus was also still with her husband Kevin Miller, then a fellow SNL producer. The two split in 2014.  However, other sources close to Affleck and Shookus maintain that the two were just friends and didn’t date before their respective separations.  Sources also say Garner spoke to Shookus’ ex about the affair. After appearing on an episode of Late Night with Seth Meyers, where Miller is now a supervising producer, Garner sought him out for a conversation.  The first source says she showed him text messages between Affleck and Shookus, adding, “she had proof.” (Miller and Shookus were already split at the time.)  Affleck and Shookus have been spending time together in L.A. since going public with their relationship last week.  For much more on Affleck and Shookus, pick up this week’s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.  RELATED VIDEO: Ben Affleck Reportedly Dating SNL Producer Lindsay Shookus  Affleck and Garner announced their separation in 2015 after over a decade of marriage and filed for divorce this past April. They have continued to closely co-parent their three children — Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5.  “Ben and Jen continue to be dedicated to their family and kids,” says a source who knows Affleck and Garner. “They have been separated for two years now and have never strayed from that dedication. They do it better than anyone.”  Shookus married Kevin Miller in 2010 and the two share a daughter. “They’re both really good friends still,” says a source close to the situation. “They’re both good, devoted parents. Lindsay and Kevin’s marriage didn’t end over infidelity. There were issues they couldn’t resolve and they realized they were better as friends than together.”  Garner is handling her ex’s public relationship fine, sources have said. “Nothing is new for her here,” says one insider. “She’s in mama-bear mode.”"

"Explosive US claims reveal that the 42 year old actress is getting serious with the mystery British millionaire she was linked to last year.    ‘There’s a millionaire British philanthropist who she’s been quietly seeing for over a year now,” a friend of Ange’s spilled to Life & Style.    “Gradually, their romance blossomed into real love.”    And they’re wasting no time taking their relationship to the next level, with the publication reporting that Ange is set to say ‘I do’ to husband number four in London later this year.    So it comes as no surprise that the Maleficent star is pushing to finalise her divorce to Brad and moving their six kids – Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine – to the U.K in time for the wedding.      Life & Style  “She’s decided to marry her wealthy beau as soon as the ink is dry on the divorce from Brad.    “In fact, Angie’s so in love that she was the one to propose.”    The British ceremony fits in perfectly with the busy actresses work schedule.    Maleficent 2 is set to start filming in London from April to August, and then Ange will be fulfilling her duties as a visiting professor at the London School of Economics.    And the kids couldn’t be happier to see their mum walk down the aisle again.    While Ange is no stranger to weddings – she was married to Brit actor Jonny Lee Miller from 1995 – 1997, Hollywood bad boy Billy Bob Thornton for two years in the early 2000’s, before tying the know with Brad in 2014 – this time she’s convinced she’s found ‘The One’.    “She’s described her beau to friends as handsome, distinguished, bold, witty and one of the kindest souls she’s ever met,” continues the source.    “It’s the most unexpected relationship of Angelina’s life, but she thinks he’s the one person who was truly meant for her.”"
"Abby Lee Miller.  Almost a year after pleading guilty to bankruptcy fraud, Dance Moms’ Abby Lee Miller was sentenced Tuesday to a year and a day in prison by a federal judge in Pittsburgh, according to Deadline. She’ll also have to pay a fine of $40,000, along with an additional $120,000 for a currency-reporting violation she was investigated for last summer. Miller filed for bankruptcy in 2010, and was first indicted in 2015 on 20 charges of bankruptcy fraud, concealment of bankruptcy assets, and false bankruptcy declarations. Her legal woes came to a head after federal agencies found evidence that she tried to hide $775,000 in income from Dance Moms, the spinoff Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition, and other Dance Moms–related appearances and merchandise.  In Tuesday’s hearing, character witnesses said Miller isn’t anything like the combative and demanding dance instructor she was portrayed as on the Lifetime show. Afterward, Miller took the stand to defend herself, saying, “Dance Moms became a hit and I became the laughingstock of reality TV.” Miller will likely serve nine months in a facility close to Los Angeles, and have an additional two years of supervised release. Miller’s charges carried up to $5 million in fines and possibly five years in jail, but the Feds initially pushed for a two-and-half-year prison sentence. Miller has 45 days to report to prison."
"It’s become difficult to listen to that hard-charging “Pirates of the Caribbean” theme without hearing Michael Bolton strain-crooning about Captain Jack Sparrow (“the jester of Tartuga!”) for the Lonely Island guys in that memorable “SNL” digital short. Then again, the “Pirates” franchise itself has always seemed like an unlikely mash-up of outlaw posture and pop silliness, eschewing any real sense of seagoing adventure for the more readily achievable goals of brand management and CGI swash and buckle.  The good news, though, is that the fifth entry, “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,” is the most divertingly enjoyable since the first. A professionally crafted brew of action, slapstick and supernatural mumbo-jumbo, it’s less likely to spur timepiece glances than did the last few bloated installments.  You can’t escape the sense that the whole thing, newly steered by the Norwegian directing team of Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg (Oscar nominees for 2012’s “Kon-Tiki”), is a cheeky corrective. Though not as resolutely tipped toward weirdness as Gore Verbinski’s sequels were, it’s neither as overstuffed with the nonsense that sunk “Dead Man’s Chest” and “At World’s End.” It’s also not as zipless and personality-free as the last one, the Rob Marshall-helmed “On Stranger Tides,” which couldn’t justify its existence, stumbling around as much as the series’ anti-hero, Captain Jack.  Watch Video: Keira Knightley Returns in New 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' Trailer  And speaking of Johnny Depp’s scoundrel of self-preservation, his tipsy-turvy antics may no longer be the freshly perfumed brine that subversively pickled what we all assumed was a craven theme-park movie (“The Curse of the Black Pearl”), turning it into a surprise hit. But with the popcorn ethos that animates “Dead Men Tell No Tales,” he’s at least treated like a reliably wiggly wind-up toy again, good for batting about, arranging into crazy positions, and countless batted-eyes double takes mixed with sloshy, cynical one-liners.  When Jack opines on “the unscratchable itch” to his young sailor companion Henry (Brenton Thwaites, “Gods of Egypt”), newly smitten by a beautiful astronomer named Carina (a plucky Kaya Scodelario, “The Maze Runner”), Henry knowingly agrees: love, right? Jack, confused, corrects him: “Scabies.” This isn’t searing wit, obviously, but coming amidst a thrillingly crazy ghost-shark attack and a beach siege by rotting pirates, it’s all just off-kilter enough to feel like a disreputably fun carnival ride.  Also Read: Why 'Pirates of the Caribbean 5' Could Break $1 Billion Despite Flat US Debut  The plot, such as it is in the screenplay by Jeff Nathanson (who wrote the story with franchise stalwart Terry Rossio), follows the pattern of the others: intersecting quests that allow for narrow escapes, odd alliances, and parental reunions. Henry wants to lift the curse on his father Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, back briefly), trapped at the bottom of the ocean in the Flying Dutchman, by finding the all-powerful Trident of Poseidon.  Carina, deemed a witch due to her intelligence, says she can find the Trident using “the map no man can read,” a reference to the use of stars to guide ships. They team with Jack, smarting from having lost the trust of his crew after a foiled bank robbery (an impressive opening action sequence in which a bank building is hauled through St. Martin).  Jack’s reasons for locating the Trident are personal, however: he’s become the target of a ghost captain named Salazar (a digitally decayed Javier Bardem), recently unleashed from the Devil’s Triangle and hellbent on securing revenge on the then-newbie buccaneer who vanquished him. Salazar’s murderous rampage against pirates — his risen, rotted ship forming jaws that chomp other vessels — even spurs the return of Geoffrey Rush’s peg-legged scalawag Barbossa to help defend against this newest threat.  READ MORE See Johnny Depp's latest POWER MOVE. PowerRank: 432  The appeal of any “Pirates” movie is in the aggregate gleam of its many working parts, and this time around, thanks to the energetic direction of Rønning and Sandberg, the shine feels freshly buffed. There’s a dual guillotine/hanging rescue that’s as humorously staged as any in the series’ history; it calls to mind the inventive dash of silent comedy. The elaborate location trappings (ships at sea, island shores, bustling cities) veer between baroquely beautiful and picturesquely lush thanks to Paul Cameron’s colorful cinematography, and unlike the relentlessly dreary night in “On Stranger Tides,” it’s all mostly daytime-set this time around.  The regular houseguests — from Depp and Rush to utility pirate players like Stephen Graham — look game again, while a newcomer like Bardem seems hungry to make his mark and scare the bejesus out of any kids in tow. (Between the sword deaths and the Oscar-winner’s terrifying countenance, this is most decidedly a hard PG-13, parents.) We even get a suitable rock-world replacement for Keith Richards this time around: a delightfully funny Paul McCartney as Jack’s cheerily philosophical, imprisoned pirate uncle.  If you have “Pirates” PTSD, though, discovering the Trident is likely to give you endless-climax hives, and “Dead Men” doesn’t disappoint, devolving into the usual over-the-top CGI operatics. (For starters, the ocean parts.) Afterward, a human-sized surprise is revealed, and it’s easily guessable who’s going to show up, considering Henry’s lineage.

Kidneys play a critical role in the body—acting as the body's filtering system, removing wastes, and controlling blood pressure--and once they fail dialysis or a kidney transplant are needed just to stay alive.NKF CEO, Kevin Longino, said, “Kidney disease has been part of my own life for as long as I can remember, affecting three generations of my family. I am alive today because of the kidney transplant I received 13 years ago from an anonymous deceased donor—and there isn’t a day that goes by when I do not give thanks to the family who, despite their tragic loss, allowed me to live.I would like to extend my heartfelt support to Selena as she continues her journey towards kidney health. Finding a match is not easy; and I am sure she feels immensely blessed and grateful to her dear friend, Francia Raisa for the gift of life. To all of us, she is nothing short of a hero.”There are currently more than 100,000 people on the kidney transplant wait list –and the average wait time is long, three to five years or longer. But many kidney patients never get a transplant because they are afraid to ask their family members and friends for help. National Kidney Foundation can help people start the conversation through a special free program called The Big Ask: The Big Give . Our goal is to get as many people off the waiting list as possible and help all of them find a second chance at life.Ms. Gomez’s brave public acknowledgement of the battle she’s been privately facing, and the gift of life she received, will give strength to others to do the same."
"Now, after years of unsubstantiated rumors about Louis C.K. masturbating in front of associates, women are coming forward to describe what they experienced. Even amid the current burst of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men, the stories about Louis C.K. stand out because he has so few equals in comedy. In the years since the incidents the women describe, he has sold out Madison Square Garden eight times, created an Emmy-winning TV series, and accumulated the clout of a tastemaker and auteur, with the help of a manager who represents some of the biggest names in comedy. And Louis C.K. built a reputation as the unlikely conscience of the comedy scene, by making audiences laugh about hypocrisy — especially male hypocrisy.  [ Read Louis C.K.’s statement: “These stories are true” ]  After being contacted for an interview this week about the on-the-record accusations of sexual misconduct — encounters that took place over a decade ago — Louis C.K.’s publicist, Lewis Kay, said the comedian would not respond. “Louis is not going to answer any questions,” Mr. Kay wrote in an email Tuesday night.  Neither Louis C.K. nor Mr. Kay replied to follow-up emails in which the accusations were laid out in detail, or to voice messages or texts. On Thursday, the premiere of Louis C.K.’s new movie “I Love You, Daddy,” was abruptly canceled, and he also canceled an appearance on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”  The stories told by the women raise sharp questions about the anecdotes that Louis C.K. tells in his own comedy. He rose to fame in part by appearing to be candid about his flaws and sexual hang-ups, discussing and miming masturbation extensively in his act — an exaggerated riff that some of the women feel may have served as a cover for real misconduct. He has all but invited comparison between his private life and his onscreen work, too: In “I Love You, Daddy,” which is scheduled to be released next week, a character pretends to masturbate at length in front of other people, and other characters appear to dismiss rumors of sexual predation.  At the same time, Louis C.K. has also boosted the careers of women, and is sometimes viewed as a feminist by fans and critics. But Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov said that when they told others about the incident in the Colorado hotel room, they heard that Louis C.K.’s manager was upset that they were talking about it openly. The women feared career repercussions. Louis C.K.’s manager, Dave Becky, was adamant in an email that he “never threatened anyone.”"
"Barack Obama has announced plans to become secretary general of the United Nations, allowing him to advance his globalist agenda on the world’s stage.According to Al-Jarida, Obama has no intention to step away from the spotlight, much to the dismay of other world leaders such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly is planning payback for President Obama’s dismissing Mr. Netanyahu’s objections to the Iran nuclear deal last year. Mr. Netanyahu is said to be rallying moderate Arabs to thwart Mr. Obama’s bid to become the Secretary-General of the United Nations after he leaves the White House next year.Mr. Obama has already discussed the issue with Republican, Democratic and Jewish officials in the United States, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida.Mr. Netanyahu recently is said to have gotten wind of Obama’s plans which he calls the Obama Project. “Wasn’t eight years of having Obama in office enough?” Mr. Netanyahu is quoted in the Kuwaiti daily as telling associates. “Eight years during which he ignored Israel? And now he wants to be in a position that is liable to cause us hardships in the international arena.”Townhall.com reports: Further gripes Israel has with President Obama include the U.S. “moving closer to the Muslim Brotherhood, toppling the regime of Hosni Mubarak, and attempts to ally itself with political Islam,” the paper quotes a Netanyahu aide as saying.U.N.

"Selena On Going To Rehab For Psychiatric Treatment: “You have no idea how incredible it felt to just be with six girls, real people who couldn’t give two s**ts about who I was, who were fighting for their lives. It was one of the hardest things I’ve done, but it was the best thing I’ve done.”  Selena On Dialectical Behavior Therapy: “DBT has completely changed my life. I wish more people would talk about therapy. We girls, we’re taught to be almost too resilient, to be strong and sexy and cool and laid-back, the girl who’s down. We also need to feel allowed to fall apart.”  Selena On Interacting With Fans In Public: “Somebody I used to hang out with would always get very frustrated with me. But I have a hard time saying no to children.”  Selena On Moving Beyond Disney: “I worked with Disney for four years. It’s a very controlled machine. They know what they represent, and there was, 100 percent, a way to go about things… For a guy there’s a way to rebel that can work for you. But for a woman, that can backfire. It’s hard not to be a cliché, the child star gone wrong. I did respect my fans and what I had, but I was also figuring out what I was passionate about and how far I was willing to go.”  Selena On Life Changing In The Spotlight: I’m a late bloomer. I grew up around adults, but in terms of getting out, having friends. At times I really didn’t know anything but my job… My mom gave up her whole life for me. Where we’re from, you don’t really leave. So when I started gaining all this success, there was a guilt that came with it. I thought, Do I deserve this?”  Selena On Not Feeling Career Pressure Right Now: “For a change,” she says, “it feels like I don’t have to be holding my breath and waiting for somebody to judge a piece of work that I’m doing. I’m not eager to chase a moment. I don’t think there’s a moment for me to chase.”  Selena On Limiting Her Network, Privately And Publicly: “I think seventeen people have my phone number right now. Maybe two are famous… As soon as I became the most followed person on Instagram, I sort of freaked out. It had become so consuming to me. It’s what I woke up to and went to sleep to. I was an addict, and it felt like I was seeing things I didn’t want to see, like it was putting things in my head that I didn’t want to care about. I always end up feeling like shit when I look at Instagram. Which is why I’m kind of under the radar, ghosting it a bit… Look, I love what I do, and I’m aware of how lucky I am, but, how can I say this without sounding weird? I just really can’t wait for people to forget about me.”  The article notes Gomez declined to discuss her relationship with The Weeknd, with the writer saying, “She tells me that everything she has said about her relationships in the past has come back to bite her, and that she will never do it again.” The full issue of Vogue will hit newsstands on March 28."
"Jennifer Aniston has confessed she still loves Brad Pitt and was 'shocked' and 'hurt' to see pictures of him with new love Angelina Jolie.  ""Am I lonely? Yes,"" she told Vanity Fair magazine. ""Am I upset? Yes. Am I confused? Yes. Do I have my days when I've thrown a little pity party for myself? Absolutely. But I'm also doing really well.""  The 36-year-old talks openly about her pain over the split for the first time and shed tears when confronted with the possibility that Pitt and his Mr and Mrs Smith co-star might start their own family.  ""I'd be a robot if I said I didn't feel moments of anger, of hurt, of embarrassment,"" she said.  Aniston freely admits that when pictures surfaced of the couple on holiday together with Jolie's young son, Maddox, it was ""not one of the highlights"" of her year.  But she added: ""You joke and say, 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger'.""  It only got worse when the two posed as man and wife for a magazine spread, a decision Aniston described as 'odd timing'.  ""There's a sensitivity chip that's missing (from Pitt),"" she said. ""But it's not my life. He makes his choices. He can do - whatever. We're (soon to be) divorced and you can see why.""  'Lonely and confused'  Although the estranged pair no longer talk, Aniston said she had chosen to believe Pitt, 41, when he said he did not sleep with Jolie before their marriage fell apart in January.  ""I just don't know what happened,"" she said. ""There's a lot I don't understand, a lot I don't know, and probably never will know, really.  ""I choose to believe my husband. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised by anything, but I would much rather choose to believe him.""  Her best friend and Friends co-star, Courteney Cox, joined in to reveal that although there was no affair, ""there was a connection"" between Jolie and Pitt, ""and he was honest about that with Jen.""  Aniston said the rumours that the couple had split because she did not want children had made her fume.  ""I've never in my life said I didn't want to have children,"" she raged. ""I did, and I do, and I will!""  Despite her pain, Aniston cannot switch off her feelings.  ""I love Brad,"" she told the September edition of the magazine. ""I will love him for the rest of my life. I really do hope that someday we can be friends again."""

"(CNN) The biggest misconception surrounding the special counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election is that it will likely end in some sort of legal proceeding involving President Donald Trump. It won't -- for a bunch of reasons, the most important of which is that Robert Mueller, who is running the investigation, doesn't seem to believe a sitting President can be indicted.  The much more likely outcome is that Mueller releases the findings from his investigation sometime this fall — and lets the chips, as they relate to Trump, fall where they may. Which means — and this is what Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have understood for months — that, ultimately, this isn't a legal fight, it's a public relations one.  Giuliani tipped his hand on that strategy Monday in an interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota. ""I'll be here with my version of the report and they'll have their version of the report and the American people, in that sense, are going to decide it,"" Giuliani said of the Mueller investigation.  ""My version"" vs. ""their version."" What that construct from Giuliani misses, of course, is that one of the ""versions"" will be the result of a Justice Department-commissioned investigation led by the former head of the FBI that has already spanned more than a year. The other ""version"" will be Giuliani's cable TV appearances and President Trump's tweets.  That is, on its face, an apples-and-oranges comparison. But remember what Giuliani and Trump know: The debate over whether and how much Trump did wrong (if anything) is almost certain to be decided in the court of public opinion, not an actual court. And in the court of public opinion -- particularly given the fealty that rank-and-file Republicans have shown (and continue to show) to Trump, the comparison is far more favorable to Trump's side."
"What happens when a prince interviews a president? Well, if this teaser of Britain’s Prince Harry interviewing former US president Barack Obama is anything to go by, the answer is a lot of fun.  On Prince Harry’s request, Barack Obama agreed to star in a guest edition of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Kensington Palace shared the trailer on Sunday,where Harry can be seen joking with Obama.  In the preview, Obama asks Harry if he has to speak quickly, since he is a slow speaker. “Do I need a British accent?” jokes Obama.  In turn, Harry tells the former president that if he takes long pauses between answers, he will get “the face”.  “Let me see the face”, asks Obama, leading Prince Harry to pull an exaggerated mock-grimace. “I don’t want to see that face,” the former president says.  Here is a sneak preview of when @BarackObama met Prince Harry for the interview. Listen to the full interview on 27th December on @BBCr4today. pic.twitter.com/p5I1dUdyhx — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) December 17, 2017  The trailer also shows Prince Harry saying that while Obama is excited, he is feeling nervous. “I’ll interview you if you want,” says Obama. “Let’s keep it this way, I’d much prefer that,” replies Harry.  Harry and Obama are known for their rapport and their very public exchanges of sassy banter. Who can forget the British royal’s Twitter ‘war’ with the Obamas while promoting the 2015 Invictus Games, which lead to Harry’s by-now-famous ‘mic drop’ moment? Not even the Queen.  Invictus Games is a Paralympic sporting event for injured or sick armed forces personnel, that was found by Prince Harry in 2014.  Harry and Obama hung out at this year’s Invictus Games in Toronto in September, joking, cheering and taking selfies with fans. Social media gushed over the bromance, spinning memes around it.  The full 40-minute interview will air December 27 on England’s BBC Radio 4 Today.  First Published: Dec 18, 2017 12:23 IST"

The Oscar-winning actress and Goop CEO enlisted Nashville-based organization service The Home Edit to help her get her Hamptons home in order.  thehomeedit/Instagram/NBC  They were the ones who did the now-famous pantry, and recently shared snaps of the gorgeous playroom.  “We just spent the most INCREDIBLE few days at @gwynethpaltrow's Hamptons house,” they posted on Instagram. “Our favorite project from the trip (and of all time) was the playroom.”  The room features two walls of bookshelves with activities (like board games and a globe) on the left and leisure (like books and plush animals) on the right. To organize it even more, they created zones for reading, games, art, crafts and science.  “We categorized books and stuffed animals by color so that everything is easy to find (not to mention pretty to look at),” they added. The result is a beautiful crisp white room with strategically placed pops of color. We just wonder how long the meticulous organization will actually last once a kid gets into it.  Paltrow’s children, Apple and Moses, are 13 and 11 respectively, so perhaps they’ll be a little more tidy than, say, a toddler might be.  Feeling inspired to make your own playroom this gorgeous?

"Justin Bieber Got Engaged.. Selena Gomez is upset  Selena Gomez was “surprised” to hear about Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin‘s engagement.  Over the weekend, the 24-year-old “Baby” singer proposed to the 21-year-old model while on vacation in the Bahamas. Shortly after news of her ex’s engagement broke on Sunday, Gomez was spotted smiling on a boat with her pals in New York City.  “Selena was surprised an engagement happened this quickly but not surprised Justin would do something like this knowing who he is. At the end of the day though she doesn’t really care,” one source tells us. “Selena is totally over him. She had tried again to make it work that last time and it didn’t work out.”  Now let’s talk about Justin Bieber and Selena-  Justin Bieber and Selena were a very good friend and were coming to hear that Justin Bieber would also engage with Selena but it did not happen.  “Selena is definitely on a different path right now and in a much better place since Justin is out of the picture. Mentally, she is done with him,” the insider continues. “She isn’t focused on dating as much as she’s just really focusing on herself. She’s happy right now just spending time with her girlfriends and going to church.”  When Bieber and Gomez parted ways in March 2018, a source told that Gomez was ready to move on, saying, “Selena realized even though he’s made some positive improvements, they just aren’t a perfect match right now.” However, this reportedly wasn’t the case for Bieber, with a source claiming to People, “He thinks and talks about Selena all the time — the chapter with her is definitely not finished… They weren’t getting along and decided to take a break.”  However, it seems as though Bieber is finally moving on from Gomez.

"Slow Hands is a song recorded by Irish singer and songwriter Niall Horan, released as a single on 4 May 2017 by Capitol Records.[2] The song was written by Horan, Alexander Izquierdo, John Ryan, Julian Bunetta, Ruth Anne Cunningham and Tobias Jesso Jr., while the production was handled by Bunetta.[3] It was serviced to US contemporary hit radio on 9 May 2017[4] as the second single from Horan's debut solo album Flicker (2017).  ""Slow Hands"" peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart and number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Horan's highest-charting single in those countries.  Background and composition [ edit ]  Prior to its release, Horan discussed the song in an interview with Mikey Piff on Sirius XM. The singer said that after listening to some of the material he had recorded for his debut album, he wanted to add ""a bit more grit, funk and heavier bass."" At the time he was listening to late 1970s and early 1980s music. ""When Don Henley went solo in the early eighties, he just kinda had this funky kind of feel to it – heavy bass, heavy guitar – so I just thought, 'Let's give this a crack,'"" Horan said of making the track. ""I wanted it to be a little bit cheeky with the lyric."" About the concept, he explained it is set in a bar and the song's theme changes up stereotypical roles. ""The first line is...'we should take this back to my place' – and usually that's what the guy would say, but we flipped it that the girl would say that, and that's what she said right to my face.""[5][6]  ""Slow Hands"" is a bass-heavy funk-pop song, with Horan singing in a lower register.[5][7] A Billboard writer described it as an ""R&B-inflected rock tune.""[8]  Critical reception [ edit ]  In Billboard, Taylor Weatherby noted ""Slow Hands"" focuses on a ""funkier guitar vibe"", compared to Horan's previous single ""This Town."" She also opined ""the subtly-sexy song"" shows an ""edgier side of Niall.""[9] Colin Stutz from the publication, added, ""The combination of a thumping beat and Horan's raspy vocals makes the song hardly even sound like the same guy who sang [""This Town""]. But what ""Slow Hands"" shows is that Horan definitely won't just be sticking to the sweet singer-songwriter sound on his solo debut.""[6] Rolling Stone's Althea Legaspi also noted Horan ""goes for a more muted sound. Above a stomp-and-clap beat and muted guitar, Horan allows his lower register to showcase his more seductive side on the track.""[5]  In The Irish Times, Jennifer Gannon wrote that ""it’s no radical departure, Niall hasn’t decided to go Gaga but it’s a step in a more Sheeran-style, crowd-pleasing direction. A gentle, foot-stomper about a lady with a magic touch, a lady who knows what she wants, she wants to get her hands all over Niall's ""dirty laundry"" and not in a bringing your washing home on a Sunday way. This isn’t Timberlake’s Sexy Back, it’s Horan’s Sweaty Back.""[10]  Billboard's critics' list placed it second on ""Every One Direction Solo Single, Ranked"" in May 2017, stating that the ""secret"" highlight ""[is] the way Niall's vocal on the first verse is ever so discretely chopped on the recording to a clipped staccato, a mysterious move that forces the singer into a less-is-more delivery that ends up being much more indeed.""[11]  Chart performance [ edit ]  ""Slow Hands"" charted within the top 10 in the charts of Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The single became his second top 20 entry as a solo artist on the US Billboard Hot 100, reaching number 11 and surpassing his preceding single ""This Town"", which reached number 20. On 15 September 2017, the single was certified Platinum for combined sales and streaming equivalent units of over a million units in the United States. On the chart dated 7 October 2017, the single reached number one on the Mainstream Top 40 chart.[12] As of December 2017, it has sold one million copies in the US.[13]  Live performances [ edit ]  Horan has performed ""Slow Hands"" on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.[14][15] On 29 May 2017, the singer performed ""Slow Hands"", ""This Town"" and premiered the track ""On the Loose"" on The Today Show.[16] On 4 June 2017, Horan performed the song during the One Love Manchester benefit concert for the victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.[17] On 5 June he performed on BBC One's The One Show.[18] The singer also performed ""Slow Hands"" at the Capital FM's Summertime Ball 2017.[19]  On 22 June 2018, Horan performed the song with American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, at the first London show of her Reputation Stadium Tour at Wembley Stadium, as a surprise guest.

"Actor tells Stephen Colbert on The Late Show he ‘couldn’t be happier’ to resume 007 role despite previous comments  He once said he would rather take his own life than reprise his role as 007. But Daniel Craig may now be regretting his words, as he has confirmed he will, for one final time, play James Bond.  Speaking on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on US TV on Tuesday night, the actor finally put an end to the long-running saga of will he/won’t he play the character for a fifth time.  “I have been quite cagey about it. I have been doing interviews all day and people have been asking me and I think I’ve been rather coy. But kind of felt like if I was going to speak the truth I should speak truth to you.”  Asked by Colbert directly whether he could deliver some “good news” about returning as Bond, Craig finally replied: “Yes.”  He revealed he had known for a “couple of months”, adding: “We’ve been discussing it, we’ve just been trying to figure things out. I always wanted to, I needed a break.”  However, he was keen to reiterate it would indeed be his last outing as the lothario spy. “I think this is it. I just want to go out on a high note and I can’t wait,” he said.  It is not surprising news, as his return was first reported in July. However, Craig’s renewed enthusiasm for the role marks a change of mind after comments he made in 2015, following the release of Spectre.  Edan Clay (@EdanClay) Thank f*cking GAWD! Daniel Craig is coming back as BOND!  Hurry the f*ck up!!! pic.twitter.com/tx8MqPhpnR  The film garnered rave reviews but Craig, clearly frustrated with the promotional commitments that accompanied playing Bond, said he would rather “slit my wrists” than reprise the role.  “I’m over it at the moment. We’re done. All I want to do is move on,” he said, adding: “If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.”  But explaining his heated comments, Craig told Colbert that they had been made in the moment, two days after Spectre had finished shooting when he was exhausted. “Instead of saying something with style and grace, I said something really stupid,” he said.  It is the source of much speculation of how much the film studios will have promised Craig to tempt him back. He was rumoured to have been paid $65m (£48.66m) for Spectre, and in 2016 it was reported he had been offered $150m to shoot two more Bond films, almost back to back.  Say never again: why Daniel Craig should quit while he's ahead as Bond Read more  Neither – should they both happen – will be directed by Sam Mendes, who, despite the critical and commercial success of Spectre and its predecessor, Skyfall, has ruled himself out of returning. Directors rumoured to be in the running include Christopher Nolan.  Thanks to Craig’s reticence to return to the franchise, speculation over who could replace him has raged for two years, with figures such as Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Tom Hiddleston and Aidan Turner and even Gillian Anderson all put forward as suggestions. Elba said he was already weary of the attention that the speculation had attracted. “I’m probably the most famous Bond actor in the world, and I’ve not even played the role,” he said in 2015. “Enough is enough. I can’t talk about it any more.”  Craig succeeded Pierce Brosnan as Bond and made his debut in Casino Royale in 2006. While initially seen as a divisive choice, he was soon praised for his darker, more brooding take on the martini-sipping spy, which proved a massive hit at the box office, with the Observer film critic Mark Kermode describing him as the “best screen Bond to date”.  Skyfall was one of the highest grossing films of all time when it was released in 2012, and was the first Bond film to gross over $1bn at the box office. 2015’s Spectre, which was described by the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw as “terrifically exciting, spectacular, almost operatically delirious 007 adventure” cost $245m to make – the most expensive Bond film to date – but was also box office gold, taking in $880m worldwide.  Craig has not been solely negative about the impact playing Bond has had on his life, and said he did not worry about being typecast because the role had “changed my working life in an incredible way”.  dani ✨ (@boldlygaying) DANIEL CRAIG CONFIRMED HES BACK AS BOND FOR 2 MORE MOVIES!!!! pic.twitter.com/IbxevPJLZd  He added: “There are more opportunities. I could do many, many things. But it takes an awful amount of time. If anything, the restriction is that it is incredibly time-consuming. That’s the restriction.”  The producers are also rumoured to be determined to bring back Adele to record the theme tune, after her song written for Skyfall became the first 007 theme to win a Grammy and a Golden Globe award.  The next Bond film, the 25th in the series, is scheduled for release in November 2019."
"As has become a tradition for Ryan Murphy programming, the day has finally come — FX promotional materials aside — that we can gaze upon the actors he’s hired to portray historical figures for The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. Since the world can only handle so much suspense in being exposed to Penélope Cruz’s bleach-blonde Donatella, we put together side-by-side comparisons of Versace’s actors and their real-life counterparts to give you a taste of what’s to come, as well as some historical information to appraise you on who’s who. Knowledge is power, readers!  Darren Criss as Andrew Cunanan  Photo: FX Networks/Getty  Cunanan, a gay gigolo with a genius-level IQ who lived his formative years in California, is known to have murdered at least five people throughout his 1997 killing spree, which began with his murder of an acquaintance in Minneapolis. Cunanan is believed to have suffered from antisocial personality disorder, which in turn made him “crave the limelight and aspire to the top, whether through charm or falsehood,” according to Vanity Fair’s Maureen Orth. Eight days after killing Versace, he committed suicide on a houseboat in Miami.  Edgar Ramírez as Gianni Versace  Photo: FX Networks/Getty  At the time of his death, the Versace empire had amassed a reputation as one of the most innovative and popular fashion houses in the world, during which time Gianni also absorbed a devoted celebrity clientele. (“A good designer must cultivate himself. Read, absorb everything,” he once told Charlie Rose in an interview. “To be superficial, you have to be profound.”) He was also open about his sexuality, becoming one of the first prominent celebrities to reveal he was gay in the ’80s. He was 50 years old when murdered by Cunanan.  Penélope Cruz as Donatella Versace  Photo: FX Networks/Getty  While Donatella is now known as the spunky HBIC and artistic director of Versace, things were different back in 1997. At the time of her brother’s murder, she was running her own diffusion label of the brand, Versus Versace, which was created specifically for her by Gianni. Upon his death — which she did not witness — Donatella was given full creative control of the Versace brand, eventually guiding it through numerous iconic and memorable collections throughout her continuing tenure. She’s rarely spoken about Gianni, though she spoke to the Guardian about him on the 20th anniversary of his death. “When my brother was murdered, I had the eyes of the whole world on me and 99 percent of them thought I wasn’t going to make it,” she said in part. “And maybe I thought the same, at first. My brother was the king, and my whole world had crashed around me.” In the days following his murder, Donatella and most of the Versace family retreated to a private Caribbean resort due to safety concerns.  Ricky Martin as Antonio D’Amico  Photo: FX Networks/Getty  D’Amico, an Italian model and fashion designer for Versace Sport, was Gianni’s companion for 15 years. He was eating breakfast inside the Miami mansion when the murder occurred, later describing how he fell into a deep depressive state in the subsequent years. “I had never been through a depression and never saw a therapist as I was advised to: why did I need to tell someone else what had happened when I knew I was this way because Gianni’s death had torn me in two?” he recently told the Guardian in a rare interview. “I was in a nightmare, I felt nothing and gave no importance to anything … the house, the money … because it felt false to have expectations of life.” D’Amico has been living a “simple” life in the Italian countryside with his new long-term partner for several years now.  Mike Farrell as Lee Miglin  Photo: Getty Images  Miglin — a real-estate mogul based in Chicago, who rose from a poor background to achieve his success — was the third victim of Cunanan’s murder spree prior to Versace’s murder. The extremely gruesome May 1997 crime scene, which was widely covered at the time by the Chicago Tribune, was described as a murder “that would be considered vicious in any Chicago neighborhood, let alone the city’s most expensive.” The Miglin family has repeatedly denied that Lee, or anyone else in the extended family circle, ever had a personal connection to Cunanan.  Judith Light as Marilyn Miglin  Photo: FX Networks/HSN  A former dancer who built a beauty empire at the Home Shopping Network, Miglin was married to her husband, Lee, for nearly 40 years. She has rarely spoken about her husband in the years since his murder, with her only substantial interview appearing in the Chicago Tribune a year after Lee’s death. “I don’t think you heal — you never close up that gaping wound — but you adjust,” she said at the time. “I lived the life of a fairy princess and I had a prince for 38 years, and then one day my prince went to war and didn’t come back.” Miglin’s products on HSN continue to be wildly popular."

"The concert, part of “The Joshua Tree Tour,” was slated to take place at The Dome at America’s Center. But this morning, the band and the concert promoter “regrettably” released a joint statement saying, “We have been informed by the St. Louis Police Department that they are not in a position to provide the standard protection for our audience as would be expected for an event of this size. We have also been informed that local crowd security personnel would not be at full capacity. In light of this information, we cannot in good conscience risk our fans’ safety by proceeding with tonight’s concert. As much as we regret having to cancel, we feel it is the only acceptable course of action in the current environment.”  Fans are reacting after U2 canceled its St. Louis concert amid protests in the city. On Friday, activists began demonstrating after Jason Stockley, a white police officer, was acquitted of murder in the shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, who is black. While people are protesting both the verdict and police use of deadly force, cops are on the streets monitoring the demonstrations. Consequently, U2 and Live Nation says there is not enough security to hold their Saturday night show as scheduled.  {""position1"": {""artist"": {""bio"": """", ""id"": 970, ""name"": ""U2""}, ""catalog_type"": ""artist"", ""description"": """", ""id"": 970, ""name"": ""U2"", ""related"": [{""bio"": """", ""id"": 1648, ""name"": ""Coldplay""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 26291, ""name"": ""Simple Minds""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 4829, ""name"": ""INXS""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 39703, ""name"": ""The Cranberries""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 6765, ""name"": ""Pearl Jam""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 4688, ""name"": ""The Police""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 32153, ""name"": ""The Cure""}], ""tagged"": false, ""type"": ""catalog""}}  Nothing was said about rescheduling the show, and fans will be able to get refunds. The protests, which are ongoing, have so far led to more than 20 arrests, and 10 police officers were reportedly injured on Friday night, though many, of course, are also demonstrating peacefully. And on Twitter, a number of people are sounding off on the decision to cancel the concert. A user with the handle @DrunkRedbirdFan, for instance, posted, “U2 canceling? They could have used the platform to bring unity and hope to a city and country that needs it. #U2 #STLVerdict.”  @Mina_UK said, “Bono’s a social activist. I hope @U2 comes out to support those in the STL community hurting from the decision. #onelove #carryeachother.” @yrofcreation posted, “U2 concert canceled in #STL tonight. The #STLVerdict just got real for a bunch of white people. #Stockley #resist.” @charlesjaco1 observed, “U2 cancels tonight’s St Louis concert b/c not enough cops to provide proper security. The same cops whose actions sparked the protests.”  @RachWhittBarnes tweeted to the group, “@U2 Since you’re free tonight, I hope you’ll join in the protest at 5pm downtown. I’m sad to miss a show, but this is more important.” @isk9 argued, “People in St. Louis are b**ching because U2 canceled their show tonight? Get over yourselves, a cop got away with murder. Be pissed at that.” Still, others were dealing with logistical issues. @sparks4kids told the band, “We never received an email from Ticketmaster saying show was canceled but did receive an email about which entrance to use. #u2Stlouis.” @atu2comSherry also pointed out, “@Ticketmaster needs to catch up w/U2’s cancellation announcement – it seems tix holders haven’t been directly notified.”  “Feel just awful for all the #u2fam missing out on the gig In StLouis. Especially ones that this was only show. But #u2 had no choice,” commented @thedoorsdf71. @MeganClontz17 shared, “Sorry that this had to happen for those of you planning on going. I was gonna see @HunterHayes in 2014 but he canceled because of Ferguson.” And @theHorizon74 stated, “I understand the decision totally! I’m so sorry for all the fans….but safety first! Be careful.” U2 is pictured above at a Detroit concert earlier this month.  See the tweets below."
"Eagle-eyed fans may have noticed that Ryan Gosling closed out his gig as host for the season 43 premiere of Saturday Night Live wearing a graphic shirt bearing the image of his dog, George. As it turns out, there was quite a sentimental reason before the sartorial statement. Appearing on Ellen yesterday, Gosling confirmed that the beloved canine had recently passed away at the age of seventeen. ""He was a good friend to me,"" Gosling told Ellen Degeneres during the sit-down. ""There was something about George where he always—I think he felt being a dog was beneath him. He would not do tricks. if you wanted him to sit down you would have to convince him that it was in his best interest.""  Fans of the actor will be familiar with just how close the pair were—George even appeared alongside Gosling during an appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon a few years back. Gosling took Friday's stint on Ellen to share some of his other favorite memories of the canine. ""One time we were at an outdoor restaurant and he was sort of sitting on the pavement, looking forlorn down the street,” he shared. “Someone got up to go to the restroom, and I guess he’d had enough, and he got up on their seat and sat down at the table like a gentleman and looked around the table, like, ‘Yeah, that’s right.’”  In brighter Gosling news, his film Bladerunner 2049 , for which he's been on the promo circuit for over the past few weeks, opened in theaters on Friday after much anticipation to generally favorable reviews. The long overdue sequel is set to pull in $36 million in its opening weekend, and is already generating some early Academy Awards buzz—meaning that we can expect plenty more emotional talk show appearances in the coming months.

"In Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot found the role model she'd always wanted to play.  The DC superhero movie star was presented the second ever #SeeHer Award at the Critics' Choice Awards on Thursday, which honors more accurate portrayals of women in film. Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins presented Gadot with the award, who went on to address Time's Up and the current movement of women speaking out with their stories of sexual harassment and called for more women leading films -- and in the director's chair.  ""Throughout my career, I was asked to describe my dream role, and it was clear to me that I wanted to play a strong and independent woman. A real one,"" the Israeli actress shared. ""When I started acting, there were very few female-led movies and even fewer female directors.""  ""In the past weeks and months, we've been witnessing a movement within our industry and society,"" Gadot continued. ""We will band together to make strides, uniting for equality.""  Gadot follows in the footsteps of Viola Davis, who won the first award at last year's show.  Watch the video below for more of what Gadot has said about the Time's Up initiative.

"Ivanka Trump revealed in a new interview that she was caught off guard by the “level of viciousness” that she and her family have faced in Washington, D.C., since her father, Donald Trump, was elected president.  “It is hard and there is a level of viciousness that I was not expecting,” the first daughter, 35, said on Fox News’ Fox & Friends on Monday, June 12. “I was not expecting the intensity of this experience. But this isn’t supposed to be easy. My father, and this administration, expects to be transformative.”  Ivanka continued, “I think some of the distraction and some of the ferocity I was a little blindsided by on a personal level. But for me, I’m trying to keep my head down, not listen to the noise and just work really hard to make a positive impact in the lives of many people.”  The businesswoman was asked how the president, 70, felt after watching former FBI Director James Comey‘s Senate testimony last week. “My father felt very vindicated in all the statements that he has been making and feels incredibly optimistic,” Ivanka said. (Trump abruptly fired Comey in May amid the FBI’s investigation into whether Russia interfered with the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.)  “We are really focused on why the American people elected Donald Trump as their president,” the fashion designer added.  During Monday’s interview, Ivanka also shut down reports that her husband, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, was involved in palace intrigue. “There is a 24-hour news cycle that gets fed by and is encouraged by lots of salacious details,” Ivanka said. “At the end of the day, we are all focused on the work, and that’s very true for Jared. He is somebody who just likes to get things done. So, he doesn’t get involved in all that.”  An Ivanka source recently told Us Weekly that the former model and Kushner, 36, often go toe-to-toe with the commander in chief. “[They] are a big influence on Donald and sometimes he takes other opinions into account and does something they disagree with,” the insider exclusively told Us.

"Talk about a True transformation! Khloé Kardashian says she has lost 33 lbs in the three months since she gave birth to daughter True, her first child, on April 12.  In a post on her official app, the 34-year-old reality star credited a “combination of breastfeeding and being very active” for the impressive weight loss.  Mommy’s Little Love A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on May 26, 2018 at 2:13pm PDT  “After I had True, I didn’t put any pressure on myself to lose the baby weight,” Kardashian wrote. “I just wanted to get back to my regular routine from before I got pregnant, which was working out five to six times a week.”  Then Kardashian got down to specifics: “Here is where I am at currently. True turned 3 months old on July 12. I honestly didn’t give myself a number that I wanted to lose by this time, especially since I wasn’t able to work out for the first six weeks. But, since then, I’ve lost 33 pounds! I’m shocked that I lost that much weight that quickly. I’m chalking this up to the combination of breastfeeding and being very active during and after my pregnancy.”  Shortly after she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson welcomed True, the Good American founder resumed workouts with her trainer, Joel “Coach Joe” Bouraïma, and she recently slammed speculation she was on a “ridiculous” post-baby diet.  And in her latest post, Kardashian emphasized the role of exercise in her life while asserting that not all mothers need to be such gym devotees. “I never compare myself to other women as every woman has their own journey. We also all have different priorities in our day-to-day lives. One of mine is having that one hour where I can be selfish and alone in my place of refuge,” she wrote.  “Staying healthy and active is something that’s very important to me,” she added. “Exercise is something I’ve always used to maintain my sanity and relieve stress. And, now that I have a baby, I still want to keep something that’s my time, my space, something I’m doing for myself.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!"
"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”"
"Kendall Jenner is taking a cue from Jamie Foxx and blaming it on the alcohol.  Ellen DeGeneres grilled Jenner when the reality star appeared on her talk show, asking her about her discreet tattoos. Turns out, she wasn’t exactly clearheaded while deciding to get inked on her inner lip back in July 2016.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Before carefully exposing the hidden tattoo (Jenner took pains not smudge her statement lipstick), the model told DeGeneres, “I was drunk! I was not thinking clearly.”  The host also inquired about the 22-year-old’s choice of phrase: the word “meow.”  “It was literally the first thing that came to my mind,” she explained. “I don’t know, just my drunk thoughts.”  Despite DeGeneres’ hesitation, Jenner noted that the location of her tattoo minimalized the pain. The body art done on her fingers where there’s bone, however, hurt a bit, Jenner said.  The talk show star examined the tattoos on Jenner’s fingers, a heart and a dot, done in white ink to be inconspicuous.  “I just wanted to know what it felt like,” Jenner explained when asked why she would elect to have barely visible artwork done. “All my friends have them. I was like, ‘I just want to know what it feels like.’ “  Kendall Jenner JonBoy Tattoo/Instagram  Unlike many who get tattoos with special significance, the model previously wrote on her website that her inner lip ink was just for fun — despite older sister Kim Kardashian West’s advice to never “put a bumper sticker on a Bentley.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kendall Jenner Opens Up About Her Golden Globes Acne: ‘Never Let That S— Stop You!’  “There’s no real meaning behind it, I just wanted to be able to say that I have a tattoo ‘on my face,’ ” she said. “I have two others also: a broken heart on one hand and a full heart on the other.”  Jenner continued, “I definitely want more and even though I used to say I’d only get one if it meant something to me, now I have even more possibilities!”"
"And it’s beneath the White House and the speakerSo both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the country’s problems. (Republicans: “This President is breaking the law!” Democrats: “They want to impeach the president!”) And what’s particularly jarring is that this isn’t taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill. It’s beneath the White House, and it’s beneath the speaker. And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision. The leaders in both parties aren’t taking their frustrations seriously. Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks.A Tale of Two BillsDespite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming American’s embattled VA hospital system. And what happened was an ACTUAL compromise -- where both sides gave up something to get something. Democrats got increased funding for VA hospitals; Republicans got additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. So that’s on track to become law before Congress departs on its August recess. And a big reason why is that Democrats and Republicans couldn’t afford to look like they were alienating a key constituency -- veterans. And that’s maybe the biggest difference between VA reform (which looks like it will become law) and the emergency relief at the border (which doesn’t). In the case of the border, there just isn’t a major constituency that puts fear into BOTH parties.House GOP “cautiously optimistic” about ability to get 218 votes for border billAs for the House GOP’s $659 million border bill, NBC’s Frank Thorp reports that House GOP aides are “cautiously optimistic that the border supplemental can pass with Republican votes, and expect a handful of moderate Democrats to support the measure as well. Leadership is still in the process of whipping the bill, going from member to member during votes trying to quell any concerns they may have. But it was clear that leadership was trying to nip conservative's concerns in the bud Tuesday when Boehner released a statement unequivocally stating that if the Senate tried to add the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill to the supplemental, it would hit a ‘brick wall’ in the House.” Then again, it’s truly remarkable that the House GOP leadership has to fight tooth and nail for a bill that has ZERO chance of becoming reality. To expend political capital internally to make a point, welcome to Washington, circa 2014.Latest on the Highway Trust Fund standoffMeanwhile, here’s the latest on the Highway Trust Fund legislation: “The Senate Tuesday approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through Dec. 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has already promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back,” Roll Call reports. “After the Senate’s version of the bill passed 79 to 18 — Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, R-Utah called it a ‘free vote…because the House is going to send this right back, they are going to strip everything out — after they’ve left’ for the August recess.” So just when it looked like Congress would AVOID a highway trust fund “cliff” of sorts, the threat is back. And this is Senate vs. House stuff -- not necessarily, GOP vs Dem business.Economy grew by 4% in 2nd quarterMore good economic news: “After a dismal winter, the U.S. economy sprang back to life in the April-June quarter, growing at a fast 4 percent annual rate on the strength of higher consumer and business spending,” the AP says. “The Commerce Department says the second-quarter rebound followed a sharp 2.1 percent annualized drop in economic activity in the January-March quarter. That figure was revised up from a previous estimate of a 2.9 percent decline.”Tom Steyer’s TV campaign begins -- against Joni Ernst in IowaThe millions of dollars in TV ads that liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer plans to spend in the midterms is beginning -- with the release of NextGen Climate’s multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst. This new TV ad charges that Ernst is tied to Republican special interests. NextGen Climate says this is the first of a series in ads hitting Ernst, and it’s a $2.6 million buy over five weeks in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and the Quad Cities markets. A little background on Steyer’s involvement this midterm cycle: A Super PAC funded by Democratic environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer has announced it will spend as much as $100 million this election season attacking Republicans in seven key states who it says are climate-science ‘deniers,’ elevating the issue of climate change in these contests.

Of all the 2010 GOP victors, it’s mildly surprising that Kasich now among safer of these incumbents sitting in a swing state.

Bob McDonnell’s rise and fall -- like we have over the past five years -- this was a stunning story. And talk about a twist: “Lawyers for former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell say her marriage had broken down by the time a former CEO began to lavish gifts on her -- and he became her ‘favorite playmate.’ The bombshell was revealed Tuesday during opening statements in a corruption trial against Maureen and her husband, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,” NBC Washington’s Julie Carey reported. More: “The couple arrived separately at federal court over the past two days, a sharp contrast to the united front they showed when they were indicted 10 days after he left office in January. Before the trial, they often held hands in the courthouse. Maureen's defense attorney, Bill Burck, said during opening statements Tuesday that not only was the couple's marriage a wreck, but that Maureen developed feelings for Williams as he took her on a designer clothes shopping trip and showered her with attention. ‘You'd even hear she had a crush on on him. Unfortunately, unlike the other man in her life, Jonnie Williams paid attention to her,’ Burck said.” Here’s what’s particularly stunning: The defense is trying to PROVE a romantic relationship; usually, it’s the other way around.Click here to sign up for First Read emails.

"Losing Arizona Robbins is a huge blow to the very fabric of Grey's Anatomy. The Season 14 finale will be Jessica Capshaw's last episode, and her iconic character that has withstood the test of time. Arizona's story definitely feels like it's been cut much too short of its true potential, but that just means Capshaw will be ready to take on even more new and exciting roles. So what is Jessica Capshaw doing after Grey's Anatomy?  While it doesn't appear that she has any projects on the horizon just yet — at least as far as her IMDB page will divulge — she's already joking with some of TV's biggest names about what her next role will be. Capshaw tweeted to Jane The Virgin creator Jennie Urman in March, praising her work on that show, and Urman responded asking if she could write something for Capshaw next. ""From camp BFF's to comedy wranglers on television,"" Capshaw replied. ""YES PLEASE!""  So, she's apparently open to new possibilities, and Capshaw's fans are eagerly awaiting whatever that next endeavor will be. ""I hope she finds something that makes her as happy and sunshine-y as [Grey's Anatomy] made her,"" Reddit user cattagatta wrote.  Twitter is similarly buzzing with people calling for Arizona spinoffs and Capshaw leading roles.  Capshaw hasn't really made a habit of juggling Grey's Anatomy with any other projects — she only has two other TV credits since joining the Grey's cast in 2009. But now that her schedule is less consumed by Grey's, she'll have time to take a look at what else the industry has to offer.  She's also got four children and a husband, whom she frequently features on her Instagram accounts, and she's proven that she's accustomed to having a lot on her plate. ""A lot of people, especially who are working moms, say it’s all about balance and trying to create a balance, and I respectfully disagree. I don’t know that any part of my day is ever balanced,"" Capshaw told Yahoo late last year. ""I don’t spend equal parts being mom or being a worker, being a wife, being an advocate, being a humanitarian, whatever it is that I am endeavoring to be.""  As she mentioned, Capshaw is definitely an advocate — she's always sharing causes that are important to her, like ending gun violence and achieving pay equity. No matter where she goes from here, something tells me she'll be busy with something. And regardless of where her career goes, it's clear that her role as Arizona will always stay with her.  ""I never would have imagined that I would be able to play a character that would feel like it does so much good, whether it’s people who feel like the character resonates with them and it makes their day a little easier to see themselves represented,"" she said in the same Yahoo interview. ""Or if it’s someone watching it who has someone in their life who is gay and they might have not understood it before and all of a sudden, they have another person or another thing to point to and say, ‘Oh that’s a different context.’ Being able to play a lesbian as a series regular on television has been enormously rewarding.""  There's no denying Arizona has been a hugely inspiring figure on Grey's — she's wowed viewers with her passion for the tiny humans she's healed over the years, she remained resilient in the face of unimaginable hardship, and she was always a friend to those around her. The loss of both her and April will be hard, but it's far from the last we'll see of the actors behind them."
"CLOSE Let's forget about the Brangelina divorce for a bit and talk about their six children.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie attend the New York premiere of 'Changeling' in October 2008. (Photo: Andrew H. Walker, Getty Images)  Brad Pitt is being investigated after being accused of verbal and physical abuse against his children.  Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services spokesman Armand Montiel told USA TODAY by law the agency cannot confirm or deny investigations.  But a source close to Pitt, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told USA TODAY that Pitt is taking this matter ""very seriously and is fully cooperating.""  ""The claims are greatly exaggerated or fabricated,"" the source said. ""But he’ll always do whatever is best for his kids. Despite being on the receiving end of an onslaught of allegations, he remains focused on doing whatever is best for the children.”  TMZ reports the actor, whose wife Angelina Jolie filed for divorce Monday, is under investigation following an incident on a private jet.  TMZ says the case was referred over to the FBI on Thursday due to the fact that the alleged incident happened in the air while the family was on a plane from France last Wednesday.  “The FBI is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued,” FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said in a statement emailed to USA TODAY.  In divorce documents, Jolie listed the couple's date of separation as the following day, Sept. 15.  People.com reports that Pitt is accused of getting verbally abusive with one of couple's kids, as well as getting physical while the family was on their private plane. People and TMZ both note that Jolie and at least some of the couple's other children were present at the time. Pitt and Jolie have six children: Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 8.  The Los Angeles Police Department is so far not investigating. ""LAPD is not handling any report or allegations into child abuse against Brad Pitt,"" spokeswoman Officer Jenny Houser told USA TODAY in a statement on Thursday.  Attempts to reach Jolie's representative were not successful.  Contributing: Maria Puente, Andrea Mandell  Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2cYkvYV"

"Ben Affleck is keeping life with his three kids and his relationship with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus separate, if Jennifer Garner has anything to say about it.  “Jen doesn’t want the kids around Lindsay or having her in their lives. She has many reasons,” a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, who called it quits in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.  Though the Batman star officially got together with Shookus, 38, after Garner and Affleck’s filing, a confidant previously confirmed to Us that their relationship started as early as 2014. As a result, the source notes that one of reasons the Love, Simon actress does not want the Saturday Night Live producer around her kids is “the fact that Ben had an affair with her.”  However, the exes are keeping the peace. According to the insider, “Ben understands and has honored her request.”  “They’re good friends,” the source adds. “She wants him to be honest and he usually is. She tends to find out about things, and Ben is very open with her. They both want what’s best for the kids and have made a commitment to see that through.”  While the estranged couple filed for divorce in 2017, the paperwork has yet to be finalized, partially due to Affleck’s past struggles with alcohol abuse.  “The one thing she’s not flexible on is sobriety,” the source tells Us. “Jen is hesitant to sign off until she’s certain that the kids will be in the best hands at all time. Finalizing the divorce has been a long process because of it.”  For more on Garner and Affleck’s post-divorce relationship, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!

"In the course of the email review, State Department officials determined that some information in the messages should be retroactively classified. In the 3,000 pages that were released, for example, portions of two dozen emails were redacted because they were upgraded to “classified status.” But none of those were marked as classified at the time Mrs. Clinton handled them.In a second memo to Mr. Kennedy, sent on July 17, the inspectors general said that at least one email made public by the State Department contained classified information. The inspectors general did not identify the email or reveal its substance.The memos were provided to The New York Times by a senior government official.The inspectors general also criticized the State Department for its handling of sensitive information, particularly its reliance on retired senior Foreign Service officers to decide if information should be classified, and for not consulting with the intelligence agencies about its determinations.In March, Mrs. Clinton insisted that she was careful in her handling of information on her private account. “I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email,” she said. “There is no classified material. So I’m certainly well aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.”In May, the F.B.I. asked the State Department to classify a section of Mrs. Clinton’s emails that related to suspects who may have been arrested in connection with the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. The information was not classified at the time Mrs. Clinton received it.The revelations about how Mrs. Clinton handled her email have been an embarrassment for the State Department, which has been repeatedly criticized over its handling of documents related to Mrs. Clinton and her advisers."

"Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes have been spotted leaving dinner together in N.Y.C. twice in the last two weeks, but don’t ever expect the ultra-private couple to show any PDA on their way out the door.  “Katie and Jamie are still careful about being photographed together,” a source tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue. “Everyone knows they are dating, but they still want to keep it private.” So they make a point to exit separately.  After first being seen dancing with one another in the Hamptons in 2013 — one year after the actress split from Tom Cruise following six years of marriage — Foxx, 50, and Holmes, 39, have made sure to stay out of the spotlight.

"Pearl Street Films, the production company co-founded by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, will adopt inclusion riders for their projects going forward, following in the footsteps of Outlier Society, the production company started by Black Panther star Michael B. Jordan.  “Thank you for always supporting broader representation in the industry,” Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni, head of strategic outreach at Pearl Street Films tweeted in response to Jordan on Monday night. “On behalf of Pearl Street Films, Matt Damon, @BenAffleck, Jennifer Todd, Drew Vinton, & I will be adopting the #InclusionRider for all of our projects moving forward.”  .@michaelb4jordan Thank you for always supporting broader representation in the industry. On behalf of Pearl Street Films, Matt Damon, @BenAffleck, Jennifer Todd, Drew Vinton & I will be adopting the #InclusionRider for all of our projects moving forward. https://t.co/ODit24D2Rb — Fanshen (@fanshen) March 13, 2018  Jordan, Affleck, and Damon have adopted inclusion riders following Frances McDormand’s best actress acceptance speech at the Oscars on March 4, where the Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri star closed her remarks by mentioning the term. An inclusion rider is a way for actors and actresses to guarantee projects they work on have a level of diversity, onscreen and off-camera, that matches the location setting of the project. Stacy L. Smith, the director of USC Annenberg’s Media, Diversity & Social Change Initiative, first discussed the idea of an “equity rider” in a 2014 column for The Hollywood Reporter as a way to reverse Hollywood’s profound gender imbalance.  In a statement to Variety, Smith and Kalpana Kotagal, one of the lawyers working on the inclusion riders, said of the Pearl Street Films announcement, “It’s great to see Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and the Pearl Street Films team using their influence to create opportunities for people from underrepresented groups to enter the industry. The Inclusion Rider is an important tool for Hollywood, and other industries, to create workplaces that truly reflect our diverse world.”  Under their Pearl Street Films banner, Affleck and Damon have produced films such as Manchester By the Sea, Jason Bourne, and Live By Night, among other features and television series, and are currently working on Matt Reeves’ The Batman (with Affleck still set to star as the Caped Crusader) and Affleck’s remake of Witness for the Prosecution."
"Perez Hilton has fired back at Jennifer Lawrence‘s Vanity Fair comments in which she took the gossip blogger to task for publishing hacked nude photos of her.  “I’m not trying to be Oprah. I am just a better version of me than I was 10 years ago,” Hilton said in a video posted on his website Monday. “Do I still have work to do? Can I still be even better? Fuck yeah, but I am not that person in the past. And if you’re trying to keep me in the prison that is the past, then fuck you!”  Hilton then said, “So, actually this video is for Jennifer Lawrence, to say ‘fuck you’! And I’m going to get in trouble for that, but I don’t give a shit.”  See photos: Party Report in Pictures: Jennifer Lawrence, Reese Witherspoon, Jon Stewart and SNL’s Week Off  As TheWrap previously reported, the Oscar-winning actress scolded Hilton in the November issue of Vanity Fair for posting — and then removing — nude photos of her that emerged in August as part of the massive celebrity photo hack. Kate Upton, Kaley Cuoco and Meagan Good were also targeted.  “He took it down because people got pissed, and that’s the only reason why,” Lawrence said. “And then I had to watch his apology. And what he basically said was ‘I just didn’t think about it’ … ‘I just didn’t think about it’ is not an excuse. That is the exact issue itself.”  But Hilton, whose real name is Mario Lavandeira, wasn’t happy with her characterization of his previous apology.  Also read: Jennifer Lawrence Slams Gossip Blogger Perez Hilton for Posting Her Nude Photos  “She mentions how she was forced to watch the video I made right after her naked photos surfaced online. In that video, I apologized to her sincerely from my heart,” he said in Monday’s video. “And I did so more than once. And I was tempted to apologize to her again, but you know what … No. Fuck that. Life isn’t always what you want. And you don’t always get what you ask for,” Hilton said.  “That video that I made and me explaining my thought process was real, it was sincere, and it wasn’t some bullshit made up excuse.”  He wasn’t finished. After dropping those aforementioned f-bombs, Hilton then called Lawrence out for bringing up his past. And he also strangely brought up actor Robert Downey Jr.  Also read: Meagan Good Rips Fans for Reposting Her Leaked Nude Photos: ‘You Should Be Ashamed’  “When you think about Robert Downey Jr. , you don’t think ‘oh, he’s a drug addict’ or ‘a recovering drug addict.’ You think about that actor that you truly love,” he said.  But eventually Hilton changed his tune and said sorry.  “You were extremely hurt. I contributed to that. I genuinely am sorry,” he said. “I hope that you can look inside my brain and see that I truly, truly did not pre-meditatively, purposely decide to hurt you. And that’s all that I have to say, I will not be making any more comments on this.”  “Or maybe I will.”"
"Travis Scott wanted Kylie Jenner to celebrate Thanksgiving with him in Houston but she said now.

The insider brought up that Travis and Cactus Jack Records hosted a turkey drive for Hurricane Harvey relief in downtown Houston on Nov. 23. “He was begging her to come out and do it with him, but she said no. She doesn’t want to be photographed at all right now. They had a bit of a fight over it. He’s proud of her and wanted her there by his side. He was disappointed she wouldn’t come.”  Oh no! Does this mean that Kylie and her alleged baby daddy are on the rocks? Thankfully, this was just a bump in the road, as the insider told HollywoodLife.com that “they made up” afterward. “He can’t ever stay mad at her for long but this whole thing of her wanting to say in hiding is an issue for him. He’s trying his best to be understanding but he does question this whole need for her to stay in hiding,” the insider added. “He doesn’t really get it.  Travis may need to “get it” soon, because Kylie reportedly doesn’t want to go out in public until her alleged baby is born. She wants to “disappear” and focus on her health and happiness during this reported pregnancy, and she reportedly won’t even address it until she gives birth. Kylie is also reportedly “horrified” with how her body has changed with pregnancy, and the last thing she wants to do is leave the house. Well, it seems Travis better not expect Ky to join him if he celebrates Christmas in Clutch City. Maybe next year?  What do you think Travis and Kylie should do, HollywoodLifers? Do you think he should be more understanding?"
"If you always wanted to go shoe shopping with Sarah Jessica Parker (and who doesn’t?), you’re out of luck. The Sex & the City star launched a shopping excursion with Airbnb on Monday, September 25, and it already sold out in just two hours.  The $400 price tag for the “Sole in the City with SJP” experience scores you a chance to have the shoe designer help you handpick a pair of shoes from her SJP Collection at Bloomingdale’s, a post-shopping snack of fro yo and a ticket to the New York City Ballet show, along with facetime with SJP herself.  “What better way to meet than at Bloomingdale’s 59th Street, an iconic NYC landmark, for what I hope is an unforgettable shoe-shopping experience,” Parker, 52, explains on the Airbnb site. “I’ll help you find the perfect pair of shoes from the SJP Collection to complete your look. As we peruse the shoe department, I’ll tell you about the line and how the city that never sleeps helped inspire it. Next we’ll head to Forty Carrots for what some may say is the best frozen yogurt in NYC and we’ll chat about my city and why I’ve called it home for so many years. After that, I’ll send you off in your new SJP shoes to a special evening at the exquisite and incomparable New York City Ballet. You’ll have some of the best seats in the house, plus some VIP surprises. It’ll be a night you won’t soon forget.”  Considering a pair of her shoes retail for between $295-$545 alone, this is actually a great deal! The bad news is there were only four spots available and they’re already booked. The good news that all proceeds from the experience go to help fund the New York City Ballet.  Going shoe shopping with a celebrity while giving back to the arts is something Stylish can totally get behind. Fingers crossed SJP does more of these in the future!

"The Emmys red carpet took a page from “The Handmaid’s Tale.”  While television’s brightest stars sashayed in a Technicolor parade on Sunday, red and white - a la the crimson cloaks and snowy bonnets worn by the enslaved women on the Hulu series based on Margaret Atwood’s book - emerged as the night’s biggest winners. (Which was fitting, considering ""The Handmaid's Tale"" won Best Drama, along with Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress in a Drama.) And everything shimmered with sequins and beading.  Nicole Kidman was among the best dressed of the night in a red halter Calvin Klein Calvin Klein by Appointment gown with a pleated bust. “Handmaid’s” Yvonne Strahovski also worked the red hot shade in a custom Julien MacDonald silk number, as did Sarah Hyland in a fiery cutout Zac Posen, Heidi Klum in plunging Peter Dundas, and Issa Rae in an asymmetrical Vera Wang. (""The Handmaid's Tale"" author Margaret Atwood was also notably in red.)  “A red dress is fiery, it’s sexy, it’s a universal power color,” celebrity stylist Robert Verdi told Moneyish. “And it also says ‘resistance’ in my opinion, so it makes a strong statement.”  Viola Davis wore Zac Posen. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)  The white haute women included Evan Rachel Wood in a Moschino gown with cropped tuxedo jacket, Priyanka Chopra in long-sleeved Balmain, Sofia Vergara in a strapless figure-hugging Mark Zunino mermaid gown, and “Stranger Things’” adorable Millie Bobby Brown in a ballerina-inspired Calvin Klein gown with full tulle princess skirt.  Priyanka Chopra wore Balmain. (Rich Polk/Getty Images)  “White always emerges when people are desperate for change in our culture,” mused Verdi, “because it’s a blank canvas for new beginnings.”  And the summer’s glitter trend was on full display, with sequins and beads dusted across almost everyone, including Lea Michele’s belted purple Elie Saab gown, Tracee Ellis Ross’s silver Chanel disco ball, Leslie Jones’ black sparkling Christian Siriano, and Ellie Kemper’s midnight blue capsleeve Jenny Packham gown.  “Glitter is so hot right now, and it was sparkle, sparkle, sparkle everywhere, and lots of sequin sand silver,” Tom Fitzgerald, co-creator of the fashion and pop culture blog TomandLorenzo.com with Lorenzo Marquez, told Moneyish.  Other standouts included Viola Davis in juicy orange Zac Posen, Jane Fonda in long-sleeved hot pink Brandon Maxwell (with long, sleek ponytail to match), and both Tessa Thompson and Zoe Kravitz chasing the rainbow; the former in a pleated metallic Rosie Assoulin, and the latter in a feathery cascading Dior.  Tessa Thompson wore Rosie Assoui. (Rich Polk/Getty Images)  “There were a lot of movie stars on the red carpet this year, so there was a heightened sense of glamour. If you know Nicole Kidman is going to be there, you’re gonna bring your A game,” said Fitzgerald. “And we are at peak TV with all of the incredible programming now, so it’s become more much competitive, and the Emmys are closer in tone to the Oscars than it used to be.”  While the Emmys ratings have dipped the past couple of years, more than 11 million people tuned into last year’s awards show - and the glamorous gowns worn by the nominees and presenters on any awards show red carpet influence what the $15.6 billion dress industry will put on the rack next spring. Remember when Amal Clooney wore white opera gloves to the 2015 Golden Globes? Long gloves appeared on the fall/winter runways of Marc Jacobs and Prada later that year.  Millie Bobby Brown wore Calvin Klein. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)  “You’ll see silhouettes shift now, thanks to the classic and demure 1950s and 60s looks on Nicole Kidman and Millie Bobby Brown, that kind of princess-style dress,” said Verdi. “You’ll see these popular colors (red, white, silver, the pops of orange and green) trickle down into ready-to-wear fashion. And you’ll see the fabrics - like the sparkle and lace we saw on the carpet - be used to embellish affordable versions of these gowns.”  And you may even be able to snap up at least one of Sunday’s red carpet looks yourself. While many movie and TV stories are loaned their designer gowns for these award shows - or are sometimes paid between $100,000 and $250,000 to wear a label for all of the free publicity it will bring the brand - singer and presenter Rachel Bloom revealed to E! that she had to pay for her $3,500 Gucci gown out of pocket.  “A lot of fashion houses are reluctant to lend clothes that aren’t in the sample sizes of 0 and 2, so it’s getting harder and harder for me to find clothes without buying them,” she said. “That’s the whole problem with the fashion industry: My body size is literally normal and healthy but when you put me next to a model I look obese.”  Rachel Bloom bought her Gucci gown. ""It's hard to get places to lend me dresses b/c I'm not a size 0, but I can afford it so it's OK"" #Emmys pic.twitter.com/pevV8HgfWj — Jarett Wieselman (@JarettSays) September 17, 2017  Verdi noted this is an issue because the competition for these couture gowns is fierce.  “There’s only a few great dresses in any given collection every season, and every stylist is trying to pull them for the celebrities that they are dressing,” he said. “So when the fashion houses are assessing who these should go to, they want it to go to a nominee over a presenter; to a global star versus a national star; to someone younger over someone older - those are what the ‘rules’ would be.”  And, often, to someone slimmer over someone curvier, as stars like Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones (both nominated Sunday night) have been public about their struggles to find designers to dress them.  But Bloom noted that she’s fortunate to be in a financial position where she can buy her dress. And she might get some money back for the gently-used gown, anyway.  “I can always resell it,” she said. “I do have an account on [the resell/consignment site] The RealReal. My writing partner sells all of her clothes there. Take a look on The Real Real for this dress tomorrow.”  See the world with cash-color glasses.

"Kathryn C. Dennis knows how tough a reunion taping can be. And the Southern Charm mom was certainly feeling the pressure of having to relive every moment viewers watched of her life during last season's sit-down. So when it came time to film the Season 4 reunion, she went into the event with a very different mind frame.  ""I’m hoping to express a little less than I did last year, but you know. I don’t know; I’m just hoping that people can see that through out all of this you can’t make me tick. That is what people push me to do,"" she explained to The Daily Dish. ""They’re waiting on me to stress out enough to where I crack or something. And I want to show them that they can’t do that anymore.""  Part 1 of the Season 4 reunion put Kathryn in the hot seat, with the Charleston native having to open up about why she went to rehab as well as her life as a mom (she has two kids with ex, Thomas Ravenel) and her former friendship with Jennifer Snowden. And she knew that when it came to having to face the tough questions and issues, she wanted to deal with it in a different way than she's done in the past. ""So, they’re probably expecting — or not knowing what to expect when they see me, but that’s a good thing 'cause I’m gonna surprise them I think,"" she said.  As for last year's outfit, well, Kathryn doesn't look to fondly on that. ""Fashion, what is it? Flop. Ugh, it was bad, but I mean it was cute but all in a different outfit,"" she reflected. ""Like the top with something else, the bottom with something else. I don’t know. But this year I love my dress. It’s like badass basically is what I’m trying to get at.""

"Princess Eugenie kept her bridal look under wraps in the weeks leading up to her royal wedding to fiancé Jack Brooksbank. But the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson‘s dress was finally revealed on Friday as she walked down the aisle of St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle wearing a custom Peter Pilotto gown.  So how does her Peter Pilotto dress compare to her cousins’ Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle‘s gowns?  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Getty; AP (2)  Press Association via AP Images  The 28-year-old royal cousin of Prince William and Prince Harry chose a long-sleeve, low-back design from the London-based label, which was founded in 2007 by Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos.  YUI MOK/AFP/Getty Images  The dress features a neckline that folds around the shoulders to a low back that drapes into a flowing full length train. The low back feature on the dress was at the request of Eugenie, who had surgery at 12 years old to correct her scoliosis.  Press Association via AP Images  “I think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think it’s really special to stand up for that,” she told the U.K.’s This Morning.  Pilotto and De Vos worked with Eugenie to research previous dresses worn by members of the royal family to identify the right silhouette for her wedding.  James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock  The fabric of her gown features a number of motifs that hold particularly special meaning to Eugenie. The symbols include a thistle for Scotland, to acknowledge her and Jack’s fondness for Balmoral, a shamrock for Ireland as a reflection of her maternal family, the York rose and ivy to represent the couple’s home.  The only bit of information she revealed before her big day was that she wanted to pick a designer from her home country. “[The dress] is the one thing that I was really decisive about,” she told British Vogue. “As soon as we announced the wedding, I knew the designer, and the look, straight away. I never thought I’d be the one who knew exactly what I like, but I’ve been pretty on top of it.”  RELATED VIDEO: Celebrity Guests Arrive at Princess Eugenie’s Wedding  Unlike Kate and Meghan, however, Princes Eugenie chose not to wear a veil.  For Kate’s 2011 wedding to Prince William, she stuck with a British-based designer too, wearing a custom Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen lace long-sleeve, V-neck gown.  Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images  But it was Meghan’s long-sleeved, unembellished gown that switched-up the British designer trend. U.K. designer Clare Waight Keller designed her custom creation, but for the brand, Givenchy, which is a French fashion house.  Meghan Markle  Can’t get enough of PEOPLE’s Royals coverage?

Princess Eugenie wore the Greville Emerald Kokoshnik Tiara, lent to her by the Queen. The tiara is made of brilliant and rose cut diamonds pavé set in platinum, with six emeralds on either side and was bequeathed by Mrs. Greville to Queen Elizabeth in 1942.  Both Kate and Meghan also wore tiaras straight from the Queen’s jewelry vault. Kate wore the Cartier Halo tiara and Meghan wore the Queen Mary Diamond Bandeau."

(March 14) AP  Scotty McCreery and Gaby Dugal arrive for the 53rd annual Academy of Country Music Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on April 15. (Photo: NINA PROMMER/EPA-EFE)  Scotty McCreery married his longtime girlfriend Gabi Dugal on Saturday in North Carolina in front of more than 200 guests.  The couple met when they were in kindergarten.  The 24-year-old winner of ""American Idol"" Season 10 and Dugal got engaged in September at their favorite spot near Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina.  “I’ve been planning this moment for so long that it feels surreal for it to have finally happened,” McCreery said in a statement announcing their engagement. “Gabi is the perfect girl and my true love, and I cannot wait to begin building our life together as husband and wife.”  The country singer got down on one knee and proposed with a ring he helped design.  People has the first photo from the wedding, which shows Dugal in a sleeveless, V-neck white gown by Morilee and carrying a white bouquet, with McCreery wearing a basic black tuxedo. The site reports that the couple chose Elvis Presley's ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" for their first dance.  Dugal, a pediatric cardiac nurse at Duke University Hospital, was smitten with McCreery even in kindergarten, writing “Mrs. Gabi McCreery” surrounded by hearts in her diary.  The song ""This Is It"" from McCreery's album ""Seasons Change"" is about their engagement.  Contributing: Kim Willis  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2MwpSkJ"

"HARRY POTTER AT KING'S CROSS  HARRY POTTER LONDON LOCATIONS - DIRECTIONS When you arrive at King's Cross. Northern Line Station go through the ticket barrier, walk up the steps directly ahead and turn left at the top. Turn immediately right following the sign and arrow pointing to ""St Pancras International. "" Keep ahead through the passage and, just before you arrive at the ticket machines on the left, go up the stairs where the arrow and sign point to ""stairs to street level. Turn left at the top of those stairs, and go left again at the ""Way Out and Euston Road"" sign. Once on Euston Road turn right and follow the red brick wall then pause on the right just before the phone box.  ST PANCRAS STATION - KING'S CROSS EXTERIOR  The interior of St Pancras has recently undergone a major refurbishment and looks every bit as grand as it did in its Victorian heyday.  Although Harry Potter and his schoolmates board the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross Station, the exterior used in the films was in fact the one that now looms over you, St Pancras Station.  It was on the corner of the courtyard to your left that Harry and Ron park the Ford Anglia in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  Later in the film, when they find themselves unable to pass through the wall on to Platform nine-and-three-quarters, they return to the Ford Anglia and fly off over the station. The clock that towers over you to your right is shown in this flight scene.  HARRY POTTER LONDON LOCATIONS - DIRECTIONS Backtrack and keep going past the exit via which you came out of the station. Keep ahead to cross Pancras Road via the traffic light crossing (heading towards King's Cross Station). On the other side of the crossing veer left and pass to the right of the large circular silver structure on which there is a white on blue sign pointing to ""King's Cross."" Keep ahead to enter King's Cross Station. Once inside the station keep straight ahead, following the sign that points to Platforms 9 to 11 Keep ahead past the ticket office and then pass to the right of the Disabled Meeting Point sign. Keep ahead past the Cash machines and on the right, directly under the footbridge, is Platform 9 3/4.  PLATFORM NINE-AND-THREE-QUARTERS  Although not an actual film location this brown brick wall has become a magnet to Harry Potter fans from all over the world.  They come to photograph the sign, which the station authorities have obligingly put up in honour of the station's most famous passenger.  Even more obliging is the fact that the station staff have also taken the trouble to place a luggage cart against the wall which looks as though it is half way in to the wall, as though some young witch or wizard is proceeding on their way to board the Hogwarts Express!  You can take photographs of yourself and the children, or just yourself, or, if you can enlist the services of a passing passenger, of all of you, pushing at the cart as though you too are on your way to wizard land!  HARRY POTTER LONDON LOCATIONS - DIRECTIONS Continue past Platform 9 3/4 and, a little further along on the right is the Harry Potter Shop.  THE HARRY POTTER SHOP  Styled to resemble Ollivander's wand shop, complete with wooden panelling and lots of draws, the Harry Potter Shop has something for everyone.  You can, if you wish, splash out and purchase exact replicas of the wands used in the films by Harry, Ron or Hermione; there is a selection of jumpers in the various House colours; or you can marvel at a display of Horcruxes.  If your tastes incline more towards the discreet and understated, then you can choose from a selection of hoodies in a variety of colours, all with Platform 9 ¾ emblazoned on them.  And, if you’re seeking a more modestly priced souvenir then you can plum for a selection of board games. Key rings, mugs, soft toys or action figures.  HARRY POTTER LONDON LOCATIONS - DIRECTIONS Backtrack and, just before the entrance you came in by, turn left passing beneath the white on blue sign for Platforms 0 to 8. Keep ahead, passing to the left of the Ticket Machines and, once past the glass and silver gate go left and keep ahead to the grey shutter by Platform 5. Unfortunately you can’t actually go onto the platform itself without a ticket, so you’ll have to look along the platforms from this side of the barrier.  THE ENTRANCE TO  PLATFORM NINE-AND-THREE-QUARTERS  King’s Cross has appeared in every Harry Potter film because the journey to Hogwarts aboard the Hogwarts Express starts from King's Cross Platform 9¾, which is invisible to the eyes of muggles, and which is reached by walking through the wall between platforms 9 and 10.  However, King’s Cross Station posed a slight problem for the film makers in that Platforms 9 and 10 aren’t actually adjacent to one another.  The problem was overcome by re-numbering Platforms 4 and 5. Thus Platform 9¾ is in fact situated between these two platforms ahead of you, which are separated by picturesque brick arches.  In the Harry Potter films the Hogwarts Express pulls into the far end of the platform.  In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Mr and Mrs Weasley pass through the portal but when Harry and Ron try to do so they just hit the wall and fall to the ground. A nearby porter eyes them suspiciously and asks what they think they're doing, to which Harry replies ""sorry lost control of trolley.""  Realising that they can't get on to the platform they hurry back to the forecourt (St Pancras which you visited earlier) and take off in the Ford Anglia.  HARRY MEETS DUMBELDORE’S SPIRIT  In the Deathly Hallows Part Two Harry is hit with a killing curse by Lord Voldemort, and he enters a Limbo state in which his spirit meets with that of Albus Dumbledore at a location that Harry identifies as King's Cross Station “only cleaner.""  OUR LAST GLIMPSE OF HARRY, RON AND HERMIONE  It is on the platforms ahead that we catch our last glimpse of Harry, Ron and Hermione in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two when they bring their children here to pass through the wall and onto Platform 9¾ to begin their first journey to Hogwarts.  WHY J. K. ROWLING CHOSE KING’S CROSS  The reason J. K. Rowling chose King’s Cross Station as the place from which the Hogwarts Express departs was because her parents actually met at King’s Cross which is why the station had special significance to her."

"When members of the royal family tie the knot, there’s a lot at stake—including a whole lot of money. Which is why it might be surprising to some onlookers that, according to the Daily Mail, Prince Harry has declined to seek a prenuptial agreement before he marries Meghan Markle today in Windsor. But we spoke to two royal experts who said nobody should be shocked at this news. When it comes to the royals, prenups are simply not done.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  This is not a celebrity marriage, it’s a royal marriage.  “I don’t think members of the royal family sign prenuptial agreements,” says Katie Nicholl, author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love. “It’s commonplace with celebrity marriage, but this is not a celebrity marriage, it’s a royal marriage.” Nicholl says that Prince William and Kate Middleton also did not sign a prenuptial agreement, despite the very public divorce between William and Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. And even though three of the Queen’s four children have divorced, none apparently had a prenuptial agreement.  Yes, there is a large sum of money in the balance for this marriage, but the true, staggering wealth belongs to the Queen, so it wouldn’t be divided up if Meghan and Harry did end up divorcing. “You wouldn’t need a prenuptial agreement to stop Windsor Castle from being cut in half in the event they divorce, because it’s not Harry’s,” says Duncan Larcombe, author of Prince Harry: The Inside Story.  Larcombe notes that Harry does have substantial wealth on his own, thanks to his inheritance from Princess Diana, but the Queen holds the vast majority of the royal property and fortune. The Queen's net worth has been estimated at around $500 million, while Prince Harry's is estimated anywhere from $25 to $40 million. Meghan also has her own money as a successful actress on Suits, reportedly making around $50,000 per episode of the long-running series.  If Meghan and Harry do ever divorce, Larcombe adds, the vast majority of negotiations would happen outside of court. For example, Diana received a new title, a financial settlement, and was entitled to royal security protection, although she turned that down. Plus, the Daily Mail notes that even though prenups are taken into account in U.K. divorces, they’re not legally enforceable.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  And though royal divorces may have had a violent start, thanks to Henry VIII’s habit for decapitation, royal splits try to make as few waves as possible in modern times. “In the modern history of the royal family, the divorce is described as amicable for PR reasons,” Larcombe says, “and the person who is departing the royal family, they’re just looked after, and those arrangements are not done through court, they’re done behind closed doors.”"
"Maddox Jolie-Pitt is not happy with his mom, Angelina Jolie, after she visited the grave of Pol Pot – the murderous dictator responsible for killing 3 million Cambodians – and now he has defiantly demanded to live with his dad, Brad Pitt. Sources say that after he found out about his mother’s visit, the Cambodian-born Jolie Pitt immediately called his dad and begged to live with him.  Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge party ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979 and slaughtered millions through starvation, work camps, and mass executions on the notorious “killing fields.” Locals say that Jolie has visited the grave multiple times, the first being in 1998, and then again in 2001 during the trip where she adopted Maddox.  Angelina Jolie Takes Her Kids to the Toronto International Film Festival–but Maddox Jolie-Pitt Is Noticeably M.I.A. https://t.co/y3cw9EAJFE — E! News (@enews) September 11, 2017  “Brad tried to soothe him, saying Angie is interested in the history of the country where she found Maddox,” reveals an insider. “He also explained that he needs to be careful while the pair’s lawyers work out custody of all their kids — and to hold tight until he could speak with her about it.”  Ironically, it was Maddox who got into a physical confrontation with Pitt back in September 2016 during that infamous flight that led to the couple’s split. Jolie claimed this was evidence of Pitt’s abusive behavior towards their six children.  But now, according to Radar Online, the 16-year-old understands that his mom’s behavior ignited problems in their family, and it is the 42-year-old actress who is the instigator of many of their family woes.  The fact that Jolie visits the warlord’s resting place is “galling” to Maddox, according to insiders, and he doesn’t understand how she could save him from such an evil place and then return to it like it is a shrine. But, whether Maddox winds up with Pitt is still in question.  Pitt and Jolie are still in the middle of hashing out a custody agreement and divorce settlement, but a year and a half after their split, Pitt is happy again and in “high spirits.” After taking time to focus on himself, the 54-year-old has slowly made his way back into the spotlight and is currently dating Neri Oxman, who is a professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab.  His separation from Jolie was a sad and shocking situation for Pitt, but he has started taking  “Separating was very sad and shocking to him, but he started taking care of himself again,” says an insider. “He seems much, much happier.”  Pitt met Oxman through an architecture project at MIT last fall, and since then he has been making regular trips to the east coast to spend time with the new woman in his life.

"The budding romance between Josh Duhamel and Eiza González is heating up!  The Love, Simon star and the Baby Driver actress were spotted getting incredibly cozy on a romantic getaway near Muyil on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico over the weekend. Photos of the two show them kissing and holding one another as they took a trip on the Muyil Lagoon. González, 28, was seen sporting a skimpy, sharkskin bikini, while Duhamel, 45, wore white board shorts during their aquatic romp.  It's unclear how long the two have been an item. It's been less than a month since the couple decided to go public, but they reportedly kept their relationship under wraps out of respect for Fergie, whom Duhamel separated with in September after eight years of marriage. The two have a 4-year-old son together, Axl.  BACKGRID  ""He felt guilty that he had feelings for another woman so quickly and he wants to be respectful to Fergie so he has kept this relationship very, very private,"" a source told ET in June, when the couple finally stepped out in public.  A source later told ET that the two have ""fallen head over heels for each other.""  For more on Duhamel's new flame, watch the video below.

"At this point in time, the whole “teaser for the trailer” thing is so normalized that it is no longer surprising. But there are two interesting bits right off the bat about this Fifty Shades Freed teaser. First, at 66 seconds, it’s damn well long enough to be the full trailer. At this point, you’re either in or you’re out concerning this third film in E.L. James’ bondage-flavored romantic drama. Aside from maybe Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I can’t think of a movie that needs less of an actual marketing campaign, at least in terms of spoiler-y footage.  Second, it teases the actual theatrical trailer for November, meaning this is a two-months’ early sneak peak of said trailer. That may be a something of a record. Sony dropped a Ghostbusters trailer teaser on Feb. 14, 2016 in advance of its March 3, 2016 trailer launch, but I can’t think of any movie that debuted their trailer teaser two months in advance. I can only assume we’ll see the trailer attached to STX Entertainment’s A Bad Moms Christmas unless Universal/Comcast Corp. feels like being funny and attaching it to Sony’s The Star. As for the actual teaser, the footage is at least somewhat promising a bit kinky sex than we had the last time out. So at least this time fans might get what they paid for.  Fifty Shades Darker was essentially about how Anastasia Steele (still a great name for a 007 villain) molded Mr. Grey into “husband material,” which meant a lot more conventional sex but a lot less kink. Also of note, we get more conventional violence this time out, including a guy who I presume is Steele’s former boss holding a knife to her throat. So for those who want rescue fantasies with their BDSM, there you go.  Twenty dollars says we’ll get far more thinkpieces about Steele’s consensual sexual activities than about the violence directed upon her sans her consent, but that’s a conversation for another day. At this point, the Fifty Shades trilogy is a lot like The Hobbit trilogy, in that the first film made so much money ($571 million worldwide) that the next two are essentially paid for. Sam Taylor-Johnson’s Fifty Shades of Grey cost $40 million and James Foley’s Fifty Shades Darker cost $55m. Assuming Fifty Shades Freed cost around the same (let’s say $65m to potentially over exaggerate just in case), we’re looking at a trilogy that cost Universal and friends $160m.  So the first film alone made back 3.5x the budget of the entire series. And since the sequel made $379 million worldwide, we’re already at $950m worldwide with one more to go. Even if this installment takes another dive and makes (spitballing it here) $250m worldwide, we’re still looking at a $1.2 billion total gross for these R-rated, female-targeted erotic dramas. Even if it pulls a Divergent, it's still all gravy (and the franchise is over after this one anyway). It’s almost like Universal made a non-tentpole movie into an event by creating an A-level release out of something entirely unlike anything else in the marketplace and targeted at an underserved demographic. Hmm…  Fifty Shades Freed, starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, opens Feb. 9, 2018."

"There's a chance for another Brad and Jen, but this time it isn't Jennifer Aniston. Multiple reports are claiming that Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Pitt are now dating.  Both stars are newly single, Lawrence recently split from director boyfriend Darren Aronofsky and Pitt is in the process of divorcing longtime partner and wife of two years, Angelia Jolie.  Rumors of their romance began on Wednesday and the story graces the cover of this week’s issue of Star Magazine. Sources told the publication that “Brad has had his eye on Jennifer for years. [They] have been enjoying lots of late nights together. There’s an intense connection between them!”  An insider also told the magazine that Pitt allegedly reached out to Lawrence after getting her phone number from a mutual friend. The source added that Pitt was nervous to contact Lawrence, but was encouraged by friends to make the first move.  However, the tabloid checking website Gossip Cop reported that despite reports about the two A-listers becoming a pair, for now the rumors remain just rumors.  According to The Sun, Lawrence broke up with Aronofsy after a year of dating due to their great difference in age. But age hasn’t seemed to stop Lawrence before. Before dating Aronofsky, Lawrence had a short fling with Coldplay lead singer and ex-husband a Gwyneth Paltrow, Chris Martin — Paltrow being another common thread between her and Brad.  Prior to dating Martin, Lawrence dated her 28-year-old “X-Men” co-star, Nicolas Hoult, for five years off and on. The two ended their relationship in August of 2014.  The Sun also reported that sources close to Pitt have denied the dating rumors and said that he and Lawrence are not together."
"She may be half his age, but it looks like she's all-in on this relationship.  At age 34, Katharine McPhee is engaged to her boyfriend, 68-year-old David Foster.  A rep for the former “American Idol” star confirmed the engagement with Fox News Wednesday.  TMZ reported the celebrated music producer popped the question during their European vacation.  While it’s unknown which day he proposed, the celebrity gossip site claimed McPhee was flaunting her engagement ring while on the Italian island of Capri Sunday. She was also allegedly showing off her rock to family and friends on FaceTime.  This will be McPhee’s second marriage and Foster’s fifth. The music mogul was previously married to B.J. Cook, Rebecca Dyer, Linda Thompson and Yolanda Hadid.  The couple first sparked dating rumors in May 2017, but wouldn’t confirm their relationship until late last year.  In October, Foster’s 35-year-old daughter Erin praised McPhee to People Magazine.  “She’s amazing,” gushed Erin at the time. “I really like her. She’s awesome. My dad is kind of a hopeless romantic, and Katherine’s awesome. We really, really like her, and we’ve known her for a really long time. And if he’s happy, we’re happy.”  And McPhee hasn't been shy about praising her beau.  Capri bayybeeee A post shared by Katharine McPhee (@katharinemcphee) on Jun 30, 2018 at 5:52am PDT  “… I just pinch myself when I get to spend time with him on a personal level,” McPhee told Entertainment Tonight in September. “I love his outlook on life and how he treats people. He’s really a special person in my life.  ""What I’ve learned from him is how lucky we are to do what we do. He’s always reminding me and it’s comforting to know that it’s people to walk through this life he’s had – working with incredible people, being friends with ex-presidents and world leaders – and still have that perspective. He’s so well-connected, but still just a simple guy from Canada with his little Canadian accent!”  McPhee also told Health magazine in December she has known Foster for years. The couple previously collaborated for a few live performances, including his 2008 PBS tribute concert “Hit Man: David Foster & Friends.”  “We’re very close friends, and we’ve been friends for a long time,” said the “American Idol” Season 5 runner-up. “I’m really, really fond of him, and I think he’s an incredible person. I’ve known him since I was 21 years old, you know? He produced my first single. So he’s been really good to me. People can say whatever they want.”"

"Tracee Ellis Ross was one of the brave few to show up on the Met Gala red carpet actually wearing one of Rei Kawakubo's Commes Des Garçons designs , becoming part of an exclusive group that included Rihanna and Caroline Kennedy . The Black-ish actress chose a sculptural blue outfit from CDG's Spring 2016 ""Blue Witch"" collection. While it may not have been as constricting as Helen Lasichanh's arm-encumbering red CDG outfit, the runway piece wasn't exactly designed with practicality in mind, as is the case with much Commes Des Garçons.  Still, as Ross explained last night on Jimmy Kimmel Live! , she felt it was an honor to wear it. Should it be such a surprise that the daughter of one of pop's greatest fashion risk takers, Diana Ross , would be completely fine with exchanging her full range of arm movement for a once-in-a-lifetime red carpet moment?  Kimmel, of course, is not exactly enamored by the world of fashion and is often bemused at its excesses (see his feud with Kanye West over the idea of leather jogging pants, in particularly). So naturally he had to have Ross walk him through why she chose to wear the look.  Ross explained she was attending as a guest of online retailer Farfetched, which just happens to carry Comme Des Garçons, so she actually got to wear a piece from the label (many other celebs attended as the guests of other fashion labels, and as per tradition and common courtesy, wore their host's creations, and thus explaining why so few celebs seemed to go full-out with the theme).  ""The designer who was the cochair was Comme Des Garçons, Rei Kawakubo. So she's a very avant-garde designer. Very arts meet fashion,"" explained an excited Ross. ""So I got to wear a Commes Des Garçons dress""  ""It was such a big deal in fashion, and it was a huge deal for me,"" continued Ross. ""I feel like my mom taught me about glamour, and growing up I was a big fashion girl. I had magazines and loved that world, and so it was a big deal. It was a very big deal to wear that designer.""  After a picture of Ross in the outfit popped up behind the host, Ross had to convince him for a second that it was actually a big fashion moment, but did admit its particularly drawbacks.  ""As you can tell, there's not a lot of movement I could do in the dress,"" she explained. ""So it was a little bit like...couldn't lift me arms up, couldn't hug people because if I lift my arms up too high the dress would come up.""  Kimmel's take away: he thought about the idea of teaming up with Kawakubo to get celebrities to wear the most ridiculous things possible in the name of fashion.  ""I'm going to contact Rei, and Rei and I are going to work out a scheme where we come up with the most ridiculous things and try to get famous people to wear them.  ""I'm going to put somebody in a big Sprite bottle.""  Actually, dressing someone in a Sprite bottle sounds more like Jeremy Scott for Moschino than Rei Kawakubo to us, but point taken.

"CBS’ new top programming executives addressed the network’s struggles with onscreen diversity Tuesday — including the recent controversy over the departure of two Asian actors from “Hawaii Five-0.”  “We love both those actors and did not want to lose them,” CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl said at the Television Critics Association press tour on Tuesday. “We made very, very strong attempts to keep them and offered them a lot of money to stick around.”  In June, actors Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park exited “Hawaii Five-O.” As Variety reported at the time, the actors had been seeking equal pay with stars Alex O’Loughlin and Scott Caan, but failed to reach deals with CBS Television Studios, which produces the series.  The departure of the show’s only two series regulars of Asian descent over a salary dispute involving the pay scale of their white co-stars sparked criticism of CBS on social media and in the press.  Kahl did not go into details of the negotiation, saying, “In my mind it was purely a business transaction.” He characterized the departure of veteran actors as natural for a show entering its eighth season. “It’s happened on ‘CSI,’ it’s happened on ‘Grey’s Anatomy,’ it’s happened on ‘Law and Order: SVU.'”  Related Erinn Hayes’ Character to Be Killed Off ‘Kevin Can Wait’ to Make Room for Leah Remini  Kahl appeared at TCA alongside senior executive vice president Thom Sherman. The two fielded multiple questions about the network’s poor record with diversity in front of and behind the camera, with one reporter noting that CBS has failed to put a new series with a female lead on the air for two seasons running.  “We had six pilots with female leads and the way things turned out those pilots were not deemed to be as good as the pilots that were picked up,” Sherman said.  Sherman and Kahl did not handle the development slate that led to the upcoming season’s crop of new shows. Kahl, a 21-year veteran of the network and its longtime scheduling chief, was named CBS entertainment president in May. His promotion came with the departure of Glenn Geller, who stepped down as the network’s top programming executive following a mild heart attack suffered in March. As part of the restructuring, Sherman was recruited from sister network the CW to head programming under Kahl.  Reporters also grilled Kahl and Sherman on CBS’ casting department, which is staffed entirely by white casting directors, and how it has affected the onscreen diversity or lack thereof in CBS’ series.  “I personally don’t think that has anything to do with it,” Kahl said, adding of the casting department, “They’re fantastic at what they do,” and noting that it has “cast many diverse roles in the past.”  Pressed on why the department is staffed entirely by white casting directors, Sherman said, “They’ve been together for a long time. That’s the department as its been. But we are cognizant of the issue. We hear you, and we will be looking to expand the casting department.”  As his predecessors have, Kahl defended CBS’ diversity record and promised it would continue to improve.  “We can debate the pace of the change, but there is change happening at CBS,” Kahl said, noting an overall uptick in diverse series regulars in recent years. “Every single drama on our air has at least one diverse regular character.”  He added, “We said in the past that we’re going to do better, and we are doing better.”"

"Alicia Vikander has never been happier since tying the knot with Michael Fassbender!  Although the 29-year-old actress has rarely discussed her romantic relationship with Fassbender, in the cover story to Vogue’s March issue, Vikander opened up about how much she enjoys being married to the 40-year-old actor.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I feel I’m more happy and content than I’ve ever been,” Vikander revealed.  The pair tied the knot in a top-secret ceremony in Ibiza in October of last year. Vikander and Fassbender exchanged vows at the luxurious La Granja farmstead resort surrounded by friends and family, sources previously told PEOPLE.  Karwai Tang/WireImage  The star of the upcoming Tomb Raider reboot went on to admit that the pair — who met in late 2014 while filming The Light Between Oceans — might even consider working together again under the right circumstances.  “We had a great experience, apart from the fact that we…,” Vikander told Vogue before glancing down at her wedding ring with a laugh.  After calling her husband “one of the absolute best actors I’ve worked with,” the Academy Award-winning actress explained how even though he had more experience than she did when they began filming the movie, he never looked down on her and even asked her for advice on his character.  “Of course he’d done more films than me, but immediately when we started to work together he was so open to wanting me to chip in new ideas and thoughts,” she continued. “He would be like, ‘I’m stuck; what should I do?’ and I would say, ‘You’re asking me?’ That was such a sweet thing.”  “Life is about a lot more than work, but if it’s also your biggest passion, of course it’s something you enjoy talking about,” she added.  Dreamworks/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock  Following Vikander and Fassbender’s under-the-radar wedding, the pair honeymooned in Italy.  The couple was also spotted touring Verona and Florence, where they stopped to take a few photos with fans.

While promoting The Light Between Oceans, they spoke to Entertainment Weekly about the importance of keeping their relationship private. “I think we’ve made a clear statement that we keep certain things just between us,” Vikander said. “It was very easy to unite, but that’s quite personal.”"
"In her first interview in four years, former child star Amanda Bynes finally explained her infamous Drake tweet from 2013 by saying, “I was serious, but I was also on drugs.”  Back in 2013, a few years after the “She’s the Man” star publicly announced her retirement from acting, Bynes sent the infamous tweet, which read “I want @drake to murder my vagina.”  “That was my way of saying, ‘Let’s do it, man,'” Bynes explained in her interview with Hollyscoop founder Diana Madison, published on Friday. “I was on drugs and trying to be hilarious,” she continued. “He’s hot! What does that even mean? It just means, like, ‘F–k me, Drake!'”  Also Read: Amanda Bynes Breaks 4-Year Silence, Announces Return to Acting (Video)  Elsewhere in the 7-minute interview Bynes expressed her desire to return to acting after her short break from the limelight. “I do miss acting, and I have something surprising to tell you: I’m going to start acting again,” she said. “I want to do TV. Maybe a few guest spots on some shows that I’m a fan of and maybe another TV show where I’m the star of it, in the future. That’s what I hope.”  The former Nickelodeon star also said that she’s been sober for three years. In 2014, Bynes was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence. She had previously been booked for hitting a police car in 2012, and entered rehab the following year.  “I’ve been going to school lately, fashion school-FIDM. And I love it,” she said. “I’ve learned how to sew, I’ve made patterns, and I want to start a clothing line in the future, so FIDM has been helping me with that. Other than that I hike, I go spinning — I take spinning classes — and I feed the homeless. And that’s been really interesting and fun.”"
"Our hearts are breaking for Teen Mom 3 alum Mackenzie McKee. Her beloved mom Angie Douthit was diagnosed with brain cancer back in January, but things were looking better in March. Mack then revealed in May that her mother's cancer was spreading. ""You don’t deserve this, none of it. So happy, so healthy, and so faithful to God. Stage four cancer in your lungs, in your brain, and now in your bones,"" the reality star wrote.  Now, in an emotional post, Angie described what her “new journey” with IV chemotherapy will bring. “This morning we leave at 7:30 to begin another new journey. IV chemo. I won’t have my first treatment until Monday. I have education and nutrition classes this morning then the port will be surgically placed,” the mother-of-four began. ""As I’ve shared before, I dread chemo. However, God revealed to me that if I never had to go through IV chemo I would never fully understand cancer.""  Angie believes that by embracing her next chapter with cancer, she will be able to help others cope. “I will now completely have full knowledge of what cancer patients are talking about. I’m also going to get to meet some incredible people while I sit in that recliner for a few hours getting my drugs!” she wrote.  She concluded the post with some amazingly inspirational words. “Soak in every moment so you can use it to help others. Continue to smile and hug no matter how you might feel. Brighten someone's day, even if your day may seem bleak. Ask a friend if they need anything. Show them love, compassion, and forgiveness. Share the love of God everywhere you go, no matter where it is. Be nice!”  Just two months earlier, things were looking up for Angie. ""It’s a good day, radiation and chemo are kicking this cancer's butt!"" Angie's doctor told her during a visit. According to Angie's new scans, her brain tumors are continuing to shrink and one of the tumors in her lungs went from 7 centimeters to 2 centimeters. She also had ""hundreds"" of smaller tumors in her lungs, and because of the treatment, they are all now either inactive or gone completely. ""I will continue on the chemo pill and will have more scans in April and May,"" she revealed.  Angie's daughter Mackenzie was hit pretty hard when she found out about her mom's cancer diagnosis earlier this year. ""I’m devastated, I’m angry, I'm shook, I can’t breathe. You are everything. Please pray,"" Mackenzie wrote in the caption of a collage of photos showing her close relationship with her mom on Instagram. On Jan. 2, she revealed that her mom's sickness was worse than they originally thought. ""All prayer warriors. Please pray for my mom. What we thought was bronchitis turned out to be three masses on her brain, one large one in her lung, and multiple blood clots. We are in shock and devastated. She has brain surgery tomorrow. I’m sick. I’m so sick and want to wake up,"" she wrote.  This is my mom threatening the doctors that she will call #TheGoodDoctor 💗💕 pic.twitter.com/1U6vc3qdoQ — Mackenzie McKee (@DouthitKenzie) January 3, 2018  The news was extra shocking considering how fit and active Angie is. In November, they actually competed in a diabetes awareness run together, and her mom blew her out of the water! ""Thanks, Mom, for always setting a good example of health and fitness in my life,"" Mackenzie gushed at the time.  Mackenzie mentioned how well her mom treats her body in an interview with Us Weekly. ""She is the healthiest person I know,"" she said. ""Eats healthier than me. Always organic. Doesn’t smoke, doesn’t drink, she is a school teacher so [she] has no money. She runs marathons and works out two to three times a day. This does not run in our family,"" she revealed.

(Photo: Nick Ut, AP)Bumble Bee Foods and two managers were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors Monday with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna.Jose Melena was performing maintenance in a 35-foot-long oven at the company's Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn Oct. 11, 2012, when a co-worker, who mistakenly believed Melena was in the bathroom, filled the pressure cooker with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and it was turned on.When a supervisor noticed Melena, 62, was missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened.The company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone's working on it.Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said.

"Maxine Waters (D-CA) is one of the most unpleasant people to ever hold be a public servant. She is always, angry, something that she wears as a badge of honor. She has pushed the lie about President Trump having Russian connections and has even had to admit that no facts exists to condemn the White House for.Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that “Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.”Known in some circles as “the Poverty Pimp,” Waters has been peddling race baiting, socialist agenda’s, and a hatred for President that borders is obsessive, she has accomplished very little in her career.Even today, she finds herself above impeachment and was so terribly rude to one of her own constituents that watching the video of it is cringe worthy, to say the least.On top of that, she seems to imply that as a woman of color, she can not be thrown out of office.While the word “color” may have been been “Congress” since she mumbles more than speaks, it is clear that race over substance matters is the Waters credo.Then again, when one attends only 10% of the meetings that are expected of them, there is not much other than skin color for her to drivel on about. She has not real record to run on, only that she is a minority.Thankfully, even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service.Still, America was well aware that Waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, we just never knew how little time she spent there.Come to think of it, considering her views, it may, in fact, be better if she spent even less time there!Sources: Teddy Stick – 1tch"
"Vanessa Grimaldi is moving past her heartbreak.  Six months ago, fans of ABC’s The Bachelor watched Nick Viall and the Canada native fall in love and get engaged on last season’s finale. Five months later, the duo announced their split, saying in a statement, “We gave this relationship our all and we are saddened that we did not get the fairytale ending we hoped for.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Now, the 29-year-old is opening up about why things didn’t work out and how she plans on moving forward.  “My relationship with Nick and experience on The Bachelor has given me so many amazing and memorable moments in my life, and I am forever grateful,” Grimaldi exclusively tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue. “Nick and I were always transparent about the challenges in a relationship. We certainly had ours. I fell for him hard, and when you fall in love that hard, your heart breaks even harder.”  David Crotty/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images  “In the end, as much as we loved each other and tried to make it work, we just realized we were different people fighting to keep a relationship when ultimately we just weren’t’ the best fit for each other,” she adds. “It wasn’t the distance that was ever an issue. Both Nick and I decided together, with our families’ support, that I would put my teaching career on hold and uproot my life to Los Angeles to support him on Dancing with the Stars and build a life together.”  MARLON KUHNREICH  Of the emotional Instagram she posted last week, Grimaldi tells PEOPLE, “I wanted to share that message with the world. Whatever hardships people are going through, don’t be embarrassed of feeling no feelings – if it’s anger, hurt, sadness – just remember at the end of the day to remain optimistic, because you will come out of it, and you’ll come out it a stronger person. It always will be okay in the end.”  Viall appeared on two previous seasons of The Bachelorette and season 3 of Bachelor in Paradise before taking his turn as the lead suitor.  Even before getting engaged, L.A.-based Viall and Canadian Grimaldi struggled to decide where they would continue their relationship.  Viall is handling the split “okay,” a source previously told PEOPLE. “It wasn’t an overnight decision, and they’re amicable.”  “There’s no one set way to get over heartbreak,” Grimaldi says now. “When going through any hardship, it’s okay to take the time to grieve the loss of what could have been. It’s okay to cry and curl up under your covers for as long as you need. I’m not ashamed to say that I’ve done all of those things, but with my family’s and close friend’s support – it’s all really helped the process for me.”  MARLON KUHNREICH  “I’m trying to look forward now and remain positive,” she adds. “It’s hard sometimes, breakups aren’t easy, letting go of the idea of what could’ve been isn’t easy, either, but I’m trying to stay optimistic about the future and that one day the person that I’m meant to be with and start a family with — when the timing is right — we will find our way to each other.”  In the end, Grimaldi came out of this a stronger person and wants nothing but the best for Viall.  “When you fall in love with someone with all that you have, it’s hard to let go. Every part of you gets shattered,” she says. “I’m trying to pick up the pieces. … I hope he finds his person and his happily ever after that we unfortunately couldn’t find together.”"

"CLOSE They took their Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan fandom to a whole new level. USA TODAY Sports  Former Olympian Tonya Harding  Tonya Harding has long denied she knew a plan was afoot to injure Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.  That, actually, was not the case, Harding said in Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story that aired on ABC on Thursday night. In fact, she said she basically figured out that her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and his friend, Shawn Eckardt, had likely been behind the plot to attack Kerrigan shortly after she won the U.S. figure skating title.  Harding stuck to her story that she's repeated for 24 years now: She had no role in planning the attack. In part of the interview that ran on Good Morning America earlier this week, Harding, however, said she did overhear Gillooly and Eckardt talking about ""taking somebody out"" to ensure Harding made the 1994 U.S. Olympic team.  ""It popped in my head two or three days after we got back (that Gillooly and Eckardt were involved),"" Harding said in part of the interview that didn't run until the two-hour special Thursday night.  MORE: Tonya Harding threatens to end interview with Piers Morgan  The special comes as I, Tonya, a sympathetic look at Harding's life that is in theaters, has received critical acclaim.  But Harding's mother isn't fan.  “I don’t give a (expletive) about the movie,"" said LaVona ""Sandy"" Golden, who was played by Allison Janney in the movie. ""I don’t care how it portrays me. I could care less about that movie than the dirt outside.”  MORE: Harding, mother give differing accounts of abuse, drinking  Janney, who won the best supporting actress in a motion picture at the Golden Globes on Sunday, portrayed Golden as a physically and mentally abusive mother.  Golden admitted to using a hairbrush to ""spank"" Harding at a competition, but denied she was habitually abusive toward Harding. Golden also denied she ever threw a steak knife that struck Harding in the arm during an argument.  “Take a lie detector (expletive),"" Harding said in response to her mother's denials.  MORE: 5 things we learned on the set of the crazy Tonya Harding biopic 'I, Tonya'  Kerrigan bristled during her short segment on the special when asked if her popularity is owed to the attack in Detroit.  ""I have two Olympics medals,"" Kerrigan said. ""They didn’t just give them to me. I worked hard for it. Who in their right mind would ask to be attacked? I would never wish that anyone. If I could change that, would I? Of course I would.”  Harding didn't deny the incident helped create more of a buzz around U.S. women's figure skating.  ""Sure. Why not?"" Harding said. ""I mean, I was there. I skated.”  Harding was convicted of hindering the prosecution in the aftermath of the attack on Kerrigan. She was spared prison time, unlike Gillooly, Eckardt and two men who carried out the attack (Shane Stant and getaway driver Derrick Smith).  ""Enough apologizing,"" Harding said. ""She has her life. I have my life. We both have wonderful lives. That should be all that matters.""  PHOTOS: Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan"

"Caitlyn Jenner has been spotted sporting hearing aids, sparking fears the transgender star may be heading toward another transition — deafness, but thankfully, the former Olympian has new girlfriend Sophia Hutchins as a shoulder to lean on.  Jenner, 68, was snapped wearing the devices during her recent beach holiday in Mexico with her 21-year-old new trans arm candy.  “Cait’s hearing has gotten worse over the years, and she can’t hear much without them,” a source told RadarOnline.com exclusively. “She’s tried covering them up with her hair, but the beach wind exposed them to the world!”  Sophia, a student at California’s Pepperdine University, credits the famous former athlete for inspiring her gender reassignment surgery.

"Here's some drama that's aged well.  To start, we just want to iterate that we don't condone violence of any kind.  Now that we've got that out of the way, we also weren't terribly upset to hear this story about how Jason Priestley once punched Harvey Weinstein in the face at a Miramax Golden Globes afterparty in 1995.  The actor tweeted that at the height of his Beverly Hills 90210 stardom, he got into a bit of a scrum with the now-disgraced movie mogul. The tiff escalated and ended with Priestley being hauled out of the party by security after he hurled a jab Weinstein's way.  The drama was dragged into the spotlight on Monday after Mira Sorvino tweeted her reaction to the confirmation that Weinstein had blacklisted her for rebuffing his advances, telling director Peter Jackson not to hire her or fellow actress Ashley Judd. ""There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure,"" she wrote.  In response to her tweet, actress Tara Strong speculated that perhaps Priestley had been blacklisted by the producer as well after he punched him in the face. Priestley replied that it probably was not true, as he did not work with Weinstein, but, for our reading pleasure, he recounted the details of their encounter 22 years ago.  ""Harvey told me I had to leave... I was leaving when he grabbed me by the arm and said 'what are you doing?'"" tweeted Priestley. ""I said 'you told me leave, I’m leaving.'""  Priestley continued that there was a bit more back-and-forth drama about whether or not Weinstein had told the actor to leave, and then things got heated and Weinstein got punched.  Some drama is truly timeless.  Read the full exchange below.  Just seeing this after I awoke, I burst out crying. There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure. Thank you Peter Jackson for being honest. I’m just heartsick https://t.co/ljK9NqICbm — Mira Sorvino (@MiraSorvino) December 15, 2017  IDK about that @tarastrong... I know I never worked for Miramax... and boy was my team HORRIFIED when they heard about what I had done! Harvey was powerful, my team STRONGLY ADVISED me to write him an apology the next day... — Jason Priestley (@Jason_Priestley) December 17, 2017  Of course there is more to the story... ‘95 Golden Globes... at the Miramax Party...

I was leaving when he grabbed me by the arm and said “ what are you doing?” I said “ you told me leave, I’m leaving” — Jason Priestley (@Jason_Priestley) December 15, 2017  “I didn’t say you had to leave” he replied. “You just told me to leave... right over there” I tell him once again.

"The dragged-out divorce talks between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have hit yet another snag — since Jolie wants to take their six kids with her to London to film the blockbuster sequel “Maleficent 2.”  Hollywood sources familiar with the film tell Page Six that Jolie is furious since she wants to bring the couple’s brood with her while the film shoots, at the same time their custody battle continues to brew since their 2016 split.  “They are figuring out how it would work, but she is not happy,” said a source. The source explained, “She wants to take the kids to London with her while she’s shooting — and she’s frustrated with the process. They’re talking about how it would work.”  A source said that Jolie’s been so miffed by the situation, “Even the people around her are getting tired of it.”  The celebrity couple is privately still hammering out their split, including custody of their kids, Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh and twins Vivienne and Knox.  Page Six reported in February that talks were cordial, but they are still ongoing.  At the same time, Jolie’s next project, “Maleficent 2” — the sequel to the 2014 original that made $759 million — is gearing up. The production on Wednesday cast British “Interstellar” actor David Gyasi to join the film that also reportedly stars Elle Fanning, Michelle Pfeiffer and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Reps did not comment.  Meanwhile on Wednesday, Pitt’s ex-fiancée Gwyneth Paltrow recalled to Howard Stern how Pitt years ago warned Hollywood troll Harvey Weinstein to stay away from her.  “We were at the opening of ‘Hamlet’ on Broadway, and Harvey was there,” said Paltrow, who’s since publicly alleged she was sexually harassed by Weinstein.  She said Pitt “told me exactly what he said” to Weinstein.  “He said, ‘If you ever make her feel uncomfortable again, I’ll kill you.’ ” She told Stern the move was “like the equivalent of throwing him against the wall, energetically . . . he leveraged his fame and power to protect me at a time when I didn’t have fame or power yet.”  Related Video 1:30 Angelina Jolie went grocery shopping with the common folk"
"And while Kim and Kanye ""don't care"" about the song and think that it's ""pathetic"", the rapper is reportedly outraged that Tay has mocked the incident in her music video.  Vevo  “He was upset that Taylor exploited Kim’s robbery,” a source close to the rapper told HollywoodLife.com.  “Kanye feels like that was not cool because the incident was a very serious and dangerous situation.”  Ultimately, he ""just feels as though it’s something that Taylor shouldn’t have mocked.”  Kanye isn't the only one to have said this as many critics and fans have slammed Tay for making light of the robbery.  But at the end of the day, Tay hasn't *actually* confirmed that the scene is about the Paris attack.  It could have been a reference to her sexual assault trial as a single dollar bill can be seen in the tub which is all Taylor wanted from winning the case.  It could also be a nod to that time when Taylor made the following statement about the media:  ""Every single article had these descriptions of my personality that were very different from the actual personality and my first reaction was like, that's a bummer, this isn't fun for me. But then my second reaction ended up being like, hey, that's actually a really interesting character they're writing about. 'She jetsets around the world collecting men and she can get any of them but she's so clingy that they leave and she cries and she gets another one in her web and she traps them and locks them in her mansion and she's crying in her marble bathtub surrounded by pearls.' So I was like, I could use this...""  Vevo  So in summary: have a seat Kanye."

"A Married at First Sight star whose wife verbally abused him when they were off camera has revealed that they were getting a divorce following their latest blowup.  Jonathan Francetic, 29, watched his wife Molly Duff, 25, move out of their shared apartment immediately after he showed one of the show's relationship experts a recording of her calling him 'f*****g disgusting' during an argument.  On Tuesday night's episode of the Lifetime reality series, Jonathan and Molly both told their family and friends that they were getting a divorce after less than two months together.  Scroll down for video  Not-so-shocking: Jonathan Francetic, 29, and his wife Molly Duff, 25, told their family and friends that they were getting a divorce on Tuesday night's episode of the reality show  Drama: Jonathan recounted to his friend Blake how he and Molly had moved out after he showed one of the show's relationship experts a recording of her verbally abusing him  'It feels like failure,' Jonathan told the camera before meeting his friend Blake to share the bad news.  The former financial associate, who lost his job when he agreed to appear on the reality series, recounted how he and Molly had gotten into a fight during their recent trip to Florida.  Jonathan explained that he recorded her belittling him to show the experts because she was a completely different person when the cameras weren't rolling.  'We have already determined that we were getting divorced,' he told his friend.  'I've put so much into this marriage that I'm devastated,' he admitted in his testimonial.  Dunzo: 'We have already determined that we were getting divorced,' he told his friend  Awkward: The former financial associate, who lost his job when he agreed to appear on the reality series, also had to tell the other male participants about the divorce  Harsh words: Meanwhile, Ryan Buckley (left), 29, claimed that he wouldn't be heartbroken at all if he and his wife Jaclyn Schwartzberg, 29, got a divorce  Molly, meanwhile, failed to mention the recording when she told her sister Jenny that she had moved out of their apartment.  'It's very obvious at this point that we both want a divorce,' she said. 'He's made it very clear.'  Both Jonathan and Molly were dreading their separate get-togethers with the show's other participants because they knew they would have to admit that they were getting a divorce.  'I have to tell them my marriage is just over,' Jonathan said. 'I feel like a loser.'  He was once again forced to recount how he recorded Molly berating him and showed it to Dr. Jessica Griffin, who pointed out that it was verbal and emotional abuse.  Uncomfortable: Molly also felt awkward telling Jaclyn (right) and Shawniece Jackson, 29, that she was getting a divorce  Playing innocent: Molly once again glossed over specifics when she explained why she and Jonathan were giving up on their marriage  'Molly and I have already decided that it's a no,' he said. 'We both know that we are walking into decision day saying no.'  Although Jonathan and Molly were the only couple who didn't consummate their marriage, the other guys were understandably shocked by the revelation.  Meanwhile, Molly once again glossed over specifics when she told the girls that she had moved out and was getting a divorce.  She claimed their marriage couldn't work if their physical chemistry didn't increase, noting that Jonathan was unable to be patient with her without constantly blowing up over their lack of intimacy.  Towards the end of the episode, Jonathan had to tell his mom, Cheryl, and stepfather, Richard, that he and Molly were calling it quits.  Stressed: Jonathan was understandably nervous before telling his mom, Cheryl, and stepfather, Richard, that he and Molly were getting a divorce  Family ties: However, they were nothing but supportive after he shared his news  He explained that the visit was even more awkward because his mother had expected Molly to be with him. Cheryl was invested in their marriage and had already exchanged phone numbers with Molly's mom.  However, when Jonathan told them that he was getting a divorce, they were nothing but supportive. His stepfather even told him that he admired him for taking a chance on love.  Jonathan was the only person on the show who gave up his apartment for good, and now he was trying to figure out where to live.  'I don't have a job, so I can pick any place,' he joked. '[It is the] silver lining of being homeless and unemployed.'  While Jonathan was away, Jaclyn Schwartzberg, 29, went over their apartment to help Molly pack. Molly said she had sent a long text to Jonathan in hopes that they could part amicably and leave the show in a good place, but he never responded.  Tough luck: When Jaclyn helped Molly pack her things, Molly revealed that she had sent a long text to Jonathan in hopes that they could party amicably, but he didn't respond  Blindsided: Jaclyn was shocked when Ryan told her that he hadn't decided what he was going to say on decision day  The couple's breakup was weighing on the rest of the newlyweds, who were also unsure if they were on the verge of getting a divorce.  When he had the guys over to his apartment, Jaclyn's husband Ryan Buckley, 29, confessed that he was having trouble talking to his wife, explaining that she shuts down whenever he shares his concerns that their constant fighting was unhealthy.  Not only did he admit that he didn't feel close to her anymore, he claimed he didn't even care about her.  'If I were to cut ties, I honestly wouldn't be heartbroken at all,' he said, pointing out that it was a warning sign that he didn't feel anything when he thought about divorcing his wife.  Both Jonathan and Jephte Pierre, 26, thought Ryan was all over the place with his feelings and was likely acting out of fear.  Stunned: 'I thought we both knew that we wanted to see this past decision day, at least because we had so much going for us,' she said  Back on? Just when Jaclyn though their marriage was doomed, he surprised her with a necklace made out of flowers from their wedding day  Giving it another go: Ryan and Jaclyn shared a kiss after making up yet again  When Jaclyn returned home from her girls' night, he made it clear that he was on the fence about their marriage, which left her feeling blindsided.  'I am completely caught off guard,' she said in her testimonial. 'I thought we both knew that we wanted to see this past decision day, at least because we had so much going for us.  'I know we've had our battles and our wounds, but I thought we were on the same page, so I am feeling very blindsided.'  Ironically, just when Jaclyn though their marriage was doomed, he surprised her with a necklace made out of flowers from their wedding day as an apology for how he had been treating her.  And Ryan wasn't the only one going to extremes. Jephte also ended up picking a silly fight with his wife Shawniece Jackson, 29, after they had a disagreement over who would drive that day.  Trouble in paradise: Shawniece and Jephte go into a fight about who was going to drive  Confused: 'My husband is mad because I didn't end up driving, and like why does that matter?' she said in her testimonial  'My husband is mad because I didn't end up driving, and like why does that matter?' she asked, while her husband confessed to the cameras that her behavior had left him questioning whether or not she was the person he really wanted to be with forever.  Although Shawniece didn't believe it was a big deal that she decided she didn't want to take her car that day, Jephte thought it was a warning sign that she wasn't a woman of her word.  'I am still figuring out who she is, and I don't like when you say something and then do something different,' he admitted in his testimonial.  'I'm not sure if that's the person I want to be spending the rest of my life with,' he added.  Shawniece, on the other hand, seemed more confident in her own decision, but noted that the stress of the show's finale may have had a negative impact on her husband as he attempted to figure out his future.  Tense: Jephte admitted that he was not sure Shawniece was the type of person he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, while she was nervous that he was going to ask for a divorce  Bouncing back: Although Jephte seemed genuinely upset at first, he ended up diffusing the situation by joking around and laughing with her  'Maybe he is just stressed out — I guess about final decision — so who knows?' she said of his behavior.  With decision day right around the corner, Shawniece was worried that their latest squabble could be a sign that they are headed for divorce.  'When he gets super annoyed with me, it just makes me really nervous and really scared for the future 'cause we only have a few days before final decision,' she says in her testimonial.  Although Jephte seemed genuinely upset at first, he ended up diffusing the situation by joking around and laughing with her.  'I am just proud that we are able to come back from the situation and be at the place where I know we can be,' Shawniece told the camera."
